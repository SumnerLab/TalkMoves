Do you want to say it to the camera	No I don t want to say it	sd	1
No I don t want to say it	This is going to be the number in the square multiplied by itself plus one always is going to give you the answer	sd	4
Yeah what have you written here that s very interesting	Zero times zero plus one equals one	sd	5
Do you want to do it	Not really	sd	1
Let me give you the microphone	Uh I don t want to	sd	1
But it s a great idea	But what am I going to say though	sd	1
Well you can say here this is a good idea	That s easy	sd	1
Here s the microphone let me get out of the way	How am I going to do this though	sd	3
Well here s what you can do	Can I draw it on this	sd	1
Well you could	Yeah I ll just draw it on this and show it as an example	sd	1
Yeah I ll just draw it on this and show it as an example	When am I going	sd	1
So um Jeff is going to tell you about this problem right here	Well what it is no	sd	1
Well what it is no	Can I start	sd	1
Can I start	OK	sd	1
OK	The number over in the box is always going to multiply by itself in the parenthesis and then you re going to add it by one and you ll get the number that s supposed to be in the triangle	sd	5
The number over in the box is always going to multiply by itself in the parenthesis and then you re going to add it by one and you ll get the number that s supposed to be in the triangle	The same thing with this one here one times one is one plus one equals two	sd	5
The same thing with this one here one times one is one plus one equals two	Two times two is four plus one equals five and it just works for the rest of the six	sd	5
Two times two is four plus one equals five and it just works for the rest of the six	Is that it	sd	1
See if you can you helped them get it can you come and explain it to the camera	Yes	aa	1
Yes	OK you can talk this time	sd	1
OK you can talk this time	Well you see that number is the same as that number the code would be square times square plus one equals triangle	sd	5
Yeah that s neat but you didn t write it that way	I didn t put the square	sd	1
Because the rule says whatever you write in one square you have to write the same in the other square	That s the same as that	sd	4
That s very nice OK why don t you write it on this paper now	You could write it	sd	1
You could write it	Oh come on	sd	1
Oh come on	Just write the code	sd	1
Thank you very much	When you minus this one from this one you get the multiplying number	sd	5
Yeah why don t you say that to the camera	I already did	sd	1
It doesn t work for all of them	Could we tell everybody the code	sd	1
OK let me say the people with the secret would like to publish it now when scientists really discovered something they do what they call publishing they send it to a journal and it gets printed and everybody reads it	You have the box time that plus one is the triangle	sd	4
You have the box time that plus one is the triangle	Someone pick a number that will go like here	sd	2
OK Ankur says tell him a number and he ll tell you how it works	Eightysix	sd	4
Eightysix	Eightysix is too high	sd	2
Eightysix is too high	They want eightysix we ll give them eightysix	sd	2
They want eightysix we ll give them eightysix	We don t care just show us how to do it	sd	1
We don t care just show us how to do it	They re just going to do eighty six to make us mad	sd	1
They re just going to do eighty six to make us mad	Now what s eighty six times eightysix you said eightysix now figure that out	sd	3
Now what s eighty six times eightysix you said eightysix now figure that out	You said you could solve	sd	1
You said you could solve	Do it	sd	1
Do it	We can if we had a piece of paper	sd	1
We can if we had a piece of paper	If you have the number here and the number here is going to be the same as the number here what do you think that is going to be for the code	sd	3
OK this is really the key pint so it would be very important to listen carefully because they re really telling you the secret	If the number here is going to be the same as the umber here what shape do you think that is going to be	sd	3
If the number here is going to be the same as the umber here what shape do you think that is going to be	A square	b	2
A square	That s it that s the whole thing that s the code	sd	2
That s it that s the whole thing that s the code	That s the code	sd	2
That s the code	Isn t that easy	sd	1
Isn t that easy	That s the code  square times square plus one equals triangle	sd	2
That s what you had too isn t it	I told you	qy	1
I told you	That isn t very difficult If we knew what it was we just didn t put it down how it was supposed to be	sd	1
How could we rewrite this as  a math sentence as a number sentence	One divided by one sixth equals  six	sd	5
One divided by one sixth equals  six	One  whole minus six sixths is zero	sd	5
One  whole minus six sixths is zero	One whole	sd	5
One whole	One whole minus	sd	2
One whole minus	five sixths equals one sixth	sd	5
five sixths equals one sixth	No no no no no	sd	2
No no no no no	I have an idea	sd	1
I have an idea	No	b	1
No	No give  me a pencil	sd	1
No give  me a pencil	Look this is one	sd	1
Look this is one	One is equal to  six sixths	sd	5
One is equal to  six sixths	Does it have to be division	sd	1
Does it have to be division	Does it  have to be a division problem	sd	1
Does it  have to be a division problem	One divided by six is not six sixths	sd	2
One divided by six is not six sixths	I didnt say it was	sd	2
I didnt say it was	One divided by I  think if youre doing a division problem you  could do one divided by one sixth equal six  because it was like what we did when our  parents were here we did one divided by  one eighth equals eight so it was like well  what how many eighths are in one	sd	5
Do you agree with that Danielle	Uh yeah but I so its like every number its  that its one divided by the fraT2ion and then  just the plain number	sd	2
I  think thats something we need to do some  more exploring with to see if that works so  well do some more problems to see if thats  the case	Its just like saying six divided by uh it  would be like the same thing kind of	sd	5
Its just like saying six divided by uh it  would be like the same thing kind of	Six  divided by one sixth equals what	sd	5
Six  divided by one sixth equals what	And then  you check it	sd	5
I dont want to just give you the  answer on that I want you to think about it  some more	One whole	sd	4
Think about that	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Wait of course I can	sd	1
Wait of course I can	One whole  nah six sixths divided by	sd	4
One whole  nah six sixths divided by	One divided by one sixth equals	sd	2
One divided by one sixth equals	I  know	aa	1
I  know	One divided by one sixth equals six  sixths	sd	5
One divided by one sixth equals six  sixths	What	ba	3
What	That doesnt make sense	aa	2
That doesnt make sense	How do you spell division	qy	1
How do you spell division	DIVISION  something like that	sd	1
DIVISION  something like that	No youre not taking away when you divide	sd	2
Thats  a good question	No youre doing subtraT2ion	sd	4
No youre doing subtraT2ion	No see	b	2
No see	Do we have a pen	sd	1
How is it related to subtraT2ion Michael	See look	sd	1
And one divided by one sixth equals six  because theres six one sixths in one	Yeah thats what I mean	sd	1
Yeah thats what I mean	So six divided by one if you do six times one	sd	4
So six divided by one if you do six times one	But she said six sixths I would agree with  six but not six sixths	sd	2
But she said six sixths I would agree with  six but not six sixths	equals six minus equals zero	sd	5
equals six minus equals zero	Its uh one  divided by one sixth	sd	5
Alright	But not six sixths	sd	2
Michael	We were working on the candy bar problem	sd	1
We were working on the candy bar problem	Like with like which  is bigger a half or one third and we were using candy bars to show  that	sd	4
Andrew	Yeah we were working on we had to write about um and we had to  do an example on it and um to see if which is bigger one half or one  third	sd	4
One half or one third	One half	sd	4
And see if you can convince us of  your result	Well um one third would be just this piece here  and one half of that would be  and one half would be this  and one third  is bigger than one half cause this  would be one third and  then this bigger piece  would be one half of that	sd	5
Can you tell me what number name you re calling the orange and the  red rod	Um one	sd	4
Can you say that again  what number names gave to each of those rods so I can hear from  back here	You say	sd	1
You say	Um this would be this we re  counting this as one whole  and I think this   has two and this  has wait um	sd	4
Um this would be this we re  counting this as one whole  and I think this   has two and this  has wait um	Um   um I can t we called it yeah  I think  this one was one	sd	4
Um   um I can t we called it yeah  I think  this one was one	That was one third	sd	2
That was one third	this was one third and this was one half	sd	2
this was one third and this was one half	One half	sd	2
Audra what do  you think of what  the two young ladies built up there	I agree because	sd	2
Want to speak to the class	I agree because if you saw what the um half  was here and then you saw what no what the half was here and then  you saw what the third was there and you saw that the half was  bigger than the third	sd	5
Ok did you figure out  how much bigger	It s two two	sd	4
It s two two	It s a red bigger but	sd	4
Ok you re saying it s a red rod bigger or two white ones but that s  what I see you have built there but I would like you to tell me what  number name you have for how much bigger it is	Um wait it s one third bigger I think	sd	4
Um wait it s one third bigger I think	I think it s one third bigger too because if you put the red to the  green	sd	2
I think it s one third bigger too because if you put the red to the  green	You d see that there s three	sd	2
You d see that there s three	You need three and if you put the purple one to it also and then it  takes one third of them	sd	5
What do you think do you agree with this	Um yes	aa	1
You agree with them	Well if you have um a red if you hold um well if you have um  well we used these and we went like and then we like held reds up  and we showed that um that um one half is bigger by because this  part is smaller and this is supposed to be one one third so that s  how we did it	sd	5
Do you agree with  them	Not really	sd	2
Oh hmm	If you take this and it has three thirds	sd	4
And you re calling this one third	And we re calling this	sd	1
And you re calling this one third	One third	sd	1
And you re saying one half  is bigger than one third by one third	Yeah you can put three of these three reds up to one green  and then it would take one one third of the red to make um to go  there like	sd	5
Brian what do  you think	Well when they said one third is bigger than one half by one third	sd	2
Well when they said one third is bigger than one half by one third	I  think they said is that what they said	sd	2
I  think they said is that what they said	Well I don t really agree  because well if you split if you split one of the thirds in half which  would make  which would make a sixth	sd	5
Well I don t really agree  because well if you split if you split one of the thirds in half which  would make  which would make a sixth	I  think it s a sixth bigger	sv	5
I  think it s a sixth bigger	Like well  um should I go  up there	sd	1
Maybe you  need to have a little conference here we have some disagreement	Well see for um when they said it was  one half bigger if you split a third in half itd make a sixth like one  two three four five six	sd	5
Well see for um when they said it was  one half bigger if you split a third in half itd make a sixth like one  two three four five six	Like like pretending they were like  pretending they were split in half	sd	5
Like like pretending they were like  pretending they were split in half	If you split one of these in half  and you have three of them up there they d make they d make six  and any way and when you split them in half right in the middle  over there it s kind of like that it s kind of like this there was this  was that was the one third  and that was the  one half  on the bottom and so it s just  like this and the red I m pretending is like is like is a half of one of  the purples and you see when I split it in half it s it s one sixth and  and it equals and it equals up to a green	sd	5
I m hearing you say Brian that the number name for red is one sixth  and the reason why is	Well I mean a red I m considering a red one sixth   because two of these  equals see they re two they re two  sixths two halves of one purple and the purple is a third and the half  of one third is sixth there s sixths	sd	5
Well I mean a red I m considering a red one sixth   because two of these  equals see they re two they re two  sixths two halves of one purple and the purple is a third and the half  of one third is sixth there s sixths	I sit right here	sd	1
That yeah that can work the same for you	Its on	sd	1
Its on	You got no homework	sd	1
I gueStudents I better put the lights back on	MiStudents  I have a	sd	1
What	My homework	sd	1
Okay get your aStudentsignment and go ahead and put it away for now	Oh my gosh	sd	1
Oh my gosh	The next aStudentsignment	sd	1
Okay	MiStudents  are we Do we need paper	sd	1
Yes	Do you have some paper	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Yes Austin	Do you want us to put our folders up  put it in	sd	1
I will give you a sheet that were gonna work on today that you can take notes on	Okay	b	1
The only thing you need on your desk is this piece of paper Im gonna give you and a pencil	Do we need a calculator	sd	1
No	Want our book	sd	1
Send that five to that other group back there	I forgot my book at home	sd	1
I forgot my book at home	Im a bad girl	sd	1
Okay	Where do I sit	sd	1
Where do I sit	Right there	aa	1
Right there	Right there	aa	1
You didnt get one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	He has one	sd	1
He has one	Yeah	b	1
Now two to the fourth is how much	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Thats	sd	1
So two to the fifth would be how much	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Twentyfive	sd	2
Twentyfive	No	b	2
No	Twenty	sd	4
Look at the growth	Its very big	sd	4
Two to the three was	Eight	sd	4
What do you think that graphs gonna look like	It a curve	sd	4
Yes	Become a parabola if you go to the negative side	sd	4
If we think about this what does two squared mean	Two times two	sd	4
And what does two cubed mean	Two times two times two	sd	4
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	sd	4
What would this equal	Two to the fifth power	sd	4
What is this telling me now that I have parentheses	You have to multiply it by	sd	4
You have to multiply it by	You have to do	sd	1
Two to the third power times two to the	Third power	sd	4
We have because its squared	What	ba	3
Right	Is is that the same thing as doing two to the third power and then just like getting the answer	sd	4
Two	Times two	sd	4
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	sd	1
And what do we get here if I write it as a final power	Two to the sixth power	sd	4
Now for the last example whats being squared here	The X	sd	4
The X	One X	sd	2
One X	The two	sd	2
The two	Two X	sd	2
This is	Two X	sd	4
Two X	Two X	sd	2
Two times X times two times	X	b	4
Right	Oh	b	1
Is that any different	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
And this is two squared times	X squared	sd	4
X squared	X squared	sd	2
Okay	Oh	b	1
Expand those out like I did on the board please	Can I  by expanding	sd	4
Can I  by expanding	Right	b	2
Good	Okay	b	1
And then give us the final answer	So you want us to just tree branch off and just	sd	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Yes Brett	Just asking am I doing it right	sd	1
Just asking am I doing it right	Is that right	aa	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
DiscuStudents it with your group	Do we do you want us to do our rule thing too	sv	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	I already know what	sd	1
I already know what	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	sd	4
Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	No	sd	2
No	Otherwise you just	sd	1
Otherwise you just	No	b	2
No	Youre not	sd	1
Okay	Well yeah that too but what did you guys get for the rule	sd	3
Did you come up with a rule	You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	sd	4
You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	I I understand	sd	1
If you say youre gonna add exponents how would you write that	A plus N equals equals	sd	4
Whats your base in this problem	A	b	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Did I do this right	sd	1
Very good	You would say add the exponents	sd	4
You would say add the exponents	The exponents to	sd	2
The exponents to	Add the exponents to find your base	sd	2
So youre just saying that youre gonna yeah	To find your base exponent	sd	4
To find your base exponent	Or how would you say add the add the exponents	sd	3
Or how would you say add the add the exponents	How would you what would you call it	aa	3
Add the exponents is sufficient	Add the exponents	sd	1
Add the exponents	So you have to add the exponents	sd	4
So then show me that	you know how to spell it right	sd	1
Robert what did you find out	What oh I was gonna ask you a question	sd	1
Ask the question	Do we have to write it in words	sd	1
You can you can do it in symbols Robert	Okay	b	1
Okay	In that case we are	sd	1
If I A to the M times A to the N what did we find out when we multiplied	A to the M plus N	sd	4
What did you get Chad	A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	sd	4
A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	No thats not right	sd	2
No thats not right	No	b	2
So then you found so how would I do it if I had A to the two to the four	You would A to the sixth	sd	4
You would A to the sixth	So you just add it	sd	1
What does parentheses stand for in math	Multiplication	aa	4
So would someone seeing this say oh multiplication or addition do you think	Multiplication	aa	4
Multiplication	Multiplication	aa	2
How can I show it such that its being added	What Robert says	sd	2
So are yes Austin	I got A and then 27	sd	4
On which problem	On the rule	sd	1
On the rule	For the rule	sd	1
Okay	I said N is A to N to the A B Cs is 13	sd	5
Right	Yeah	b	1
Cause if you look at the first problem we had A square times A to the fourth and we got A to the	Sixth	aa	4
So two plus one is	Three	sd	4
For number two	Yeah	b	1
So three plus one plus four is	Eight	sd	4
Cause when you expand it youll be able to see the pattern much more quickly	Okay	b	1
Okay	Three A two two	sd	4
Three A two two	MiStudents	sd	1
Yes	When you do this three you break that	sv	4
Whats in the inside part	The two A squared	sd	4
And how many times would you have A squared	Three oh three times	sd	4
Three oh three times	Oh three times	sd	2
So write that out	you would break it down and right	sd	4
Can you break that down even further now	I did	sd	1
Whats A squared look like	A times A	sd	4
And then you have to have how many sets of those	A multiplied by A	sd	4
A multiplied by A	Three	sd	2
Three	Three	sd	2
Three	Three	sd	2
So then you write that out and youve expanded it	Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	sd	5
Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	So it would be A to the sixth	sd	5
A to the	So it would be A to the	sd	4
So make sure you expand it out	Thats	ba	1
Thats	Thats what I got	sd	1
Lucia did you have a question	Oh I get it	sd	1
Oh I get it	I get it	sd	1
I get it	No I was asking the same thing as she did but I heard you explain it	sd	1
Whats that	How you Im gonna just write it three times write this three times	sd	1
Then how do you break out for your A squared	Two As	sd	4
Right	Yeah	b	1
So how many As do you end up with	A to the sixth	sd	4
A to the sixth	So then itll be A to the sixth	sd	4
So then itll be A to the sixth	He got A to the fifth	sd	2
He got A to the fifth	How did you all get six As	sd	3
How did you all get six As	I got five As	sd	4
I got five As	Because two times three is six	sd	5
Did you do okay	And thats  six	sd	4
Show him	So see you do	sd	1
Explain to Chad how that works	Here	sd	1
Here	If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	sd	5
If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	sd	5
cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	So basically I iStudentt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	sd	4
So basically I iStudentt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	The number by that	sd	4
So youre gonna multiply your exponents right	Yeah	b	1
Did you guys have it	So you multiplied the two and three and got six	sd	5
So you multiplied the two and three and got six	Yep	b	1
Yep	Yeah	b	1
You have your rule	Oh	sd	1
Dont forget to do your rule if you have determined it with your group	All right	aa	1
Yes	Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	sd	4
Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	Can we show it anyway we want	sd	1
Thats thats exactly yes	Hi	b	1
Hi	Im on TV	sd	1
Yes	How do you do this one	qy	3
How do you do this one	It said like	sd	1
It said like	So on number five we	sd	1
Right	Yeah	b	1
And how many times do you need A squared	Three	sd	4
Dont you need three A squares	This one	sd	1
Dont look at that bottom part	Oh	b	1
What does that look like	IStudentt it She says that like Didnt you do it this way	sd	1
No	Thats what	sd	1
What whats being cubed here	Three	sd	4
Whats being cubed here	Oh	b	1
Whats in the parentheses	Three twos	sd	4
So write three A twos for me	Three A twos	sd	4
Three A twos	Oh	b	1
Cause iStudentt that dont you have A squared three times	Oh I get it	sd	1
Write three A twos out	Three A twos	sd	1
IStudentt this A two A squared times A squared times A squared	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	So this is wrong	sd	1
So this is wrong	You have A squared A squared like that	sd	4
Now can you break those down further	So its A six	sd	4
You guys okay with the same logic and see if you see a pattern	Okay Mrs Scott	sd	1
Yes	Its A to the sixth power	sd	4
Its A to the sixth power	I dont understand that	sd	3
I dont understand that	I dont	sd	1
How many As is it	Three	sd	4
So write A times A times A	Okay	b	1
So what do you write	Another	sd	1
Another	Where did you get another	sd	3
Thats right	Oh	b	1
Break it out	Oh we have to keep going	sd	1
Oh we have to keep going	So we cant just stop right there	sd	1
So how many As do you have	Well how what about the two	sd	3
Well how what about the two	Where did we get the two from	sd	3
A to the three	Yeah	b	1
So A three times A three is that	Oh twice	ba	4
Oh twice	Huh	b	3
Okay	Do we really have to break them down the whole way	sd	1
Lets go	Yeah	b	1
I just want to know what the answer to number four is	A to the sixth	sd	4
Now what did you get over here Phoebe for number five	A to the sixth	sd	4
And Roberts group what did you get for number six	A to the eighth	sd	4
Did someone find a rule	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
Chris what did you find out	A to the M times N or A to the MN	sd	4
When we have an exponent within parentheses raised to an exponent we get A to the what	A to the M times N or A to the MN	sd	4
Then well let them know cause Ive I already got	MiStudents	sd	1
MiStudents	And then A five times A five	sd	4
And then A five times A five	And then A four times A four	sd	2
Okay	You just put the exponent after the number	sd	4
Okay	So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	sd	5
So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	Right	b	1
Write that down what you said you think it is	What	ba	3
Right	A A A times B B B	sd	4
So you asked me is it the same as what	A B	sd	4
A B	Okay	b	1
Okay	So it would be A B times A B times A B	sd	4
So it would be A B times A B times A B	Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	sd	1
Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	How do you combine it	qy	3
Okay	Those arent the same	sd	4
How many As do I have	Three and three	sd	4
It is	No	b	1
That says to me A times B times B times B	A three B three	sd	4
Cause this is when you asked me	Right	b	1
Right	I told you	aa	1
Yes	So this would be right and	sd	1
Try to develop your rule if you can too with your group	How do you keep You just combine them	sv	4
How do you keep You just combine them	Right	b	1
Is that the problem I gave you	No	b	1
I dont see you writing this out in expanded form	All right	aa	1
Yes	Am I doing this right	sd	1
Yes	Oh	b	1
Oh	MiStudents	sd	1
Yes	I told you brat	sd	1
I told you brat	I dont understand the next step	sd	3
I dont understand the next step	Okay	b	1
Okay	So far I  A times B so thatd be A B	sd	4
Okay	And then its times three	sd	4
Yeah	So A times A B A B A B	sd	4
So A times A B A B A B	What do I do next	sd	3
So how many As do you have	Three As and three Bs	sd	4
Three As and three Bs	Three As	sd	2
Three As	And three Bs	sd	2
That says one A and three Bs	Is this right	aa	1
Is this right	Oh	b	1
Oh	One A and three Bs	sd	4
A to the one times B to the three	Thats not what I have	sd	4
Thats not what I have	I have this	sd	4
I have this	Oh what	ba	3
Oh what	Is it A cubed	sd	4
Is it A cubed	Well would it be like	sd	1
How many As do you have	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
So whats whats	A	b	4
A	A cubed times	sd	2
A cubed times	A cubed times A cubed	sd	2
A cubed times A cubed	And thats thats	sd	1
And thats thats	So then I was right	sd	1
Yeah	Oh	b	1
Oh	So A B times to the third iStudentt right	sd	4
So A B times to the third iStudentt right	Would it be  or would it be times that	sd	3
Would it be  or would it be times that	Is that right Ms Scott	sd	1
Thats thats fine	A cubed times B cubed	sd	4
Uhhuh	So A cubed times	sd	4
Cant it	Sure	b	1
Yes Phoebe	Okay	b	1
Okay	I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	sd	5
I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	and then other times youd put it B times B times B	sd	5
How many As do you have	A or A cubed	sd	4
Times what	Times B cubed	sd	4
Times B cubed	So would that be the answer or would I put A B cubed	sd	3
Write A B cubed for me	Five times and then times B times B times B	sd	4
How many As is that	Three	sd	4
Wheres the three on the A	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	So youd have to put A cubed plus B cubed	sd	4
Are we did I tell you to plus	No	b	1
What are we doing	Times	sd	4
Times	Multiplying	sd	2
And what other way	And the little dot thing	sd	4
And what other way	Times the X	sd	4
Times the X	The X	sd	2
And what other way	I dont know	sd	1
Well if I write A B what does that mean	A times B	sd	4
So you can just have them next to each other right	Yeah	b	1
And that still means multiplication	And then would I put like A B cubed or A cubed and B cubed	sd	3
Yep	What	ba	3
What	A cubed and B cubed	sd	3
A cubed and B cubed	Is that what I would do	sd	1
Uhhuh	Like	sd	1
Like	I mean B cubed	sd	4
I mean B cubed	Is that what I would put	sd	1
Uhhuh	Thats the answer	sd	4
Thats the answer	Thats how I would get it	sd	1
See the other ones	So we put it in parentheses	sd	4
So we put it in parentheses	Oh that doeStudentt help	sd	1
Robert how would we rewrite that	A B Cubed	aa	4
And on eight Courtney the quantity A B to the fifth power	A to the fifth times B to the fifth	sd	4
A B	Its A to the fourth and B to the fourth	sd	4
Did someone find the rule	We did	sd	1
Blake	Its A to M times B to M	sd	4
One right	One yeah	b	1
Right	So	b	1
So	So	b	1
So	What do we do with the one	sd	3
Okay	Multiply it	sd	4
Right	Thats all you write	sd	1
This is saying I have four over two how many times	Three	sd	4
So how many fours do I have	Three	sd	4
And how many twos do I have	Three	sd	4
Three	Oh thats pretty easy	ba	1
Okay	Thats all we have to do	sd	1
Section four problems 10 through 12	Oh my gosh	sd	1
Oh my gosh	I feel so stupid	sd	1
I feel so stupid	How does this one look	sd	1
How does this one look	For section	sd	1
Thats wrong	IStudentt it A	sd	4
And he wrote three	Oh	b	1
Oh	I wrote three too	sd	2
So how many As would be left	Three	sd	2
Three	Three cause right there	sd	2
Three cause right there	One two three	sd	2
Yeah	Three	sd	4
Three	Yeah cause theres three	sd	2
See if you come up with a rule on that one	A to the fourth power	sd	4
A to the fourth power	How do we do  like that	sd	1
How do we do  like that	I dont understand how to do that one	sd	3
So write out A six As	Okay	b	1
Okay	This is Cynthia	sd	1
This is Cynthia	Uhhuh	b	1
Uhhuh	Did you get A to third	sd	1
Did you get A to third	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	Right	b	1
And whats it being divided by	A to the second	sd	4
Okay	So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	sd	4
So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	So its two A squared	sd	4
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	A fourth	sd	2
A fourth	A fourth	sd	2
A fourth	So then its just A to the fourth	sd	2
So then its just A to the fourth	He was the smart one	sd	1
And A times	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay I got it	sd	1
Yes	Would you add these together the four and the four	sd	4
Whats the denominator	Oh	sd	1
How many As are supposed to be down there	Okay	b	1
Okay	Is this right MiStudents Scott	sd	1
Is this right MiStudents Scott	Did you do A to the sixth and A to the	sd	1
Okay	Is this A to the fourth	sd	1
Whats left here	I still dont get how its down by four	sd	3
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	Oh I got the rule now	sd	1
Oh I got the rule now	Okay	b	1
You get Does that make sense to you	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	MiStudents Scott is this right	sd	1
MiStudents Scott is this right	Did you get A to the sixth on top and then A	sd	4
Yep	And then	sd	1
Yep	Does the answer equal A to the	sd	4
Does the answer equal A to the	And this ones A	sd	4
And this ones A	Right	b	1
Right	Cause	b	1
Lets look at problem	You just add them	sd	4
You just add them	You just add them	sd	2
Dominic what did you get for the answer to problem number 10	A to the fourth	sd	4
Sam on number 11 what answer did you get	A to the third	sd	4
Chelsea what did you get	A	b	4
Lucia	A to the M minus N	sd	4
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
So go ahead and do 13 through 15 quickly	Oh	b	1
Yes	I need help	sd	1
I need help	How do you get it	qy	1
How do you get it	Oh yes I do	aa	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	So first you expand it out right	sd	4
So first you expand it out right	You get A times A times A over B times B times B	sd	5
You get A times A times A over B times B times B	So wouldnt it equal A over B	sd	5
So wouldnt it equal A over B	I dont know	sd	1
Well how many As do you have	Three	sd	4
So how do you write that	Oh so it wouldnt be A cubed over B cubed	sd	4
Try the next one and see if you see a pattern develop	A times	sd	4
A times	That was really really	sd	1
That was really really	B times B	sd	4
B times B	So now what would that equal	sd	3
So now what would that equal	Zero or would it just equal A	sd	3
Zero or would it just equal A	Yeah	b	1
Yes	MiStudents Scott am I doing this right	sd	1
MiStudents Scott am I doing this right	MiStudents Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	sd	3
MiStudents Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	Cause they all	sd	1
Okay	To three	sd	4
To three	Three	sd	2
So its A over	Third	sd	4
Third	So itd be right	aa	1
Okay	But those both canc the thirds cancel out so itd just be A over B	sd	5
They do	Couldnt it be one	sd	4
How do you know that	I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	sd	5
I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	Because	sd	1
But whats to the third power	But you dont know	sd	1
A	A and B	sd	4
A and B	So its still So theyre different	sd	4
So its still So theyre different	So its just A over B	sd	4
Are they like terms	Nnhnh	aa	1
So can we combine unlike terms	Nnhnh	aa	1
Right	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Okay	So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	sd	3
So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	Its A to the third B to the third	sd	4
Its A to the third B to the third	But MiStudents Scott did you say	sd	1
But MiStudents Scott did you say	Couldnt that still be A over B though	sd	4
Couldnt that still be A over B though	Ms Scott	sd	1
Yes Im listening Lucia	You said it was  like this is all one	sd	1
You said it was  like this is all one	Didnt you because	sd	1
So So how many As do you have	Three	sd	4
Three	Oh	b	1
What would I have	Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	sd	4
Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	Right	b	1
Right	Cause theyre both	sd	1
Whats A What Whats Whats A over A	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	It would still be	sd	1
It would still be	A over	sd	4
If I had three of those what would I have	Three	sd	4
Well whats one times one times one	A to the third	sd	4
A to the third	Oh	b	1
Oh	One yeah	b	2
One yeah	Three	sd	2
So if if the denominator was the same variable as the numerator yes we could simplify it	Mhhm	b	1
What is our answer Robert	A to the third over B to the third	sd	4
Number 14 Austin	A over the A to the five over B to the five	sd	4
And number 15 Rachelle	A to the sixth and B over B to the six	sd	4
Cristie	A M	sd	4
And I want you to prove that A to the negative N is equal to one over A to the N	This is math homework for tonight	sd	1
Youll present it to me tomorrow in claStudents	What if we dont know	sd	1
What if we dont know	Do we have to	sd	1
Do we have to	Are you serious	qy	1
So start working on that	All right	aa	1
Do you need me Robert	If A equals one over	sd	4
If A equals one over	I dont get that	sd	3
I dont get that	A equals zero is another one right	sd	4
A equals zero is another one right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So youre gonna keep plugging A in	sd	4
So youre gonna keep plugging A in	Oh no because lookit	sd	1
Oh no because lookit	A to the zero is A to the zero	sd	4
A to the zero is A to the zero	So if you dont	sd	1
So if you dont	If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	sd	5
If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	sd	3
Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	Yes	b	1
Yes	See yes were right	aa	1
See yes were right	Okay	b	1
Okay	I can do A minus  right	sd	4
Yes	You you have the question	sd	1
You you have the question	Okay no	b	1
Okay no	Okay well it would this be okay	sd	1
Okay well it would this be okay	You know zero times everything is zero right	sd	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	sd	4
But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	Like never mind	sd	1
Like never mind	Youre not making much sense	sd	1
Youre not making much sense	Never mind	sd	1
Never mind	Ryan made it sound better	sd	1
Ryan made it sound better	I always	sd	1
Work out some sample problems and see if you can come out and prove to me why A to the zero is one	A Because A is one	sd	5
Think about using those rules	That like just went right over my head	sd	4
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay guys	b	1
Okay guys	He says that A zero plus N equals one	sd	2
He says that A zero plus N equals one	Thats not right	aa	2
Thats not right	What	ba	3
What	IStudentt that zero not one	sd	4
A to the zero power equals one	Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	sd	4
Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	Wouldnt it be zero	sd	2
Wouldnt it be zero	UnleStudents you can	sd	1
UnleStudents you can	Because anything times zero is zero	sd	5
Because anything times zero is zero	Right	b	1
Right	But we have to prove to her why its one	sd	1
But we have to prove to her why its one	UnleStudents you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	sd	5
UnleStudents you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	Its not one though	sd	4
Its not one though	Reciprocolated it	sd	1
Reciprocolated it	Thatll still be zero	sd	4
Okay	I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	sd	5
I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	sd	1
Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	So then how could it be one	sd	3
So then how could it be one	Divide by zero	sd	4
What do we know about the rule of one	How are we gonna do these	sd	3
How are we gonna do these	A by negative	sd	4
You have a question	We never learned these	sd	1
We never learned these	The negative ones	sd	1
The negative ones	Remember	sd	1
Remember	We never learned these	sd	1
Yes	Hi	b	1
Hi	Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	sd	4
Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	Right	b	1
Right	So it would just be one	sd	4
What if A was a million	Huh	b	1
Huh	A million	sd	4
Lets say our A was equal to a million	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	Cause it would be equal to six	sd	4
Cause it would be equal to six	Huh	b	3
Huh	A million and one	sd	4
A million and one	Equals six	sd	4
Equals six	How do you	qy	1
And they So six to the zero power is one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And any	sd	1
And any	How	aa	3
How	Cause anything is one	sd	5
How	But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	sd	5
But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	Like if you had six times zero it says that youre not multiplying anything  zero	sd	5
But were dealing were dealing with powers now	Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	sd	1
Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	So itd be A times C	sd	4
So itd be A times C	Oh I know	sd	1
Oh I know	Cause its only one of these	sd	1
Cause its only one of these	Thats what I was trying to say	sd	1
Thats what I was trying to say	Is that it	sd	1
Is that it	Its only one A because there	sd	4
Youre getting youre on the right track	Cause its only one	sd	5
Cause its only one	Its not	sd	2
Start thinking about it in terms of multiplication and division now	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
Yes	I really dont get this	sd	3
I really dont get this	Instead of even if you you were like	sd	1
Instead of even if you you were like	Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	sd	5
Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	If it if like	sd	1
If it if like	Cause if  A were a number	sd	1
Cause if  A were a number	Cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero right	sd	5
That its being multiplied	It says A to the  power	sd	4
Does A to the zero mean A times zero	No	b	1
What does it mean	A would have to be one then right	sd	4
Cause I can tell you that a million to the zero power is one	Oh	b	1
Oh	So A times A times itself to	sd	4
Ten thousand to the zero power is one	What	ba	3
Start thinking about it	Cause these have to be A theyre A right	sd	5
Cause these have to be A theyre A right	Cause itll be one over	sd	5
Cause itll be one over	Itll just be	sd	1
Itll just be	The first one were having a hard time understanding	sd	3
Now think about what you can use over there between your multiplication and your division rules and prove to me that A to the zero is one	Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	sd	1
Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	Well what did what did you do	sd	1
Lets see	We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	sd	5
We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	Cause then	sd	1
Using your rules up there	Oh okay	b	1
How am I gonna get that zero power and itll start making sense to you	Okay	b	1
Okay	Cause he kept saying this is impoStudentsible cause wouldnt it be zero equals A	sd	2
And how did you do that	I multiplied two by itself	sd	4
So here this is not saying A times zero this is say A to the zero power	Told you	aa	1
A to the zero power	That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	sd	5
That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	So that would be one right	sd	5
What if A was equal to 1000	Then itd be A to I dont know	sd	4
No cause a thousand to the zero power is	Is	b	1
What can I do mathematically to get A to zero power	Mathematically A to the zero power	sd	4
Mhhm	Oh you plus plus N	sd	4
Oh you plus plus N	Can we use the calculator	sd	1
Yeah you could use a calculator	Okay	b	1
You could use a calculator	Okay	b	1
Okay	So so the second	sd	1
Put in 1000 to the zero power	Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	sd	5
Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	So it would be one right	sd	4
So it would be one right	Or you just get it	sd	1
Or you just get it	How do you get zero equals one	sd	3
Okay	Okay I dont get it	sd	3
Okay	Maybe you divide it by one or something so that would be	sv	4
Look at your rules of exponents up there and where do you think you can get a negative N	Oh A times M over A times N equals A M minus N	sd	4
So therefore M would have to be larger than N Right	Yeah	b	1
Think about it	We dont understand this	sd	3
Now Ryan I figured youd have this solved in no time	I I I cant work with them	sd	1
I I I cant work with them	Work with us	sd	1
Work with us	Its weird	sd	1
Its weird	We dont under	sd	1
We dont under	I remember learning this a long time ago	sd	1
I remember learning this a long time ago	Like it was one of those questions	sd	1
Like it was one of those questions	It was like one of those brain stumpers	sd	1
It was like one of those brain stumpers	Yeah	b	1
Right	And we can divide	sd	4
And we can divide	Yeah	b	2
What kind of problem could you give me	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	A multiplication problem	sd	4
With exponents	With exponents	sd	1
With exponents	With exponents	sd	1
With exponents	A to the one	sd	4
A to the one	Yeah	b	2
A to the one and then what would I have to do to A to the one so that it becomes A to the zero	Divide it	sd	4
Divide it	Minus it	sd	2
By one or by	Zero	sd	4
Now since were doing division what does the rules of exponents say	Oh you have to minus right	sd	4
So it says that what youre going to do to get this and we want this put this equal A to the zero	To equal	aa	4
What whats whats one of the rules	You have to minus minus	sd	4
You have to minus minus	You subtract the	sd	2
You subtract the top exponent from the bottom	Yes	b	1
So how am I going to what am I gonna put down here such that this would be zero when Im done	One A	sd	4
One A	A to the one	sd	2
A to the one	Okay	b	4
Now is A to the one over A to the one equal to A to the zero	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
By your rules what do you do	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You subtract	sd	4
You subtract	Cause you subtract	sd	2
Now what do you know about math when a number is over itself	They cancel out	sd	4
And what does it equal	Zero	sd	4
And whats that equal to	Zero	sd	4
What does that say	A to the zero	sd	4
Now didnt you just prove it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So how do you write that out	sd	3
So how do you write that out	Oh	b	1
Oh	I	b	1
I	Can we just show that	sd	1
Can we just show that	All right	aa	1
All right	Thats it	ba	1
Thats it	Thats real easy	sd	1
Okay	All right	aa	1
All right	Okay	b	1
Now was it as hard as you thought	Yep	b	1
Yep	Sure	b	1
Okay	Do we have homework tonight	sd	1
You have homework tonight	Oh	b	1
See ya	The first one	sd	1
The first one	Bye Mrs Scott	sd	1
Bye Mrs Scott	I love you	sd	1
I love you	Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	sd	1
Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	We think youre the bomb	sv	1
And  Samuel	The empty spaces or boxes	sd	4
Osi where do you see the 9	All of them	sd	4
Claire	In simplest form	sd	4
Whats your	There are two empty columns and three columns together	sd	4
Can you say that  tell me what she was saying about the the 2 and the 3	Theres 3 columns	sd	4
3 columns	And two of them have been eaten so that makes the fraction which is eaten 23	sd	5
Kevin could you read this for us	Anthony makes candy	sd	1
Nice and loud	First he mixes 1 cup of cream with 2 cups of chocolate	sd	1
First he mixes 1 cup of cream with 2 cups of chocolate	In all he uses 9 cups of the two ingrdients	sd	1
Ingredients	Ingredients	sd	1
Yeah	How many cups of chocolate does he use in his candy recipe	sd	1
I see some private thumbs  and when you and your partner are both ready go ahead and you may share	So he thinks each one is 9 cups he forgot the  in all	sd	2
So he thinks each one is 9 cups he forgot the  in all	Yeah he didnt write the	sd	2
Yeah he didnt write the	Yeah he saw it	sd	2
Yeah he saw it	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Because he thinks every cup is 9 cups but he forgot the  in all	sd	2
Because he thinks every cup is 9 cups but he forgot the  in all	So he used 3 cups in one ingredient and then to make it 9 cups he had to add that ingredient 2 more times	sd	2
So he used 3 cups in one ingredient and then to make it 9 cups he had to add that ingredient 2 more times	So it makes 3  3  3 which equals 9	sd	5
What do you think	I think the problem is long and he misunderstood the question I think he only thought that it was both cups combined	sd	2
Really loud I can barely hear you	Hes wrong because he thought both the chocolate and the cream were 9 cups which means in all it had 18 cups	sd	5
Hes wrong because he thought both the chocolate and the cream were 9 cups which means in all it had 18 cups	But the question said that in all they had 9 cups only	sd	5
Im kind of curious  what helps you remember Sarah	Uh that two thirds is larger	sd	4
Erik	I remember that two wait three fourths is larger than two  thirds by one twelfth or two twentyfourths	sd	5
Michael what do you  remember	I agree with Erik um because thats I remember three  fourths being bigger than it because the four wait I had three  light greens and then only two purples and the three light  greens were larger	sd	5
Meredith	Ok what do we need	sd	3
Ok what do we need	We need the uh two oranges and the purple	sd	4
We need the uh two oranges and the purple	Yeah I remember two oranges and the purple	sd	2
Yeah I remember two oranges and the purple	This was our  last one because I remember I was tracing on it	sd	4
This was our  last one because I remember I was tracing on it	Oh yeah	b	2
Oh yeah	Two oranges one purple the browns I remember were the  thirds	sd	4
Two oranges one purple the browns I remember were the  thirds	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And the halves were the	sd	4
And the halves were the	We didnt need we didnt need halves remember	sd	4
We didnt need we didnt need halves remember	I know but we did build em	sd	2
I know but we did build em	I think it was the blacks or the dark greens	sd	4
I think it was the blacks or the dark greens	Dark greens fourthed it	sd	2
Dark greens fourthed it	Yeah	b	2
Put the mats under because its far too noisy	Yeah Erik have a mat its too noisy	sd	1
Yeah Erik have a mat its too noisy	Have a mat	sd	1
Have a mat	Ok one purple brown	sd	4
Ok one purple brown	Yeah try the purple the dark greens did fourth it	sd	4
Yeah try the purple the dark greens did fourth it	They did I know	sd	2
They did I know	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And then the twenty	sd	4
And then the twenty	No twelfths were the reds	sd	2
No twelfths were the reds	Twelfths were the reds and then the whites were the twenty fourths	sd	2
Twelfths were the reds and then the whites were the twenty fourths	Oh theyre copying us theyre doing twentyfourths	sd	2
Oh theyre copying us theyre doing twentyfourths	Somebodys copying	sd	2
Somebodys copying	Oh crap we dont have any more reds	sd	1
Oh crap we dont have any more reds	Seven we have eight  nine ten we just need two more	sd	4
Seven we have eight  nine ten we just need two more	Can you spare two red rods	sd	1
Can you spare two red rods	Can we  have some	sd	1
Can we  have some	Here we go	sd	1
Here we go	Two three four five six	sd	1
Two three four five six	Do you have twentyfour twentyfourths	sd	1
Do you have twentyfour twentyfourths	Probably not	sd	1
Probably not	Oh I think you overdid it you overdid it	sd	2
Oh I think you overdid it you overdid it	What	ba	3
What	Well maybe not	sd	4
Well maybe not	What do you mean overdid it	sd	3
What do you mean overdid it	Well get out twentyfour ones	sd	1
Well get out twentyfour ones	I think we need twentyfour ones	sd	4
I think we need twentyfour ones	Mmm hmm	sd	2
Mmm hmm	One two three four five six seven Ill just take out as many  as possible	sd	1
While youre building this Id like you to  build the other model you also made	That was	sd	1
That was	Oh yeah the two browns remember	sd	4
Oh yeah the two browns remember	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	One brown two yeah it was the two	sd	4
One brown two yeah it was the two	One of those	sd	4
One of those	Yeah one	b	2
Yeah one	Something like that	sd	1
Try to remember  what	Yeah it was the two browns I think	sd	4
Why do you think it was the two browns	Because two browns you would be able to third it and fourth  it	sd	5
Because two browns you would be able to third it and fourth  it	So lets see	sd	1
So lets see	One two	sd	1
One two	Dont take any whites though	sd	1
Dont take any whites though	Because I need all the whites  possible	sd	1
Because I need all the whites  possible	I know	aa	1
We can get some more	Plus there are probably no whites left in there	sd	1
Plus there are probably no whites left in there	Lets see	aa	1
Lets see	There are two whites dont take any of them	sd	1
There are two whites dont take any of them	I need twenty four of em	sd	1
I need twenty four of em	Now we know that theres twenty four	sd	1
Ok build the other model and then when youre done call me  back	Twentyeight whites and one fifth	sd	4
Twentyeight whites and one fifth	I need the um	sd	1
I need the um	Yeah no	b	1
Yeah no	Give me two dark greens no three make it three um blacks  that might do it	sd	4
Give me two dark greens no three make it three um blacks  that might do it	Yeah three blacks thirded this	sd	4

Gentlemen gentlemen	Ok thats the second one	sd	1
Tell me what we have here	An orange and a red	sd	4
An orange and a red	And purples for thirds	sd	4
And purples for thirds	And three purples	sd	2
And three purples	And light green for fourths	sd	2
Ok right	And um here how I used to figure it out	sd	1
And um here how I used to figure it out	Twelfths	aa	4
Twelfths	Oh no those are singles	sd	4
Honestly Erik I could imagine if you explained to me what  Im supposed to imagine	Ok	b	1
Ill try real hard but I ll try to imagine	Suppose there are twelfths under that	sd	4
I can imagine that	And you took out two of those purples and three light greens	sd	4
I could imagine	It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between  the between the um um	sd	4
It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between  the between the um um	See	sd	1
See	Two thirds and three fourths	sd	4
I see that	And we came to up here	sd	1
And we came to up here	So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth   Fig 5 Erik And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it  would be bigger by one twelfth or	sd	5
So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth   Fig 5 Erik And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it  would be bigger by one twelfth or	Two twentyfourths	sd	5
Two twentyfourths	Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the	sd	5
Why is it a red here and why is it a white here	Well because see each model is different	sd	5
In what way	Because this model is bigger than this model	sd	5
Because this model is bigger than this model	You could put the reds on that model and make it  sixths	sd	4
You could put the reds on that model and make it  sixths	But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that  model	sd	3
But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that  model	Oh yeah youre right	aa	2
Oh yeah youre right	So either its one twelfth or one  twentyfourths	sd	4
So either its one twelfth or one  twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths	sd	2
Two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths on this one	sd	2
Two twentyfourths on this one	This is probably the only  model that can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd  have to halve each white to get twentyfourths there	sd	5
This is probably the only  model that can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd  have to halve each white to get twentyfourths there	But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	sd	3
But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	We tried that already	sd	1
We tried that already	No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	sd	2
You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three  oranges	Well I dont know exaT2ly but it would be a lot	sd	4
Do you still expeT2 that you would get the same answer	Well we can divide it	sd	4
Well we can divide it	Looking at this it would not be fiftieths	sd	4
Why not	Im imagining a this  instead of the  purple there	sd	4
Instead of the purple	It would take another six of those so it would only be  thirtieths	sd	5
Id like you to try that other model	Three oranges	sd	4
Id like you  to find a third model thinking big	Ok	b	1
Ok	We could think real big	sd	1
And see what you come up if you work on that	Dr Martino said the key is think big so	sd	1

Make three blues and train it	Then you could use those	sv	1
Then you could use those	What do you think I was thinking of	sv	1
What do you think I was thinking of	Give me my rods back	sd	1
Give me my rods back	Meredith can I have my rods	sd	1
Meredith can I have my rods	I brought them over	sd	1
I brought them over	Alan youre stealing from no no no Alan youre stealing  from us	sd	1
Alan youre stealing from no no no Alan youre stealing  from us	No	b	1
No	Oh oh	ba	1
Oh oh	Did you just take one of my blues	sd	1
Did you just take one of my blues	No	b	1
No	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And for the thirds the thirds can easily be done by the  blues	sd	4
And for the thirds the thirds can easily be done by the  blues	I have an idea	sd	1
I have an idea	Ive got a good idea	sd	1
Ive got a good idea	Ive got a better idea	sd	1
Ive got a better idea	The thirds and then how much room do we have left	sd	3
The thirds and then how much room do we have left	We  have one blue left which is nine	sd	4
We  have one blue left which is nine	One two three four five six  seven eight nine	sd	1
One two three four five six  seven eight nine	David Just listen out	sd	1
David Just listen out	Me need a brown rod	sd	1
Me need a brown rod	It all works out	sd	1
It all works out	You know what you could try	sd	1
You know what you could try	Use three blues and the light  green then use the oranges to third it then you could fourth it  easily	sd	5
Use three blues and the light  green then use the oranges to third it then you could fourth it  easily	Now	sd	1
Now	I already have a third	sd	4
I already have a third	See just put down the purple and I  took off the green	sd	4
See just put down the purple and I  took off the green	Here s what I made	sd	1
Here s what I made	Look it	sd	1
Look it	You have any blues	sd	1
You have any blues	Yeah but shes not going to give them to you	sd	1
Yeah but shes not going to give them to you	And the light green	sd	1

Easily your thirds can be used	PerfeT2 I did it	sd	1
PerfeT2 I did it	Hello Alan I did it	sd	1
Hello Alan I did it	You fourthed it too	sd	1
You fourthed it too	Yup	aa	1
Yup	One two three four	sd	1
Can you third that	I thirded it	sd	4
I thirded it	One two three and then plus nine other of those  which would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	5
One two three and then plus nine other of those  which would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	So its just like making a new rod	sd	5
So its just like making a new rod	Fourthing it might be	sd	4
Im not quite following that	Ok	b	1
Ok	I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones  which would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would  add one to there one to there and one to there which would  be three	sd	5
I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones  which would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would  add one to there one to there and one to there which would  be three	And then four five six seven eight nine	sd	5
And then four five six seven eight nine	So its like  adding another blue but Im making a new rod	sd	5
Ok can you set that up in a different way	Well in thirds	sd	4
Use the same pieces but can you set it up a little differently	Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the  three next to that and the three next to that	sd	5
Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the  three next to that and the three next to that	Huh	b	3
Huh	Ill show you what I mean	sd	1
Its running	please turn off the air	sd	1
Okay	go out to my locker and get my maths book	sd	1
Oh you wont need it today	Oh okay	b	1
Are you going to be sitting down	I havent	sd	1
Oh then youve got to go outside then	books	sd	1
Theyre not supposed to be coming in here	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	What	sd	1
But um Theyll have to	Oh okay so what should we do	sd	1
Can someone give me a word or two that you need	Convex	b	4
Some others words or phrases	Exterior angle	sd	4
Were there any others	Rays	aa	4
Can anyone help us with what a polygon might be	Its a fivesided shape	sd	4
Hmm not a lot	Any twoD shape	sd	4
So would that be a polygon	Any twoD shape which is enclosed	sd	4
Mm oh thats enclosed	Mm a manysided shape	sd	4
Manysided shape	Straight	b	4
Peter	Um an exterior angle lies outside the polygon	sd	1
What does the first sentence underneath the heading say	Um exterior angle  polygon  is formed when of the sides is extended	sd	1
And it does lie outside the original polygon does it	Yes	b	1
And then	Um start from one point and then go  create a ray	sd	5
Um start from one point and then go  create a ray	And then somewhere along that ray draw another one across	sd	5
Now think carefully about that	You go to the point	sd	4
Now what havent we explained yet	Convex	b	4
Convex	Convex	b	2
Anyone know theres a word thats the opposite of convex	Oh	b	1
Oh	Doesnt convex mean its like um when you have glasses theres uh  convex lens is the one which is curved	sd	4
Thats the key thing	Outside	sd	4
Outside	Inside	aa	2
Inside	Outside	sd	2
The the other word that means the opposite of that also starts with that	Concave	sd	4
Whats that sort of thing called that youve just written down	Conjecture	b	4
Uh so if youd like to do that	the chair	sd	1
the chair	No	b	1
No	Give me the chair	sd	1
Give me the chair	Thats so unfair Give me the chair	sd	1
Notice Ive fixed up	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thank you	aa	1
Well theres a pentagon already	How come	sd	1
You can make it a bit bigger but uh it should click on to that last	Oh look at	sd	1
No thats not joined on	Okay now	sd	1
So now we can measure the angle	Okay	b	1
Okay now do the same for that one	Measure the angles	sd	4
And then you can then you can have that angle plus that angle plus	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thank you	aa	1
So youve just got to select the point tool and click somewhere out there	Okay	b	1
Okay	Now we need to put  on this	sd	1
Thats good	That one	sd	1
That one	No you did that one first	sd	1
I think you might need the select tool	Do you just measure the exterior or the inside ones as well	sd	4
Remember click somewhere to get rid of the other selection and then go that that that Do you remember how to measure the angles	Yeah	b	1
What about if you make it concave	It does but	sd	1
Point two	its weird if you move these two it seems to	sd	1
A B C D E A B C Youve got angle D H D which is yeah cause youve actually measured angle D H E which is that angle over there	Thats cause we drew the middle one in first	sd	5
Thats cause we drew the middle one in first	Oh	b	1
But itll mean you have to change your formula as well	Its easier to understand sir it came out for us	sd	1
Its easier to understand sir it came out for us	Um how did you do it the other day when you just clicked one of the things and it	sd	3
Now when you go to calculate you can say	Oh	b	1
That angle plus the second one plus and so on	Oh I didnt do that	sd	1
Oh I didnt do that	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	I just pressed the thingy	sd	1
Excellent idea	Does it matter if it goes through the rays	sd	1
Youve got one with Jack	Oh we missed that one	sd	1
Oh triangles too	Yep	b	1
Okay	Sir	sd	1
Well which polygons have you tried so far	Um	b	1
Youve only tried a pentagon	Okay	b	1
Um what did you do there	The sides	sd	4
Well can you do it again	Um	sd	1
The top of it is slightly off the screen because you havent got your um your thing	How  down	sd	1
Now you going to write something about it then	Yeah	b	1
Do you know how to do that	Mr  when it says um this is  try one	sd	1
Now your conclusion says when you move the parts of the pentagon the sum of the angles does not change	Exterior angles	sd	4
And one other one other fairly important fact that you could mention but just think about it	We havent finished it yet	sd	1
We havent finished it yet	We havent finished it yet because we  change it um we have to summarize what a pentagon is	sd	1
Okay but just think about when you say it does not change what doesnt it change from	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	How do I make a text box	sd	1
Is that what it says	Yeah	b	1
In fact what would you really call it	Interior	b	4
Are all the other ones the same	Yeah they all look like that too	sd	4
It will actually build it up for you like so	Oh thanks	ba	1
Oh thanks	How do you do a degree sign	sd	1
Maybe that looks like a degree sign	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	I also have another question	sd	3
I also have another question	If these three have to go go into a new sketch and make other	sd	3
Theyre talking about ones	Okay	b	1
So	But we dont	sd	1
But we dont	Um Mr Brown	sd	1
Um Mr Brown	Do we have to go on to do Do we have to go on to do	sd	1
Yes the sum of the exterior angles are the same for any convex polygon which is 360 degrees	Is that right	aa	1
And then say and discuss the change if you change the uh polygon	Okay	b	1
Okay	Do we have to go	sd	1
When youre choosing a name for it try and choose a name that actually means something	Mr Brown when we use the computer calculator we got 360 and when we did it on my calculator got to 359	sd	4
Are you all as awake as I am	Yeah	b	1
Did you all build the same model	No	b	1
To answer that question	No no	ba	1
Erik	Some of us built the same models and some of us built different	sd	4
Erik	Could you get different answers	sd	4
Could you get different answers	Using barred models	sd	2
Using barred models	if you use different models	sd	4
Maybe not huh Michael have you been thinking about that a little  bit	Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that we  got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth because it  will always take two it will always take four quarters to equal up	sd	5
Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that we  got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth because it  will always take two it will always take four quarters to equal up	Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it by two	sd	5
Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it by two	In half	sd	2
In half	So there will always be one fourth and two fourths three fourths  four fourths and two fourths is always going to be a half halfway  point	sd	5
What are you why  are you smiling about Mark	Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	sd	1
Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	I made the sea monster  bigger than the boat	sd	4
Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat	No	b	1
What about the boat and the children	Those too	sd	1
Those too	The children are bigger	sd	4
No	Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of just the  boat	sd	2
Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of just the  boat	Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look bigger like  youre looking at the children not the boat	sd	2
Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look bigger like  youre looking at the children not the boat	like he doesnt he just put the boat in	sd	2
Yeah	Cause theyre at the dock	sd	2
Cause theyre at the dock	Yeah but he wasnt just focusing on the  boat	sd	2
What  would you expect if you were really worrying about the size you  had two children at a dock and you have a boat and you have a fish  now we re not going to go with sea monsters	Uh the boats the biggest	sd	4
Do you agree	Mm hmm	sd	2
okay	And then the children um and then the fish	sd	4
You all agree with that	Um hmm	sd	2
Meredith	Well maybe not because everybody cant have the same because  they dont have theyre not like copying each other	sd	5
some of you might use little dolls or  something right or bigger dolls or	You re not measuring the same	sd	4
And if somebody came in now with a fish bigger than the boy   that would have missed the point right	No because a fish could be bigger than a boy	sd	5
Would it look different	Yes	b	1
Would the relationships that youre suppose to show change	No	b	1
No	It would look like a shrimp	sd	4
Graham	Well it wouldnt fit	sd	4
And what would happen  Meredith	Well you could put the Audras fish and you could put Danielles fish  into Audras box because it s small and it could fit in	sd	5
It could be a shrimp	but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small	sd	5
So in this case if if your one is going to be the size of this  little stage if you like  your players are made the boy the  girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it	Mm hmm	sd	1
Isnt that  right	Yup	aa	1
Would you expect it to work if your	Maybe maybe	sd	1
So tell me what  you re thinking	Well your old model say your old model you decided it was too  little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	sv	5
Well your old model say your old model you decided it was too  little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	So you make a bigger  model and you try to take the little fish from that model because you  decide that you dont want to make another one you put it in and you  wouldnt be able to see it there	sv	5
Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a different  model that her fish was smaller than the people and smaller than the  boat	Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish	sd	4
But should those relationships hold	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	1
Yeah is that right	Yeah	b	1
Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he were  trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be smaller than  the people than the boat	Yeah	b	1
So in each of your models would have those relationships holding  right	Yeah	b	1
But they wouldnt all be built the same way and they wouldnt all be  the same size	So it d be its standard that the fish would be smaller than the boat  and the people except the fish would be different sized and the  people different sized and the boat different sized	sd	5
Is that like what youre doing when you make models to  compare fractions	Yeah	b	1
Meredith	Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right then  youre going to wind up with the same answer and some of the  models could be bigger and some of them could be smaller	sd	5
Michael do you want to add to that	Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller than the  people and the people have to be smaller than the boat cause the  people have to go in the boat and the people have to be able to pull  the fish out of the water and if it was bigger than it they might have a  little trouble getting it out	sd	5
Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller than the  people and the people have to be smaller than the boat cause the  people have to go in the boat and the people have to be able to pull  the fish out of the water and if it was bigger than it they might have a  little trouble getting it out	So um so then um its sort of  like so that just helps us understand what we re talking about with  the Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to make  different sized um halves and quarters um but they re basically  you can call it the same thing as you would then just the small one  with the small one if you call the box a whole and the boat a half it  would equal a quarter	sd	5
So um so then um its sort of  like so that just helps us understand what we re talking about with  the Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to make  different sized um halves and quarters um but they re basically  you can call it the same thing as you would then just the small one  with the small one if you call the box a whole and the boat a half it  would equal a quarter	You could still do that in Audras model or  any box	sd	5
Oh it was said already	Yes	b	1
Because you know I see thirteen things here	I dont think they know how to count	sd	1
I dont think they know how to count	I think Meredith sabotaged it	sd	1
I think Meredith sabotaged it	Well I think I think yesterday maybe it was three blues	sd	4
Well I think I think yesterday maybe it was three blues	No it was smaller	sd	2
It looks pretty well lets get it  this is the model you guys just had  right	No we had one that was straighter	sd	1
Okay now these are all even but I see yeah there s  thirteen arent there	We dont need twelfths	sd	4
We dont need twelfths	Thats the whole point	sd	4
Thats the whole point	Whats the point of twelfths	sd	3
Whats the point of twelfths	The point is two thirds and three  fourths	sd	4
The point is two thirds and three  fourths	The answer is one twelfth	sd	4
The answer is one twelfth	Meredith I made this thing to show that when you double it	sd	1
Meredith I made this thing to show that when you double it	To  show that when you double it	sd	1
To  show that when you double it	The reds were one twelfths now the  reds aren t one twelfths now the reds are uh	sd	4
The reds were one twelfths now the  reds aren t one twelfths now the reds are uh	So youre trying to show that with different models thirds that  theyre twelfths that if the numbers will change no theyre  changing size but they dont change in answer	sd	5
Why dont you tell me first and then if we  need to build a model we may have you come  up and do that	Well we have 1 divided by 16 equals 6	sd	5
I want somebody to come up and  tell me about this now about how this  describes this sentence	They had one I dont know if they want to do  it	sd	1
If this works how does it work	It works because division you see how many  times you can get a number into a number	sd	5
It works because division you see how many  times you can get a number into a number	So you can get 16 umm you can get 6 times  you can get 16 into 1 with no remainders	sd	5
So you can get 16 umm you can get 6 times  you can get 16 into 1 with no remainders	So that would leave that that would be 6	sd	5
So youre saying then that 16	You can have 6 of them	sd	4
It goes into 1 if you were lining them up	6 times	sd	4
Does that make sense	How can 6 go into 1 six times	sd	3
How can 6 go into 1 six times	1 whole but if youre dealing with numbers  it wouldnt make sense unless it was  negative	sd	5
1 whole but if youre dealing with numbers  it wouldnt make sense unless it was  negative	No I mean no 1 divided by 16 when you  ha you would get 6	sd	5
No I mean no 1 divided by 16 when you  ha you would get 6	I know but Im saying if you were taking like  6 and 1 you couldnt put 66s into 1	sd	5
I know but Im saying if you were taking like  6 and 1 you couldnt put 66s into 1	No I never said that	sd	2
Erik I dont think thats what Michael said  though	I know	aa	1
Youre  taking this to a challenge problem here I  think	Hes just trying to say that theres 66s is 1  whole	sd	2
What do you call this	One twelfth	sd	4
If I do one divided by one twelfth what do I  get	Um twelve	sd	4
Do you have twelve parts here	Um yeah	b	1
Tell me how youd write the number  sentence	I would write it 1 divided by 112 equals 12	sd	5
Are you ready	No	b	1
If you need to sharpen your pencil you better do that right this second	homework	sd	1
That was the only other thing that I asked you to do	I heard a couple of things	sd	1
I thought you were going to be the star of my show	Im definitely the star	sd	1
Suzy	If an angles inscribed in a circle and it intercepts part of the circle then the angles measure is equal to half of the other angle	sd	5
Matt	If an inscribed angle intercepts a semicircle then the angle is a right angle	sd	5
If it intercepts a semicircle then angle turns out to be	Right angle	b	4
And arc intercept corollary Margaret	When you have two inscribed angles and they intercept the same arc	sd	4
When they intercept the same arc then they have the same	Measure	aa	4
Whatd you come up with	Ninety degrees	sd	4
Why do you say 90 degrees	Because it says that secant and tangent angle is a right angle and it	sd	5
So and the measure of a semicircle here arc A V is what	A hundred and eighty degrees	sd	4
Whats that	The right angle corollary	sd	4
Leah	Because its the central angle and the central and the arc that they intercept equals the measure	sd	5
Go ahead	Triangle A P V is isosceles so angle three and angle two have to be congruent	sd	5
Okay	And since all angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees you take 180	sd	5
And since all angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees you take 180	You subtract 120 and you divide them into 65	sd	5
Youre on a roll lets go	Yeah P V C has to be a right angle because it intercepts V C	sd	5
They say radius to that tangent we learned that	Oh yeah	b	1
Go ahead	If A V C is 90 degrees and angle two is 30 degrees	sd	4
This kind of this being 60 degrees how does that relate to back here the arc	Half	sd	4
So the measure of an acute secant tangent angle with its vertex on the circle is	Half	sd	4
What do you think this general statement here measure of arc A V if its X whats angle one gonna be	X	b	4
Suzy	You first have to do 180 minus X  and then you divide it by two	sd	5
Divide it by two	Then theyll be the same as three	sd	4
Thats going to be	Ninety degrees	sd	4
And so the last here this angle is going to be what	Half of the arc	sd	4
Which is	Half X	aa	4
Melissa	Full circle has to equal 360 degrees take away the 200	sd	4
How do you get that one	Um the triangle	sd	4
Triangle um	Serum theorem	aa	4
Serum theorem	It has to be equal to 180	sd	4
Okay	If angle one is already 160 then angle two and angle three are equal	sd	5
Anything different about that one than the other example	No	b	1
If youre following a pattern what are you getting	Half	sd	4
Its gonna be	Half	sd	4
For measure of angle A V C how would you relate that back to X for any for any measure	X over two	sd	4
How would you figure out angle one if you know X for A X V	Three sixty minus X	sd	4
And Katie how would you do that last one that angle two	Angle two would be	sd	1
This ones a little bit tricky	The 180 thing works like I know how to explain it Im not sure exactly what the equation is but I could do it	sd	4
Okay	Like I	sd	1
So tell me what to do and well try to put it in X for you	All right	aa	1
All right	You have to get the measure of angle A P V	sd	4
Okay	And then	sd	1
Thats 360 minus X	Yeah	b	1
Okay	And then you would take the other two since its an isosceles triangle and	sd	5
And then you would take the other two since its an isosceles triangle and	have to be equal so you have divide whatever the original angle is	sd	5
have to be equal so you have divide whatever the original angle is	Like it I dont know	sd	1
Like it I dont know	Im sorry	sd	1
Im sorry	You subtract A P V from 180 and then divide it by two	sd	4
You subtract A P V from 180 and then divide it by two	Thats what I would do anyway	sd	1
Its always gonna come up to be	Half	sd	4
Leah	Arc A C equals 160 and angle one is an inscribed angle so its half of A C	sd	5
Good	And since A C is 160 half is 80	sd	5
Melissa	B D is 40  so angle of that so its half	sd	5
Where could they have gotten that 100 degrees	Theres two ways you can get it	sd	4
Theres two ways you can get it	The first way is to add the measures of angle one and angle two together	sd	5
The first way is to add the measures of angle one and angle two together	And the second way is to add the measure of the two arcs together and divide it by two	sd	5
Or do you want to just do the next row and see what we come up with	Yeah	b	1
If A C is 180 what does that angle one have to be	Ninety	sd	4
Inscribed angle	Thirtyfive	b	4
What would that give us	One twentyfive	sd	4
If we do 180 plus 70 what does that give us	Two fifty	sd	4
Two fifty	Divide that	sd	4
Divide that in half you get	One twentyfive	sd	4
What do you think	First angle is half the A C	sd	4
What Matt says	That for measure of angle one has to be half of the arc A C	sd	4
How about measure of angle two has to be half of	B D	sd	4
Katie	What if you added the two angles together at the top and that was whatever that is if its the triangle	sd	5
What if you added the two angles together at the top and that was whatever that is if its the triangle	You get that other measure and then its an 80 degree thing	sd	5
You get that other measure and then its an 80 degree thing	See if you subtract that from 180	sd	5
See if you subtract that from 180	Like	sd	1
Say that again	And then its on the 180 degrees line cause thats where the line is	sd	5
Okay	All right	aa	1
All right	That you add the two angles at the top and subtract that from one that from 180 because it makes a triangle	sd	5
That you add the two angles at the top and subtract that from one that from 180 because it makes a triangle	So you subtract that from 180 and that gives you what the other angle is	sd	5
Youre talking about A V C or D V B	A V C The first one	sd	4
A V C The first one	And it works for the other one too	sd	4
Is that a lot to do for a general rule	Maybe but it works	sd	4
So now we have maybe three different ways to find it	But that actually that actually proves that what Michaela said works	sd	2
But that actually that actually proves that what Michaela said works	Cause	sd	1
She did two	Both of them	sd	4
Both of them	Well both of them	sd	2
It proves that both of them work	Both of them got the same thing	sd	2
Both of them got the same thing	Both of them got the same answer as the other one that Katie just said and that really proves it	sd	2
The 125 and the 100 that we already went over	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Because basically just adding angle one and angle two together is simplifying adding A C and B D B D together and divide it by two	sd	5
Because basically just adding angle one and angle two together is simplifying adding A C and B D B D together and divide it by two	Cause if you do 180	qy	1
Okay	You do 180 minus 125 you get 55	sv	5
You do 180 minus 125 you get 55	Well then if you do 180 minus 55 you get 125 again	sv	5
Okay	Its longer but it proves it	sd	4
We have three different ways which one would fit into there	Half the sum of the two arcs	sd	4
Melissa	intercepted arc of for angle of B D has to be half	sd	4
Go ahead	The same reason as for measured angle	sd	4
Ben	You can do first you gotta do 180 minus one and that gives you the measure of B C D	sd	5
You can do first you gotta do 180 minus one and that gives you the measure of B C D	And then you do that plus adding the two and then subtract that from 181 and then you have A V C	sd	5
So you were going with that whole large triangle	Yeah	b	1
That leaves you with 80	Eighty	sd	1
You have 80 you have measure of angle two which is	Twenty	sd	4
So that gives you 100 so that angle V A V C has to be	Eighty	sd	4
That works	Or you can do A C is the  outside the angle is outside the circle	sd	4
The arc	A V C	aa	4
Angle A V C	Its outside there but it intercepts A C The arc A C	sd	4
Okay	The arcs 40 degrees and since angle A V C is 80 maybe its 40 times times two	sd	5
No	It also intercepts arc B D	sd	4
Okay	But if you do B D which equals 200 plus A C  240	sd	5
But if you do B D which equals 200 plus A C  240	At no wait	sd	1
At no wait	Do 200 minus 40 and then you get 160	sd	5
Okay	Divide that by two and that equals 80	sd	5
If youve been following this pattern of the angle it turns out to be	Half	sd	4
Okay	I see	b	1
Read that theorem for me and fill in the blanks	The measure of an angle formed by two secants that intersect the exterior of a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs	sd	1
The	Difference	sd	4
Were subtracting them this time	I thought I said that	sd	1
I was trying to see if Raul would get that	I thought that angle one was 100 degrees	sd	4
I thought that angle one was 100 degrees	Right	b	1
Okay	And then in order to find A B C you had oh yes	sd	3
How did you get your answer there	I used a theorem	sd	4
What did you do	I just used that theorem	sd	4
How did you use it	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	I did something	sd	1
You did something	All right	aa	1
Either way you do it you gotta show me what you did	Ms Lancour should we solve it	sd	1
You all did it the exact same way as Leah did it	Yep	b	1
That one was the nice one	I like nice ones	sd	1
Not me	Now I dont have to show my work	sd	1
The R S U	Yes	b	1
R S U looks like the vertex is on the circle	Yes	b	1
Raul what are you doing over here	Well I dont have any	sd	1
Which angle are you doing first	Well I dont I havent  problem but Im doing U T before  anything else	sd	1
Well I dont I havent  problem but Im doing U T before  anything else	Makes it simple for me	sd	1
Why is that	Cause then I feel like the question would be R S U	sd	5
Cause then I feel like the question would be R S U	Theres R S U Oh that would be half of that	sd	5
Theres R S U Oh that would be half of that	that	sd	1
Youre finding this arc first	Yeah this one first	sd	4
Howd you get this one Melissa	That it intercepts arc R U so it has to be half	sd	5
What did you do	Since the points on the circle I just divided the arc by two	sd	5
Because the R S U the point is on the circle	Yeah	b	1
So it has to be	Half of the arc	sd	4
Good	Where is	sd	1
Where are you Margaret	Right here	aa	1
You changing your mind	No	b	1
You got 110	Divide it in half	sd	4
Divide it in half	No	b	2
No	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	No	b	2
Yes	Maybe	sd	1
U S V U S V How did you get that one Leah	Cause R S U is half of 140 so its 70	sd	5
Cause R S U is half of 140 so its 70	And thats a line  equals 180	sd	4
And thats a line  equals 180	One eighty minus 70 equals 110	sd	5
Tell me what you just did again	This angle R S U is 70	sd	4
Okay	Thats half of that	ba	4
Okay	And this equals 180 so 180 minus 70 is 110	sd	5
At first at at first I thought you were doing the triangle	No	b	1
But you ended up doing 180 degrees	Cause the line equals	sd	5
Cause the line equals	Yeah	b	1
Margaret go for it	You do 140 degrees	aa	4
Okay	Minus 30 degrees and you get 110	sd	5
Minus 30 degrees and you get 110	So you divide that in half and get 55 degrees	sd	5
I had it one way in my mind and somebody else gave me a whole different way to think about it	I used the triangle sum theorem	sd	4
Okay	And we just did R V U so I know that that is 55 degrees	sd	5
Okay	And since S U V	sd	1
This one	I used the oh whats it called	sd	3
I used the oh whats it called	The arc intercept theorem	sd	4
Okay	To find out that that was 15	sd	4
So so far we have 55 and 15	I added them together and I got 70 so I did 180 minus	sd	5
It didnt even occur to me	Angle R S U we already figured that  70	sd	4
We did this RSU which was 70	Because if the R equals 140 and then R line segment R S V	sd	5
Okay	that line the the angle of it equals 180	sd	4
It has to be 180	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And so you do 180 minus 70	sd	5
And so you do 180 minus 70	You get 110	sd	5
And she got 110	Thats the easy way	sd	1
How would you get that one	Ninetyfive	sd	4
You say	Ninetyfive	sd	4
Ninetyfive	triangle sum again	sd	4
You did triangle sum	I did triangle sum	sd	4
I did triangle sum	I did was to figure out what arc U T equals	sd	4
I did was to figure out what arc U T equals	It equals 90	sd	4
It equals 90	You do 100 plus 90 divided by two	sd	5
Tomorrow	Tomorrow	aa	1
Tomorrow	Tomorrows the what	sd	1
But I dont know what went on	When when we came up with that thing that almost was like the Pascals Triangle	sd	4
When when we came up with that thing that almost was like the Pascals Triangle	What was it with e	sd	3
What was it with e	What were we doing	sd	3
What were we doing	It was um	sd	1
It was um	Ten ten percent of a hundred	sd	4
Ten ten percent of a hundred	Is that what it was	sd	2
Is that what it was	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Um Im not sure	sd	3
Um Im not sure	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Can we have a calculator	sd	1
Can we have a calculator	Are we allowed to have one	sd	1
You may want to have them around anyway	This could be our first time ever using calculators	sd	1
This could be our first time ever using calculators	Yeah	b	1
Wow first time	We usually	sd	1
You never use them	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	Are there any games on this	sd	1
Are there any games on this	We said one times or one minus	sd	4

Wasn t it like werent we doing this	Yeah thats what it was	sd	2
Yeah thats what it was	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Thats this	aa	2
Thats this	OK this is scary	sd	1
OK this is scary	Look when we were cause we were discussing like percentages	sd	2
Look when we were cause we were discussing like percentages	And uh like an increase and we did a hundred and we took ten percent of it and thats one two one thats one three three one and you know that is	sd	5
And uh like an increase and we did a hundred and we took ten percent of it and thats one two one thats one three three one and you know that is	Yeah we kept going it	sd	2
Yeah we kept going it	It doesnt come out yeah	sd	2
It doesnt come out yeah	After a while it goes	sd	2
After a while it goes	It kind of makes you think	sd	1
It kind of makes you think	After a while it stops but we were uh	sd	1
After a while it stops but we were uh	We really thought that was it look	sd	1
We really thought that was it look	We were into it	sd	1
So what does it mean	Uh we didnt we didnt know	sd	3
Uh we didnt we didnt know	We didnt know because then it stops though	sd	3
We didnt know because then it stops though	Yeah but it was interesting for for a while	sd	1
Yeah but it was interesting for for a while	While it was going on it was very	sd	1
While it was going on it was very	We were kind of uh	sd	1
We were kind of uh	Are we going to	sd	1

And we were also trying to find like you know how we had when we had a plus b to the n	We want to know what And we had like numbers before it when we got to big numbers we want to know you figure out what the numbers were like in front of the a you know cubed	sd	2
We want to know what And we had like numbers before it when we got to big numbers we want to know you figure out what the numbers were like in front of the a you know cubed	You know thats thats like um	sd	1
You could use the board too	Uh we just Like if you were looking if we were looking for like a plus b	sd	4

Now how do you	Its fortyfive also	sd	2
Its fortyfive also	Like how do you how do you how do you do that on a calculator	qy	3
Howd you do that so fast Michael	Um	b	1
Um	No I just like did it all in my head thats all	sd	1
No I just like did it all in my head thats all	You go to uh math	sd	1
Tell us how you did it	Um	b	1
Um	Probability	aa	4
Probability	Theres a button that	sd	1
Theres a button that	NCR	aa	1
NCR	Take ten that button then eight	sd	4
Take ten that button then eight	Then math	sd	2

And it comes out fortyfive	Why is that the case	sd	3
Why is that the case	Hm	b	1
Hm	Well if you take like on the	sd	1
Well if you take like on the	Well because	sd	1
Well because	You know how on Pascals Triangle	sd	2
You know how on Pascals Triangle	Thats like the two	sd	2
Thats like the two	You have eight left over	sd	2
You have eight left over	Oh cause you could switch them all around	sd	2
Oh cause you could switch them all around	Is that is that I guess youre counting	sd	2
Tell me	Cause then you would have	sd	1
Cause then you would have	Is that the same thing as that because like the eight left over to get to the ten right	sd	4
Is that the same thing as that because like the eight left over to get to the ten right	Itll be It would be the same thing	sd	2
Itll be It would be the same thing	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	Its like almost switching colors	sd	2
Its like almost switching colors	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Itd be like two of the other color	sd	2
Say that one more time Romina	Itd be two of the other color instead of like say you started with red for this two	sd	5
Itd be two of the other color instead of like say you started with red for this two	That was for the reds and then when you make red eight	sd	5
That was for the reds and then when you make red eight	That would be the other eight	sd	2
That would be the other eight	The like say the blues have two	sd	2
The like say the blues have two	And its seven	sd	2
And its seven	And then obviously three should be the same as that	sd	2
And then obviously three should be the same as that	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
So youre pressing the calculator you have a new command that gets you those numbers	We know how to do it I mean its not	sd	1
But if you didnt have the calculator	Wed write them out	sd	1
Wed write them out	Youd have to write them all out	sd	1
Because Alex wants to know how you do that without a calculator	Well I obviously if the calculator	sd	1
Can you can you help him understand that	Well we would make a say tower of ten	sd	4
Well we would make a say tower of ten	Can I say something	sd	1
Can I say something	All right um	aa	1
All right um	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Bob	aa	1
Bob	Yeah go for it	sd	1
Yeah go for it	No Im talking I just wanted to say that Bob Sidley had like an actual formula to write the equals and	sd	2
No Im talking I just wanted to say that Bob Sidley had like an actual formula to write the equals and	Do we know do we know what it is	sd	3
Do we know do we know what it is	I think so	sv	1
I think so	I dont know if I can remember it	sd	1
Why dont I leave you a few minutes and think about explaining this to us	It depends on	sd	1
It depends on	Well its not its not that hard to explain	sd	1
Well its not its not that hard to explain	You remember it	sd	1
You remember it	I forgot it	sd	1
OK Ill stay then	Well actually no	sd	1
Well actually no	Its not right	sd	1
Its not right	All right	aa	1
He has a bad memory	I got to like do trial and error to see if I can figure it out what it was	sd	1
OK	All right say thats ten	sd	4
All right say thats ten	Then um you would just have to find Say you had uh one was one color and two was the other color	sd	4
Then um you would just have to find Say you had uh one was one color and two was the other color	Why why dont you show her how to do it for like three	sd	1
Why why dont you show her how to do it for like three	Show them how we can get all of them	sd	1
Show them how we can get all of them	That you have to draw the tower	sd	2
That you have to draw the tower	You have two colors	sd	2
You have two colors	And out of this tower of three youd have to find out all the different places you could put those two colors in	sd	5
And out of this tower of three youd have to find out all the different places you could put those two colors in	So you could put it there and there	sd	5
So you could put it there and there	Or you could put it uh there and there	sd	5
Or you could put it uh there and there	Or am I missing any	sd	2
I understand	You could just do like	sd	1
You could just do like	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Do you want to go for another one	sd	1
Do you want to go for another one	No go for it	sd	1
No go for it	No you could just do you could do like our blue blue blue	sd	1
No you could just do you could do like our blue blue blue	You gonna write every one	sd	1
You gonna write every one	Well there wasnt that many	sd	1
Well there wasnt that many	No Im just like giving you an example	sd	1
No Im just like giving you an example	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then you just kind of move it through	sd	1
And then you just kind of move it through	And thats how we figure them out when we have to write them out	sd	1
So youre saying theres a way of getting these without the calculator	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And theres a theres a formula that somebody	sd	4
And theres a theres a formula that somebody	Not too	sd	2
Not too	had come up with but I dont know I dont know how it how it goes	sd	3
had come up with but I dont know I dont know how it how it goes	Im really not sure	sd	3

No thats thats choose to the thats how you write it I think	I think thats how you write it	sv	2
I think thats how you write it	Thats just thats what it is	sd	2
Do you want an equals sign there	No	sd	1
No	Thats thats not in Yeah	ba	1
Thats thats not in Yeah	Yeah I could do that	sd	1
Yeah I could do that	Times x	aa	4

All right what are we going to do	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh yeah um	b	1
Oh yeah um	What what does that get	sd	3
What what does that get	That gets you like	sv	1
That gets you like	That gives you that choose thing	sv	2
That gives you that choose thing	That gives you	sd	1
That gives you	I dont I dont know what it means	sd	3
I dont I dont know what it means	I was working with him one day when he brought that up but he lost me	sd	3
I was working with him one day when he brought that up but he lost me	That was the day that me and and my table were doing the uh finding the square roots without a calculator	sd	1
That was the day that me and and my table were doing the uh finding the square roots without a calculator	Yeah but he did that before like	sd	1
Yeah but he did that before like	Not with me	sd	1
Not with me	In class when he was talking about choosing	sd	1
In class when he was talking about choosing	Who	sd	1

I was in your group	Oh gee you got an eyelash	sd	1
Oh gee you got an eyelash	No in class when he was talking about choosing	sd	1
No in class when he was talking about choosing	He figured it out	sd	1
He figured it out	And	sd	1
And	All right um well you figure say you do uh say youre doing three right	sd	1
All right um well you figure say you do uh say youre doing three right	So that would be three times two times one	sd	5
So that would be three times two times one	That would be each space I imagine	sd	5
That would be each space I imagine	And x is how many how many you want of the color	sd	2
And x is how many how many you want of the color	Yeah I guess that would be how many combinations	sd	2
Yeah I guess that would be how many combinations	Yeah that would because that would give you the total number of	sd	5
Yeah that would because that would give you the total number of	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah that d be it yeah	sd	2
Yeah that d be it yeah	Total number of combinations	sd	2
Total number of combinations	Oh I guess yeah	b	2
Oh I guess yeah	All right	b	2
All right	So then that would be say six factorial	sd	2
So then that would be say six factorial	Divided by	sd	2
Divided by	That would be Why would you why where does that work	sd	3
That would be Why would you why where does that work	No wait	sd	2
No wait	This is that would be	sv	1
This is that would be	Come on x is the number we want and x is like the number we want to get like the choose number	sd	2
Come on x is the number we want and x is like the number we want to get like the choose number	Thats the yeah choosing number	ba	2
Thats the yeah choosing number	And	sd	1
And	So I guess this would	sd	1
So I guess this would	He was telling me like this was	sd	1
He was telling me like this was	That would like take away all the all the ones we would choose	sd	2
That would like take away all the all the ones we would choose	He said something about repeats	sd	2
He said something about repeats	One would take away the repeats	sd	2
One would take away the repeats	Yeah this would this would take away the repeats right	sd	2
Yeah this would this would take away the repeats right	I guess	aa	2
I guess	And will this and this will give you	sd	2
And will this and this will give you	And this will this will take away the	sd	2
And this will this will take away the	This will take away all the other ones	sd	2
This will take away all the other ones	The other ones that that you dont care where they are	sd	2

Would you mind Jeff	All right I need help because	sd	3
Theyll help you	I dont want to get stuck	sd	1
I dont want to get stuck	I got stuck up there last time by myself and I was looking like an idiot	sd	1
I got stuck up there last time by myself and I was looking like an idiot	All right the reason why this works	sd	1
All right the reason why this works	We have no chalk	sd	1
We have no chalk	Right there in the side	sd	1
Right there in the side	All right the reason why this works first you get all the total number of this will cover all the total possibilities of your tower	sd	4
All right the reason why this works first you get all the total number of this will cover all the total possibilities of your tower	And factorial	sd	2
And factorial	Say in terms of a tower	sd	2
Say in terms of a tower	The factorial right here	sd	2
The factorial right here	So say youre doing towers of three	sd	2

You have the three factorial and thatll cover all of the different combinations that you could put three in with two colors	All right	aa	1
All right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Sounds good	ba	2
Just go	Like you should use the explanation like she used	sd	2
Like you should use the explanation like she used	Like the people on the line	sd	2
Like the people on the line	Thats better because you have like the first one	sv	2
Thats better because you have like the first one	Then you have	sd	2
Then you have	Two spaces	sd	2
Two spaces	All right Ill do people on the line	sd	2
All right Ill do people on the line	Two spaces	sd	2
Two spaces	You have two people left so thats times two	sd	2
You have two people left so thats times two	All right say were doing us three right here	sd	2
All right say were doing us three right here	Yeah on the line	sd	2
Yeah on the line	This us three um	sd	2
This us three um	Theres three different people to fill in the first spot	sd	2
Theres three different people to fill in the first spot	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Then theres after then once one goes there theres only two people left to fill in this spot	sd	2
Then theres after then once one goes there theres only two people left to fill in this spot	And then	sd	1
And then	So you multiply three and two	sd	2
So you multiply three and two	Three times two and then once once someone goes in the other theres only one person left	sd	5
Three times two and then once once someone goes in the other theres only one person left	And they get the last spot so thats times the one	sd	5
And they get the last spot so thats times the one	And thats everyone	sd	2
And thats everyone	That make more sense	sd	1
Well Im I didnt mind your other example here	Yeah I I just like the okay through the way so I could move	sd	1
Yeah I I just like the okay through the way so I could move	You know steady progress	sd	1
But I guess so why are you multiplying	We dont like that question	sd	1
We dont like that question	Ah	b	1
You dont like that question	No	sd	1
No	That that one gets us all the time	sd	1
Why arent you adding	Uh because you dont add	sd	1
Uh because you dont add	Its just you dont do it	sd	1
Its just you dont do it	Theres no adding going on it any where anymore	sd	1
Theres no adding going on it any where anymore	Thats like out of style	sd	1
Thats not the answer	I know that doesnt that doesnt work	sd	1
I know that doesnt that doesnt work	Um you do it because uh	sd	1
Um you do it because uh	I cant help you on this one	sd	1
I cant help you on this one	Thats a good question	sd	1
OK Ill leave you to tell me	Why do you multiply	qy	3
Youll figure that out	We never know this one	sd	1
We never know this one	Yeah its like the eternal question	sd	1
Yeah its like the eternal question	Yeah its cause if if you have three things theres three things you put here right	sd	4
Yeah its cause if if you have three things theres three things you put here right	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	There s red white and blue	sd	4
There s red white and blue	And then theres only	sd	4
And then theres only	Uh are we	sd	1

two things	And if theres two more	sd	2
And if theres two more	Out of that two	sd	2
Out of that two	Were doing just two colors	sd	2
Were doing just two colors	Were doing two colors	sd	2
Were doing two colors	If you have like three things right	sd	2
If you have like three things right	To explain it maybe you want to do three different colors	sd	2
To explain it maybe you want to do three different colors	No	sd	2
No	Yeah all right maybe we can do that	sd	2
Yeah all right maybe we can do that	All right how you saying this	sd	3
All right how you saying this	There s red white and blue right	sd	2
There s red white and blue right	OK	b	1
OK	You take if red goes over here that means you only have with red there could go either go white and blue	sd	2
You take if red goes over here that means you only have with red there could go either go white and blue	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	Like its each one of those three goes with two more	sd	2
Like its each one of those three goes with two more	You know what I mean	sd	2
You know what I mean	Theres three things	sd	2
Theres three things	You could see how you got this	sd	2
You could see how you got this	here and then theres two things here	sd	2
here and then theres two things here	You can say you have	sd	1
You can say you have	All right yeah	b	2
All right yeah	Each one of those those three goes with two other	sd	2
Each one of those those three goes with two other	Those three things go with	sd	2
Those three things go with	Oh OK like with our line thing	sd	2
Oh OK like with our line thing	So its three times two	sd	2
So its three times two	All right	aa	1
All right	Like our line thing	sd	2
Like our line thing	Or you could say like you have two more colors to add on	sd	2
Or you could say like you have two more colors to add on	So you could do you could make these into two different combinations	sd	2
So you could do you could make these into two different combinations	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So thats two	ba	2

All right so then all right	Uh Researcher 1	aa	1
Uh Researcher 1	Researcher 1	sd	1
Researcher 1	All right I think were good with this	sv	1
Explain it to me on the board	All right the reason here Ankur	sd	1
All right the reason here Ankur	Just do it youre right there	sd	1
Just do it youre right there	You re standing	sd	1
You re standing	You could just say it	sd	1
You could just say it	Um just do it with three colors	sd	1
Um just do it with three colors	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	All right say you have three colors red white and blue	sd	4
All right say you have three colors red white and blue	Uh here you do it	sd	1
Uh here you do it	Yeah one of those colors goes in the first	sd	4
Yeah one of those colors goes in the first	All right	aa	1
All right	One of those colors goes in the first spot	sd	4
One of those colors goes in the first spot	So say you have your three spots	sv	2
So say you have your three spots	Say red goes in the first one all right	sd	2
Say red goes in the first one all right	Then you could do	sv	2
Then you could do	Either one of them	sd	2
Either one of them	Draw the line to the white and the blue	sd	2
Draw the line to the white and the blue	One one color goes in the first spot so theres two colors left	sd	5
One one color goes in the first spot so theres two colors left	So theres three different colors that can go in the first spot and each of those colors can go with two other colors	sd	5
So theres three different colors that can go in the first spot and each of those colors can go with two other colors	Two other ones	sd	2
Two other ones	So this is either going to be a white and blue or a blue and a white	sd	2
So this is either going to be a white and blue or a blue and a white	Right	b	1
Right	And then Or the white could to the first thing and this is going to be one of the two other colors or the blues going to go here and its going to be the other two are going to be the combination either way of the other one	sd	5
And then Or the white could to the first thing and this is going to be one of the two other colors or the blues going to go here and its going to be the other two are going to be the combination either way of the other one	So thats why you multiply	ba	5
So thats why you multiply	Make that a B	sd	1
Make that a B	I used to have a BandAid on and now I can get the chalk to stick to my finger	sd	1
What does this have to do with the towers and what you were showing me about a plus b to the n	Well you want you asked us why you multiply	ba	1
And why why they would be	We just answered why we multiply	sd	1
We just answered why we multiply	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Were not there yet	sd	1
OK	Were still working on that	sd	1
Were still working on that	Yeah all right	b	1
Yeah all right	All right	b	1
All right	So thats why you multiply	ba	5
So thats why you multiply	All right	b	1
All right	Moving on	sd	1
Moving on	So thats why thats three factorial	sd	5
So thats why thats three factorial	So thats all right thats good	ba	1
So thats all right thats good	Thats all your combinations right there	sd	2
Thats all your combinations right there	Yeah	b	2

So you	So youre going to take a number so that would be that would be three and the same reason the threes up there its coming down here	sd	2
So youre going to take a number so that would be that would be three and the same reason the threes up there its coming down here	Then itll give you one	sd	2
Then itll give you one	Wait the reason you subtract thats why youre raising the how come the x is there	sd	3
Wait the reason you subtract thats why youre raising the how come the x is there	Because youre raising it to two um	sd	2
Because youre raising it to two um	Thats it	ba	2
Thats it	Right	b	2

One twenty	And then the five minus two comes comes in where youre not worried about everyone youre just worried about two people at a time	sd	5
And then the five minus two comes comes in where youre not worried about everyone youre just worried about two people at a time	So we need to subtract the five minus two	sd	5
So we need to subtract the five minus two	Those get that gives you and you do factorial that gives you all the possibilities of just two people right	sv	5
Those get that gives you and you do factorial that gives you all the possibilities of just two people right	No that gives you	sv	2
No that gives you	Three people	sd	2
Three people	No three extras	sd	2
No three extras	The three that you dont youre not worried about	sd	2
The three that you dont youre not worried about	Thats going to eliminate everyone except the two people youre worried about	sd	2
Thats going to eliminate everyone except the two people youre worried about	OK	sd	1
OK	Everyone except the two people youre worried about	sd	2
Everyone except the two people youre worried about	And then the x factorial eliminates except the	sd	2
And then the x factorial eliminates except the	When the two people	sd	2
When the two people	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	When the two people are switched back and forth when you have the same ones over again	sd	2
When the two people are switched back and forth when you have the same ones over again	OK	b	1
I think Im getting switch back So could you give me an example	Like when you have when you have like person A and over here	sd	4
Like when you have when you have like person A and over here	You want to stand up and show them	sd	1
You want to stand up and show them	And person B over here	sd	4
And person B over here	And then you have person B and person A	sd	4
And then you have person B and person A	You want to be in a line and well show them	sd	1
Michael start from the beginning very slow	All right	b	1
All right	You have five people	sd	4
Stand up and show us	All right Im going to sit in your seat cause I can t see	sd	1
All right Im going to sit in your seat cause I can t see	Im going to write it nice and clear so you all can see	sd	1
Im going to write it nice and clear so you all can see	All right	b	1
All right	You got five people in a line	sd	4
You got five people in a line	You agree with me thats how many different combinations you can put those five people	sd	1
That part I understand	All right	aa	1
I understood the multiplication that you showed	Now in youre only worried you want to know how many different places you can put those two people	sd	4
Now in youre only worried you want to know how many different places you can put those two people	All right	aa	1
All right	So in all the combinations youre going to have theyre going to be repeated a lot	sd	5
So in all the combinations youre going to have theyre going to be repeated a lot	A lot	sd	5
A lot	When you have like the two people in a certain place and you know those three	sd	5
When you have like the two people in a certain place and you know those three	If the three are are like this	sd	5
If the three are are like this	And then one of them switches thats another combination	sd	5
And then one of them switches thats another combination	And you get a lot of repeats like that	sd	5
OK	So by eliminating that you eliminate the combinations that repeat by the three people moving around	sd	5
Uhhum	Then lets say you just have those two people in in any given combination	sd	5
Then lets say you just have those two people in in any given combination	If if one if this guy switches the place with this guy its the theyre different combinations but in this were not worried about where they are	sd	5
If if one if this guy switches the place with this guy its the theyre different combinations but in this were not worried about where they are	We just you understand	sd	1
Mm hm	Thats why we get rid of the the two factorial to to uh eliminate the amount like as many times as you could as many combinations as you could put those two people	sd	5
Thats why we get rid of the the two factorial to to uh eliminate the amount like as many times as you could as many combinations as you could put those two people	Right	b	1
Right	Like the three would would be to eliminate the combinations you could put those three people that youre not worried about	sd	5
Like the three would would be to eliminate the combinations you could put those three people that youre not worried about	Then the two they would repeat because those people too they move around	sd	5
Then the two they would repeat because those people too they move around	They they could they move around in the in the line also	sd	5
They they could they move around in the in the line also	And then when when when youre done with all that you just get um you get how many places you can just put that two	sd	5
And then when when when youre done with all that you just get um you get how many places you can just put that two	Like youre not worried if like you dont care who they are	sd	5
Like youre not worried if like you dont care who they are	You dont care like if this guy has a switch with this guy	sd	5
You dont care like if this guy has a switch with this guy	You understand like why you would eliminate how that eliminates	sd	5
And now Im thinking of towers that are five tall	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You can we just	sd	1
And were talking of those that have two reds	Yeah	b	1
Explain it to me with that	All right	b	1
All right	Say say were doing were doing towers that were were five tall	sd	5
Say say were doing were doing towers that were were five tall	Towers of five tall with two different colors in it	sd	5
Towers of five tall with two different colors in it	Then thats the total amount of possibilities is the five factorial that you could have	sd	5
Then thats the total amount of possibilities is the five factorial that you could have	All right in with with five high with the combinations	sd	5
All right in with with five high with the combinations	So thats where thats the five factorial on top	sd	5
So thats where thats the five factorial on top	Then the three factorial on the bottom would be five different five different spots minus the two spots that youre concerned about leaving you with the three other spots	sd	5
Then the three factorial on the bottom would be five different five different spots minus the two spots that youre concerned about leaving you with the three other spots	You could say	sv	1
You could say	that you dont care about	sv	1
that you dont care about	Thats going to eliminate all of them	sd	4
Thats going to eliminate all of them	Thats like if you say like the reds	sd	2
Thats like if you say like the reds	Lets say reds are our two colors that they stay in the same place and like	sd	2
Lets say reds are our two colors that they stay in the same place and like	Theyre	sd	1
Theyre	Like yeah the two stay in the same place and then the other three are just switching while theyre in staying in the same place	sd	2
Like yeah the two stay in the same place and then the other three are just switching while theyre in staying in the same place	Yeah theyre staying in the same spot	sd	2
Yeah theyre staying in the same spot	But were not concerned with them	sd	2
But were not concerned with them	Thats why youre not concerned with those	sd	5
Thats why youre not concerned with those	Its going to repeat like six times	sd	2
Its going to repeat like six times	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So thats where the three factorial comes from and youre multiplying that by the two factorial	sd	5
So thats where the three factorial comes from and youre multiplying that by the two factorial	Those are what youre	sd	1
Those are what youre	Thats to say like the first place and the third place and then they just switch	sd	2
Thats to say like the first place and the third place and then they just switch	Yeah like this way	aa	2
Yeah like this way	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	They just dont have a name on them so the theyre the same thing	sd	2
They just dont have a name on them so the theyre the same thing	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And then thats where the bottom number comes from and then you divide them by each other and that gives you what were looking for	sd	5
But why were we doing this	Uh you we dont	sd	1
Uh you we dont	We were talking about	sd	1
We were talking about	We want you wanted us to explain choose	sd	1
We want you wanted us to explain choose	The choose that we all right whoa	sd	1
The choose that we all right whoa	Which goes back to Pascals Triangle and see where a plus b	sd	4
Which goes back to Pascals Triangle and see where a plus b	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	to the n	sd	4
to the n	And we could figure out the beginning number	sd	4
And we could figure out the beginning number	All right	b	1
All right	Over here you wanted the a plus b to the n thing you wanted to know how we got the choose thing	sd	2
Over here you wanted the a plus b to the n thing you wanted to know how we got the choose thing	What does that mean	sd	3
What does that mean	Yeah how we got the third number	sd	2
Yeah how we got the third number	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And thats how we got off to to here	sd	2
OK so what did that have to do with what you did in class today	Thats how we would get the number	sd	4
Thats how we would get the number	We were looking at we were doing this in class today	sd	2
We were looking at we were doing this in class today	Thats what we were doing	sd	2
Thats what we were doing	We were looking at a plus b	sd	2
We were looking at a plus b	Were going to be	sd	1
Were going to be	It was like in Pascals Triangle things go like by that	sd	2
It was like in Pascals Triangle things go like by that	Like this choose this	sd	2
Like this choose this	Like um if you go to the one three three one part of it it would be um	sd	2
Show me on the board Michael	Go get em Mike	sd	1
Go get em Mike	This would be like all right this would be like three choose one	sd	5
This would be like all right this would be like three choose one	How many different places you put that one that one guy	sd	5
How many different places you put that one that one guy	Theres only one place	sd	5
Theres only one place	Theres only oh Im wrong	sd	5
Theres only oh Im wrong	What am I doing	sd	3
What am I doing	Thats when you only have like its all one color	sd	2
Thats when you only have like its all one color	No there theres a way it has something to do with I think that would be three choose zero I guess	sd	5
No there theres a way it has something to do with I think that would be three choose zero I guess	No	sd	5
No	All right and then the next one would be three choose three	sd	5
All right and then the next one would be three choose three	Obviously three different places	sd	5
What was the next one	Three choose one	sd	5
Three choose one	The next would be three choose two which we just figured that out	sd	5
The next would be three choose two which we just figured that out	Theres three	sd	5
Theres three	And last one is three choose three	sd	5
And last one is three choose three	You can only put those three people in those three places	sd	5
You can only put those three people in those three places	You cant you know no more places to put them	sd	5
You could write more rows of that triangle	Yeah	b	1
So can you take lets say another row or two and show me the addition rule and what it looks like with your new notation	You re talking about the addition rule when you	sd	4
For a particular for a particular row	Add this and this and go like that	sd	4
Do you understand my question	Uh I dont really	sd	3
Uh I dont really	I dont understand	sd	3
I dont understand	Instead of writing three you write	sd	1
You explained to me	Why you add	qy	1
Why you add	Yeah	b	1
You might might be useful for folks who havent heard it to hear it whatever way you want to explain it	I dont think I can explain it too good	sd	1
Youve had it a few ways	Um I cant I cant remember too well	sd	1
Um I cant I cant remember too well	I know why you add if I explain it I dont think anyone will understand	sd	1
I know why you add if I explain it I dont think anyone will understand	I didnt	sd	1
I didnt	Didnt I tell you guys like last time I came here	sd	1
Didnt I tell you guys like last time I came here	Well go for it dude just	sd	1
Well go for it dude just	You could try	sd	1
You could try	You dont have that paper do you	qy	1
You dont have that paper do you	You can just hand them hand that out	sd	1
You can just hand them hand that out	You started talking about toppings	sd	2
You started talking about toppings	I think something	sv	1
I think something	Hand that out instead	sd	1
Hand that out instead	Um all right	b	1
Um all right	If all right lets go to lets go to this one	sd	1
If all right lets go to lets go to this one	This would be like three different places I guess	sd	4
This would be like three different places I guess	Which one are we looking at	sd	1
Which one are we looking at	That one right there	sd	1
That one right there	You have three	sd	4
You have three	That would be a plus b to the third	sd	2
That would be a plus b to the third	All right lets say you have like heres a number all right	sd	2
All right lets say you have like heres a number all right	Zero means no toppings	sd	2
Zero means no toppings	One would this one would be	sd	2
One would this one would be	It would be one s a topping	sd	2
It would be one s a topping	One would be a topping	sd	2
One would be a topping	So first category is everything with no toppings	sd	5
So first category is everything with no toppings	And thats you cant make thats thats your number for that one	sv	5
And thats you cant make thats thats your number for that one	Next would be Theres all the the ones that have one topping	sd	5
Next would be Theres all the the ones that have one topping	Right you got to make that zero at the end	sd	5
Right you got to make that zero at the end	You messed up	sd	2
You messed up	What	ba	1
What	Last one should be a hundred not a hundred and one	sd	2
Last one should be a hundred not a hundred and one	I knew that	sd	1
I knew that	Theres your um your three choose one	sd	5
Theres your um your three choose one	And theres three different combinations you could put that	sd	5
And theres three different combinations you could put that	Um I can go on forever doing this	sd	5
Um I can go on forever doing this	But um when you have a new when you add another place another topping	sd	5
But um when you have a new when you add another place another topping	That could be one or the other one or the other one or the other	sd	2
That could be one or the other one or the other one or the other	So it could be one or the other	sd	2
So it could be one or the other	It could be a zero or a one a zero or a one a zero or a one	sd	2
It could be a zero or a one a zero or a one a zero or a one	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	All right	aa	1
All right	So all these threes would either move up a step onto the next category and uh have two toppings	sd	5
So all these threes would either move up a step onto the next category and uh have two toppings	Or they might stay behind and still only have one if they have the zero	sd	5
Or they might stay behind and still only have one if they have the zero	So three three will get a topping and go to this one	sd	5
So three three will get a topping and go to this one	And three won t will stay	sd	5
And three won t will stay	And obviously this guy s going to get a topping	sd	5
And obviously this guy s going to get a topping	That s why you add this one	sd	5
That s why you add this one	Uhhuh	b	2
Uhhuh	So now this guys going to have without toppings	sd	5
So now this guys going to have without toppings	Youre going to add a topping onto him	sd	5
Youre going to add a topping onto him	Thats going to be one topping	sd	5
Thats going to be one topping	These three with one topping wont get one so you know	sd	5
These three with one topping wont get one so you know	Thats their four	sd	2
Thats their four	You put you can put them in the same category as this one	sd	2
You put you can put them in the same category as this one	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Thats four	ba	2
Thats four	Those are your four	sd	2
Those are your four	And you know	sd	1
And you know	Three	sd	2
Three	Those three	sd	2
Those three	The three that had two toppings wont get any	sd	2
The three that had two toppings wont get any	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So they ll go to	sd	1
So they ll go to	And you could put them in together with the ones that did get something	sd	5
And you could put them in together with the ones that did get something	That s why you would add	ba	5
That s why you would add	Keep on adding	sd	2
What do you mean by toppings	Pizza toppings	sd	4
Um for example	Like here you would have a choice of three different ones	sd	5
Like here you would have a choice of three different ones	Here you would have a choice of five and like the ones would be like the mushrooms the peppers the whatever just by going like	sd	5
Here you would have a choice of five and like the ones would be like the mushrooms the peppers the whatever just by going like	The one would indicate you have it or not	sd	5
I remember	You remember	sd	1
One three three one	Mm hm	sd	1
If I wrote these as chooses the way you re writing them	Three choose zero three choose one	sd	4
This is three choose zero	Yeah	b	1
This is three choose one	Choose one	sd	1
Choose one	Same thing	sd	2
Three choose	Two and three choose then three choose three choose three	sd	4
Right	So that s how you get it	sv	5
So that s how you get it	It s like the same thing cause like three and zero is like three and three right	sd	5
It s like the same thing cause like three and zero is like three and three right	And then three two	sd	5
And then three two	You want us to write the triangle looking like that	sd	4
I would I would I would like you to do that and then tell me what the general rule is	All right	aa	1
So so I d like you to write out some of the rows with the triangle and then I d like	So to use it like like that	sd	1
So to use it like like that	Like the next one would be uh four choose zero	sd	4
Like the next one would be uh four choose zero	Yeah and	b	2
Yeah and	The four choose zero then four choose one four choose two	sd	5
The four choose zero then four choose one four choose two	Four choose one four choose two	sd	2
Four choose one four choose two	Four choose three	sd	2
Four choose three	We re in a bad place	sd	2
You probably want to use this	Yeah	b	1
So that people can read it	Um	b	1
Um	Ask them your question one more time	sd	1
OK so I d like you to rewrite your triangle if you like	From top to bottom	sd	1
Top to bottom	Do you want the ones and like	sd	1
Do you want the ones and like	All right	aa	1
All right	So what	sd	1
I want everything	What would	sd	1
Do you understand	Uhhuh	b	1
Uhhuh	Thats thats easy	ba	1
And then I would like the general row	Is that one	sd	1
Where you have towers	Thats a zero no that s zero choose zero	sd	4
Thats a zero no that s zero choose zero	X high	sd	2
Something like that	All right well thats	aa	1
So he can tell you	See like that	sd	4
See like that	So it would be um like N over not two over	sd	2
So it would be um like N over not two over	Well it would be	sd	2
Well it would be	N choose	sd	2
N choose	It would be	sd	2
It would be	Well and N make N like your height or something	sd	2
Well and N make N like your height or something	All right so say	sd	1
All right so say	N equals height	sd	2
N equals height	Well that would	sd	1
Well that would	Well write the X	sd	5
Well write the X	Write a plus b to the whatever it is next to it	sd	5
Write a plus b to the whatever it is next to it	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	You know what I mean	sd	1
You know what I mean	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So right	b	1
So right	That would be a plus b to the	sd	2
That would be a plus b to the	This would be nothing you know it would be adding	sd	2
This would be nothing you know it would be adding	So a plus b to the second	sd	2
So a plus b to the second	Well itd be like N over N minus but what	sd	3
Well itd be like N over N minus but what	Yeah well a plus b to the second so it would be if or a plus b to the nth	sd	2
Yeah well a plus b to the second so it would be if or a plus b to the nth	To the	sd	1
To the	No all you need is like	sd	1
No all you need is like	N is factorial	sd	2
N is factorial	Itd be n n over	sd	2
Itd be n n over	n fa	sd	2
n fa	No thats just like No its not right Im just saying like	sd	2
No thats just like No its not right Im just saying like	It would be	sd	1
It would be	You would have to multiply it	sd	2
You would have to multiply it	n over	sd	2
n over	Well if you had an n it would be uh	sd	2
Well if you had an n it would be uh	To the height of the tower which is n right	sd	2
To the height of the tower which is n right	Youd have a bunch of ns	sd	2
Youd have a bunch of ns	Yeah and itd be over just z	sd	2
Yeah and itd be over just z	Thered be n plus one ns going this way	sd	2
Thered be n plus one ns going this way	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	All right	aa	1
All right	it would be n over 0	sd	2
it would be n over 0	So if n was three youd have four ns going this way	sd	5
So if n was three youd have four ns going this way	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And the bottom numbers would be just going from 0 to	sd	2
And the bottom numbers would be just going from 0 to	To	b	1
To	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Well yeah	b	2
Well yeah	0 to n	sd	2
0 to n	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	To n	sd	2
To n	To n	sd	2
To n	Whatever n equals	sd	2
Whatever n equals	Is there a way to write that you know how to write over times	sd	3
Is there a way to write that you know how to write over times	I guess	aa	1
I guess	Yeah so how do you yeah wait now that makes sense but so it would be n over 0 to the nth	sd	2
Yeah so how do you yeah wait now that makes sense but so it would be n over 0 to the nth	And whatever	sd	1
And whatever	Zero what are you talking about	sd	3
Zero what are you talking about	Wherever youre looking for	sd	2
Wherever youre looking for	What are you talking about 0 to the n	sd	2
What are you talking about 0 to the n	0 minus n	sd	2
0 minus n	That would be negative	sd	2
That would be negative	No not minus like thats to whatever n is n over 0 n over 1	sd	2
No not minus like thats to whatever n is n over 0 n over 1	1	b	2
1	Not divided by like n 1 n uh 2 n 3	sd	2
Not divided by like n 1 n uh 2 n 3	That was	sd	1
That was	All the way until n could be over n	sd	2
All the way until n could be over n	You know what Im saying	sd	1
You know what Im saying	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Not not divided by	sd	2
Not not divided by	I was using bad uh bad looking things there	sd	1
I was using bad uh bad looking things there	Each of those would be a number	sd	2
Each of those would be a number	And n represents the height of the tower	sd	2
And n represents the height of the tower	The height of the tower yup	sd	2
Do you want that divided sign here	No	b	1
On that one	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	Cross that off	sd	1
Cross that off	No	b	2
No	I was using it to separate and that was that s a habit of mine it looks bad	sd	1
I was using it to separate and that was that s a habit of mine it looks bad	Oh sorry about that	sd	1
Oh sorry about that	It would be uh as many it s like height of the tower with two colors	sd	2
It would be uh as many it s like height of the tower with two colors	You have two numbers	sd	2
You have two numbers	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	How do you how are you can you write that to get this	qy	2
How do you how are you can you write that to get this	Like that s what I meant	sd	2
Like that s what I meant	Like I didn t mean factorial	sd	2
Like I didn t mean factorial	I meant like when we used four first and like three first	sd	2
I meant like when we used four first and like three first	I don t know how to write that though	sd	3
So you go 0 1 2 3 dot dot dot up to n	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mm hm	sd	2
Can we get one in the middle there like n choose r	Like how would you just go right to n choose 3	sd	3
Like how would you just go right to n choose 3	Or n choose r	sd	3
Or n choose r	Like what	sd	1
Like what	What are you talking about	sd	3
What are you talking about	Like instead of using 0 1 2 3	sd	4
Like instead of using 0 1 2 3	r being any number on the bottom	sd	2
Because you said n choose x up there	Yeah	b	1
I just picked what I wanted	Yeah so so it would be	sd	1
Yeah so so it would be	Um	b	1
Um	n choose	sd	4
n choose	It would be n	sd	2
It would be n	Wouldn t that just be n choose r for whatever r you wanted	sd	2
Wouldn t that just be n choose r for whatever r you wanted	Whatever number you wanted up to as long as it didn t exceed n	sd	2
Whatever number you wanted up to as long as it didn t exceed n	This this is different than that	sd	2
This this is different than that	Isn t it	sd	2
Isn t it	Like this these are just like a list of numbers	sd	2
Like this these are just like a list of numbers	That s that s just giving you one of these numbers	sd	2
That s that s just giving you one of these numbers	Uh you know all that but I m saying if you wanted to write n choose to get a certain number wouldn t it just be n choose r	sd	2
Uh you know all that but I m saying if you wanted to write n choose to get a certain number wouldn t it just be n choose r	Like that	sd	2
Like that	And then as long as r doesn t exceed n or it s less than 0 like r	sd	2
And then as long as r doesn t exceed n or it s less than 0 like r	Wouldn t that equal that	ba	2
Wouldn t that equal that	Yeah wouldn t it	aa	2
Yeah wouldn t it	I guess you could write one of those	sd	1
I guess you could write one of those	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Isn t it supposed to equal that	sd	2
Isn t it supposed to equal that	Right there	aa	1
Right there	That s that is	ba	1
That s that is	It s the same thing	sd	2
It s the same thing	That does	sd	2
That does	You could do that	sd	2
You could do that	It s a lot of	sd	2
OK so you ve written out three rows and then you wrote out the nth row	The reason why 0 1 2 3 is that number is always going to be that number	sd	5
The reason why 0 1 2 3 is that number is always going to be that number	It s not it s never going to change	sd	5
Something in here could be an n choose r	Mm hm	sd	1
That s what I heard you say Jeff	Yes	b	1
Sort of a general one in here n choose x	That s what	sd	1
Whatever you choose to use	Yeah that s what that is	sd	1
Yeah that s what that is	So yeah	b	1
You ve written out two rows and you have the third one there	Mm hm	sd	1
Maybe somebody will come up here and write these up nicely	Is that what you want	sd	1
Thanks	You want to erase those	sd	1
You want to erase those	You want to make that the line so bad	sd	1
You want to make that the line so bad	I know	aa	1
I know	No don t do that	sd	1
No don t do that	How far do you want him to go	sd	3
How far do you want him to go	One more	sd	1
One more	I want to uh	sd	1
I want to uh	You want one more for good measure	sd	1
You want one more for good measure	No	sd	1
No	Don t worry about it	sd	1
Go to the nth one then	Wouldn t that just be	sd	1
Dot dot dot	N zero	sd	4
N zero	Dot dot dot N to the N	sd	2
Is the last one N N	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	Yeah	b	2
Do you want to put it at the end	Yeah put it at the end make it nice	sd	1
What would you how would you show the middle one	Uh actually you could put N X	sd	4
N choose X N choose N	Those are dots because you can t really make a dot	sd	1
Those are dots because you can t really make a dot	Now you can	sd	1
Let s say from give me an example from the third fourth row to the fifth row	Fourth row to this	sd	4
Fourth row to the fifth	The three to the four	sd	4
The three to the four	Oh fourth row	sd	2
Oh fourth row	All right	aa	1
Which ones would it be	That would like you re saying from here to here going to there	sd	2
That would like you re saying from here to here going to there	Uhhuh	b	2
How would you draw your little arrow to shows that	This one and that one	sd	4
This one and that one	Yeah is that it	sd	2
Yeah is that it	Is that all so that s all you want	sd	2
Is that all so that s all you want	Yeah	b	2
Do you believe that	Yeah	b	1
You all believe that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Uhhuh	b	2
No one could persuade you otherwise	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
Right	Three choose two should equal four choose two	sd	5
Three choose two should equal four choose two	Look at all the numbers are added up	sd	2
So whats four choose two plus four choose three	Four choose two plus four choose three	sd	1
Four choose two plus four choose three	That would be that would be five	sd	4
That would be that would be five	Oh five	sd	2
Oh five	Five choose	sd	2
Five choose	Five choose three	sd	2
Five choose three	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Right	b	2
Right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
I dont know if Rominas convinced	Why is it five choose three	sd	3
Yeah I dont think Jeff is either	Is this here	sd	1
Is this here	Yeah I dont really	sd	1
Yeah I dont really	Because its its always the one on the right	sd	5
Because its its always the one on the right	Because see this guy gets another topping I guess so he turns he would be a two	sd	5
Because see this guy gets another topping I guess so he turns he would be a two	Uhhuh	b	2
Uhhuh	Whatever it is in here	sd	2
Whatever it is in here	And this guy doesnt so it stays two	sd	2
And this guy doesnt so it stays two	Ah it doesnt so that s two	sd	2
Ah it doesnt so that s two	So	b	1
So	It wasn t that	sd	2
It wasn t that	Because hes moving up this bottom numbers going to change	sd	5
Because hes moving up this bottom numbers going to change	Oh all right	aa	2
Explain that one more time Michael please	Here	sd	1
Here	Um wherever this guy goes wherever this guy goes hes going to get another topping because hes moving this way	sd	5
Um wherever this guy goes wherever this guy goes hes going to get another topping because hes moving this way	So that turns it into a two	sd	2
So that turns it into a two	So this bottom numbers going to change to two	sd	2
So this bottom numbers going to change to two	This guys not going anywhere	sd	5
This guys not going anywhere	Cause the bottom number stays the same	sd	5
Cause the bottom number stays the same	So its going to be five	sd	5
So its going to be five	Because you know the next ones going to be five and it it has to be a two because You understand why you add	sd	2
Because you know the next ones going to be five and it it has to be a two because You understand why you add	All right	aa	1
All right	Good	ba	1
Good	Im with you	aa	1
Did you eat Brian	No	b	1
You can watch us	We dont get another break	sd	1
We dont get another break	I dont think you want to know what I went through	sd	1
I dont think you want to know what I went through	Well at least you got a tux	sd	1
Were glad youre here	Neither did I	sd	1
Neither did I	I didnt	sd	1
I didnt	I didnt either	sd	1
I didnt either	What happened	sd	1
What happened	What happened to my coat	sd	1
What happened to my coat	The coat is like fit for a midget	sd	1
The coat is like fit for a midget	Keep going	sd	1
Keep going	All right	aa	1
OK sure why not	OK	b	1
OK	Good	ba	1

All right	You remember	sd	1
You remember	All right were looking at were looking at this right here	sd	1
All right were looking at were looking at this right here	You guys got to pay attention to it	sd	1
Erase it better Jeff before you start because	Yeah remember and you didnt pay me back for like three months	sd	1
Yeah remember and you didnt pay me back for like three months	I had it the whole time	sd	1
I had it the whole time	Yeah but it cancelled out	sd	1
Yeah but it cancelled out	All right	b	1
All right	Say we have this row right here	sd	5
Say we have this row right here	We got um N choose 0	sd	5
We got um N choose 0	And over here we have N choose X	sd	5
And over here we have N choose X	And then over here we have N choose N	sd	5
And then over here we have N choose N	All right	aa	5
All right	Then this right here would be Oh were explaining the general addition the addition rule using this type of to fill out the triangle	sd	5
Then this right here would be Oh were explaining the general addition the addition rule using this type of to fill out the triangle	Using chooses to fill out the triangle and this here would be N choose X plus one and then N N choose X plus two and so on to whatever N equals	sd	5
Using chooses to fill out the triangle and this here would be N choose X plus one and then N N choose X plus two and so on to whatever N equals	Right there d be dot dot I didnt I didnt leave enough room	sd	5
Right there d be dot dot I didnt I didnt leave enough room	And this here would be X minus one and then	sd	5
And this here would be X minus one and then	You did that one man	sd	1
You did that one man	What	ba	1
What	Nothing	sd	1
Nothing	Thatd be X minus two and so on each way	sd	4
Thatd be X minus two and so on each way	Right	b	2
Right	So itd be that	sd	1
So itd be that	Can I see the row above that	sd	2
Can I see the row above that	And the row above this would be N minus one right	sd	2
And the row above this would be N minus one right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	Um choose zero	sd	2
Um choose zero	This again would be N N minus one choose X and then	sd	2
This again would be N N minus one choose X and then	N minus one	sd	2
N minus one	N minus one N minus one	sd	2
N minus one N minus one	Thats a one	sd	2
Thats a one	Um how do you want me to to Where do you want me to go from here	sd	3
Well you know um Brian wasnt here so you might want to give him some background to what youve been doing	Start at the beginning	sd	1
Start at the beginning	We did we worked for an hour and a half getting to this point	sd	1
We did we worked for an hour and a half getting to this point	Explaining this doing this	sd	1
Explaining this doing this	All right um	aa	1
But Brians a quick study	Thats what I am	sd	1
Thats what I am	All right	b	1
All right	We did uh this is Pascals Triangle using the choose situation	sd	4
We did uh this is Pascals Triangle using the choose situation	The whole choose thing	sd	2
The whole choose thing	Thats what this is	sd	2
Thats what this is	You know how choose works like one three three one	sd	2
You know how choose works like one three three one	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Three choose zero three choose one	sd	2
Three choose zero three choose one	One four six	sd	2
One four six	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Its all like chooses of something	sd	2
Its all like chooses of something	All right	b	1
All right	So um I dont Um how would you like to uh how do you want to do this	sd	3
So um I dont Um how would you like to uh how do you want to do this	How do you want to	qy	1
How do you want to	Were just	sd	1
Were just	Well tell him what we did	sd	1
Well tell him what we did	replacing the three in the chooses by Ns and Xs	sd	2
replacing the three in the chooses by Ns and Xs	Yeah exactly	aa	2
Yeah exactly	And rather doing like uh rather Say this is the uh	sd	1
And rather doing like uh rather Say this is the uh	If N was three	sd	2
If N was three	Yeah say if N was the third row it would be three choose zero	sd	5
Yeah say if N was the third row it would be three choose zero	That would give you one	sd	5
That would give you one	Like you know how it s one three three one	sd	5
Like you know how it s one three three one	Three choose zero gives you one	sd	5
Three choose zero gives you one	Three choose one	sd	2
Three choose one	That d be three	sd	2
That d be three	That would give you the three	sd	2
That would give you the three	The three choose two	sd	5
The three choose two	That would give you the other three	sd	5
That would give you the other three	Thats equal to three and then three choose three	sd	5
Thats equal to three and then three choose three	That equals the other one	sd	5
That equals the other one	And like thats filling out this part of the triangle and so on	sd	5
And like thats filling out this part of the triangle and so on	And thats what thats what were doing now	sd	1
And thats what thats what were doing now	We went other stuff we did we did the whole we found that equation to find out choose	sd	1
We went other stuff we did we did the whole we found that equation to find out choose	What choose means	sd	2
What choose means	Yeah we did all that	sd	1
Yeah we did all that	And choose	sd	2
And choose	But you missed out on all that	sd	1
But you missed out on all that	Thats the choose equation	sd	2
Thats the choose equation	Thats the choose equals	sd	2
Thats the choose equals	And we spent time explaining	sd	1
And we spent time explaining	Thats what we spent the bulk bulk of the thing trying to figure out how to explain that	sd	1
Thats what we spent the bulk bulk of the thing trying to figure out how to explain that	Whats that little exclamation point	sd	3

All right	It was really excited like N	sd	1
It was really excited like N	You want to know what this is	sd	2
You want to know what this is	Thats all the combinations	sd	2
Thats all the combinations	Thats minusing	ba	2
Thats minusing	You know how like theyre saying	sd	1
You know how like theyre saying	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	three choose two	sd	2
three choose two	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	We dont care about the three so thats like when the threes are switching not the twos	sd	5
We dont care about the three so thats like when the threes are switching not the twos	And thats when the twos are like in the first place and the third place and they just switch and nothing else moves	sd	5
And thats when the twos are like in the first place and the third place and they just switch and nothing else moves	So this	sd	2
So this	Its basically the same thing	sd	2
Its basically the same thing	Is this is that this over this	sv	2
Is this is that this over this	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Its N N factorial over N minus X factorial times X factorial	sd	5
Its N N factorial over N minus X factorial times X factorial	And that equals N choose X	sd	2
And that equals N choose X	Like this is when the the things we dont No Im just saying these are the things that we dont care about when they they switch and this is when the things we do care about just switch in the same place and everything stays the same	sd	5
Like this is when the the things we dont No Im just saying these are the things that we dont care about when they they switch and this is when the things we do care about just switch in the same place and everything stays the same	All right	aa	1
All right	And thats all of them	sd	2
And thats all of them	The Readers Digest version	sd	1
The Readers Digest version	Yeah	b	1
What was that Ankur	No I just said like the Readers Digest version or something	sd	1
The Readers Digest version	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So where where do you want to go with with this	sd	3
Well I want you to show me how the addition rule works in general	All right	b	1
All right	Well that s not much of a problem	sd	1
So you showed me what N minus one choose X	Go from go from go from N X and N X plus one	sd	1
Go from go from go from N X and N X plus one	Wait this is this is	sd	1
Wait this is this is	Yeah add that in terms of X	sd	4
Yeah add that in terms of X	Like below it you know what I mean	sd	1
Like below it you know what I mean	Add these two	sd	2
Add these two	What are these two going to equal	sd	3
What are these two going to equal	All right well that s gonna be	sd	1
All right well that s gonna be	We want the next	sd	1
We want the next	N plus one over	sd	2
N plus one over	N plus one over	sd	2
N plus one over	X plus one	sd	2
X plus one	X plus one	sd	2

N	Yeah I think	aa	2
Yeah I think	Uhhuh	b	2
Uhhuh	That s what these two are going to come into	sd	2
That s what these two are going to come into	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	Right	b	2
Right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And that s cause	sd	1
Just like you wrote three plus three equals six	Um that would	sd	1
Um that would	N plus just that plus that	sd	4
Why dont you do it on the side	Just N	sd	4
Just N	Oh would it be	sd	1
Oh would it be	Oh N choose X	sd	2
Oh N choose X	N choose X um plus	sd	2
N choose X um plus	Plus	sd	2
Plus	N choose X plus one	sd	2
N choose X plus one	Equals that	sd	2
Equals that	Plus one equals that right there	sd	2
Plus one equals that right there	Then well thats thats because this would be gaining an X and going into the X plus one	sd	2
Then well thats thats because this would be gaining an X and going into the X plus one	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And this would be losing an X	sd	2
And this would be losing an X	No no not losing not getting anything	sd	2
No no not losing not getting anything	Staying the same	sd	2
Staying the same	No	b	2
No	Its not getting anything	sd	2
Its not getting anything	That would be staying the same and thats	sd	2
That would be staying the same and thats	Thats yeah the plus that	sd	2
Thats yeah the plus that	is the X plus one	sd	2
is the X plus one	And the top numbers have changed because you have more	sd	5
And the top numbers have changed because you have more	Because youre adding more things	sd	5

Say it so Brian can follow it because he wasnt here for the earlier pizza discussion	He follows you can follow it	sd	2
He follows you can follow it	I can just sit in the back and watch	sd	1
Dont be easy on them Brian make them work	What what were doing is the next line of the triangle Remember how today in class you know how the other triangle was one two three that whole row there	sd	5
What what were doing is the next line of the triangle Remember how today in class you know how the other triangle was one two three that whole row there	Well thats the increase in N and then the X plus one	sd	5
Well thats the increase in N and then the X plus one	If you added another topping onto your whole	sd	5
If you added another topping onto your whole	Say were doing pizzas	sd	5
Say were doing pizzas	All right	aa	1
All right	If you add another topping onto it	sd	4
If you add another topping onto it	You know how we get the triangle and how we go one two one and add those two together	sd	2
You know how we get the triangle and how we go one two one and add those two together	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Thats what were doing right there	sd	2

Thats all were doing	We we were explaining why you add	sd	2
We we were explaining why you add	All right keep going	sd	1
All right keep going	And why you do it is it cause when you add another topping like onto it this one	sd	5
And why you do it is it cause when you add another topping like onto it this one	Say the toppings were one and zero	sd	5
Say the toppings were one and zero	Uhhuh	b	2
Uhhuh	If it gets a topping thats why it goes up to the X plus one	sd	5
If it gets a topping thats why it goes up to the X plus one	And since it doesnt get anything itll stay the same	sd	5
And since it doesnt get anything itll stay the same	And in this one its staying the same right	sd	5
And in this one its staying the same right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And thats why its going there	sd	5
And thats why its going there	Like saying thats the zero	sd	5
Like saying thats the zero	OK	b	1
OK	And going to there	sd	4
And going to there	Make sense	aa	2
Make sense	Yes	aa	2
Yes	It actually does	sd	2

Now that that s really really very frightening	Yeah	b	1
Is that foreboding	I guess	aa	1
I wonder if there s a way of simplifying it	Yeah you could  that s simplifying	aa	1
Yeah you could  that s simplifying	Yeah that s that s pretty	ba	1
See that N plus one parenthesis that Michael just put there	Yeah	b	1
Suppose you distributed that minus one	So you want all right so All right	sd	1
So you want all right so All right	Why would you want to do that	sv	3
Why would you want to do that	So distributing say over there right	sd	5
So distributing say over there right	You d have you d have N plus one minus X minus one factorial	sd	5
You d have you d have N plus one minus X minus one factorial	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	Um that would be in in parenthesis	sd	4
Um that would be in in parenthesis	Oh yeah yeah there you go	aa	2
Oh yeah yeah there you go	And then well that	sd	1
And then well that	Why dont you get another piece of paper	sd	1
Why dont you get another piece of paper	So all right so itd be N plus one factorial divided by um N plus one in parentheses minus X minus one factorial	sd	5
So all right so itd be N plus one factorial divided by um N plus one in parentheses minus X minus one factorial	All right	aa	1
All right	And then well thats thats pretty much all you can do there	sd	1
And then well thats thats pretty much all you can do there	Then X plus one factorial so you could actually can you can cancel out	sd	5
Then X plus one factorial so you could actually can you can cancel out	Can you cancel that out	sd	5
Can you cancel that out	The X minus X minus one and the X plus one	sd	5
Not right not now necessarily but um	Yeah can you I mean can you cross out factorials or is that the first factorial on the bottom of the one all the way to the right	sd	4
Yeah can you I mean can you cross out factorials or is that the first factorial on the bottom of the one all the way to the right	Does that affect thats affecting the N plus one too so can you are you allowed to cross out like that	sv	4
Does that affect thats affecting the N plus one too so can you are you allowed to cross out like that	Cross these both out	sd	4
What do you all think	Well can we throw in numbers and see	sd	1
Well can we throw in numbers and see	Would we be able to cross out the N plus ones	sd	4
Would we be able to cross out the N plus ones	Well then what are you left with	sd	3
Well then what are you left with	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	It doesnt	sd	2
It doesnt	Factorial divided by factorial	sd	2

You know that	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Shes talking about simplifying and you just like you know put that negative in there and it would be just N minus X	sd	5
Shes talking about simplifying and you just like you know put that negative in there and it would be just N minus X	Wheres this at	sd	3
Wheres this at	Right at N minus minus that one right there	sd	2
Right at N minus minus that one right there	The one all the way to the side	sd	2
The one all the way to the side	Oh yeah and then the all right so you so you do that N minus X factorial	sd	2
Oh yeah and then the all right so you so you do that N minus X factorial	That	aa	1
That	That could be	sd	1
That could be	N minus	sd	2
N minus	Yeah exactly	b	2

Yeah	Yeah because that it would be You got the plus one	sd	2
Yeah because that it would be You got the plus one	Im just wondering	sd	1
Im just wondering	Wouldnt you wouldnt that equal N plus one minus X minus one	sd	2
Wouldnt you wouldnt that equal N plus one minus X minus one	Yes then the plus one and the minus one	sd	2
Yes then the plus one and the minus one	Are gone	sd	2
Are gone	So it would be N minus X factorial	sd	2
So it would be N minus X factorial	N minus X so	sd	2
N minus X so	Itd be N minus X factorial um times X plus one factorial	sd	5
Itd be N minus X factorial um times X plus one factorial	Right	b	2
Right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	A little simpler	aa	2

It would be N minus one	N minus X minus one factorial	sd	2
N minus X minus one factorial	No	b	2
No	No itll still be the same number	sd	2
No itll still be the same number	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And itll be X plus one	sd	2
And itll be X plus one	You want us to do that do that too	sd	1
You want us to do that do that too	Or dont even bother	sd	1
Or dont even bother	Factorial	sd	2
Um you know of course the next thing to do is to learn how to do the algebra of factorials so that you indeed could do the addition	the factorial	sd	4
As	Um six factorial over	sd	4
Six factorial	Three fact four factorial times two factorial	sd	4
Times two factorial right	Mm hm	sd	1
Six times five	Times onetwenty	sd	4
Times onetwenty	Thirty	ba	2
Thirty	Yeah	b	2
Is that okay	Thats thats simplifying is great then you can	sv	4
But can I do that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then you could cross out the four factorials and	sd	4
And then you could cross out the four factorials and	Oh	b	1
Oh then I can cross out the four factorials	Oh all right that makes sense	sd	1
Right	So you just get thirty divided by you get thirty divided by two	sd	4
Yeah look at all the time that will save you in an SAT question	Thatd be big	sd	1
But but if you think about this	She broke she broke it down farther	sd	2
She broke she broke it down farther	Oh yeah she just	b	2
Oh yeah she just	Like rather than say you have six factorial	sd	2
Like rather than say you have six factorial	Mm hm	sd	2
Mm hm	She broke it down until she got a number that she got that she wanted	sd	2
She broke it down until she got a number that she got that she wanted	She had two numbers	sd	2
She had two numbers	That matched the number on the bottom	sd	2
That matched the number on the bottom	All right	aa	1
All right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Then you end up like with the two factorial and then cross out and thats thirty over the two factorial and thats two	sd	5
Then you end up like with the two factorial and then cross out and thats thirty over the two factorial and thats two	So its just fifteen	sd	5
So its just fifteen	But then it would probably be even longer than that	sd	2
But then it would probably be even longer than that	Cause if N is a big number	sd	2
Does it matter	youd have to write you would have to write N times N minus one times N minus	sd	4
Okay do you think I can make a problem that is so hard that even Ankur and Brian and Amy Lynn can t do it	Yes	b	1
Yes	I think there is somewhere in the world a problem like that	sd	1
I think there is somewhere in the world a problem like that	Maybe not here but somewhere in the world	sd	1
Maybe not here but somewhere in the world	Every single one	sd	1
Every single one	But do you have it right now	sd	1
But do you have it right now	Why should we try one that nobody could understand	sd	1
Why should we try one that nobody could understand	Hey there might be one that nobody can do	sd	1
Hey there might be one that nobody can do	If you write it in like Japanese or something and then	sd	1
If you write it in like Japanese or something and then	What if that number was hum	sd	1
What if that number was hum	Oh unless of course the two numbers don t have the same kind of multiples	sd	4
Oh unless of course the two numbers don t have the same kind of multiples	Right here	aa	2
Right here	The problem right here	aa	2
The problem right here	Yeah this one would work you know that one would work	sd	1
Yeah this one would work you know that one would work	We can do that but I know one that we cannot do	sd	1
We can do that but I know one that we cannot do	Okay I know that	sd	1

I just didn t know it until you guys said it	I waited till everyone is quiet	sd	1
I waited till everyone is quiet	I know but I didn t want to spoil your chance	sd	1
There is one other thing I d like to do if we had time	What	ba	1

You can keep us from gym please	Keep us from gym	sd	1
Keep us from gym	I don t have my gym clothes and I m going to get a zero for not being I m unprepared	sd	1
Somebody say the secret again to make sure we all agree on what it is	Oh I know	aa	1
Oh I know	I know	sd	1
I know	Because like if you add the two numbers together you ll get the first number	sd	5
Because like if you add the two numbers together you ll get the first number	Yeah so it would be like ten plus ten or whatever it is and then if you multiply the two numbers together you ll get ninetysix am I right	sd	5
Yeah so it would be like ten plus ten or whatever it is and then if you multiply the two numbers together you ll get ninetysix am I right	Yes	b	2

He says nobody here can do it	Neither can you Mil so what are you talking about	sd	1
Neither can you Mil so what are you talking about	If you think about it	sd	1
One might work	The only numbers that can work are one and seventeen	sd	4
Because we are looking for divisors of this right	The seventeen is lower than the nineteen	sd	4
And one certainly divides seventeen and what other number might work	One and seventeen	sd	4
What happens when you try those	I can do one	sd	1
I can do one	I ll do one	sd	1
How much is that	If that nineteen was an eighteen if that nineteen was an eighteen it would have worked	sd	5
If that nineteen was an eighteen if that nineteen was an eighteen it would have worked	It would have worked	sd	2
Yeah one minus nineteen is negative eighteen right	If nineteen was eighteen it would have worked	sd	5
Can somebody think of a way to multiply seventeen by seventeen	Dur	sd	1

It says 10 Its supposed to be 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 3 plus 10	I mean 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 10 plus 9 equals 82	sd	5
All right good morning everybody	Good morning	sd	1
I heard that Joel you were about to say something	No no no nothing	sd	1
Only one person can move the chair okay	Thanks	b	1
Youre welcome	To do the calculations you have to find  calculations so that you can find this measure of the straw	sd	4
Yes	Madam but and when is not	sd	1
Also observe your instructions a little bit eh	Madam can we already cut it	sd	1
Of course you can already cut it yes	Madam Madam can we	sd	1
Have you found the best position	Eh	sd	1
Eh	And if its wrong	sd	1
In case its wrong you take another piece and then you use the rest of the straw	Eh its forty point five	sd	4
Eh its forty point five	Eh yes	aa	1
Eh yes	You do it that way	sv	1
You do it that way	Put it a little	sd	1
Put it a little	You measure forty	sd	4
You measure forty	Forty point five	sd	2
Forty point five	Well well this is the length	sd	4
Look you have instructions eh that are already given	Ah already	sd	1
Try to cut it and then if it doesnt work youll take another piece of straw and try	We only cut one piece	sd	1
Find the longest straw that you can place in your box mhm yes	Madam like this its longer	sd	4
Madam like this its longer	calculate it like this	sd	4
So did you already cut the straw	No	b	1
Look you have already got the the instructions	Yes yes but we have already found	sd	1
Yes yes but we have already found	We have already found it	sd	1
Complete the sheet	But dont we have to do the calculations	sd	1
But dont we have to do the calculations	We weve got it	sd	1
You have inserted cut and measured it	Yes	b	1
Then now you can try with the calculations to check if this length corresponds to what you have measured	the diagonal like this so	sd	4
So complete Here with your situation with your straw you have the box number two and you put it do it again here	Ah we have to do	sd	1
And then start doing this call me to have a look at it when youve finished	Like this Madam	sd	1
Now have you found the straw and have you measured it	Yes	b	1
Insert the straw What if I so in your opinion what is the longest straw laying in the box	No no shorter	sd	4
No no shorter	Shorter	sd	2
One thats shorter	Like this	sd	1
If not Ill give you another straw if you need one	We have finished	sd	1
We have finished	We have finished	sd	1
Everybody has his own	That means together	sd	1
So in a few words with the straw inserted like this in reality it isnt of any use that the box is high it could also be a box thats very flat	Yes good	ba	1
Its already very flat yours is really	Yes	b	1
Try to think about if you utilize the fact that this one is high	You can do it like this	sd	4
You can do it like this	Place it like this	sd	2
Place it like this	Raise it raise it	sd	2
Raise it raise it	Like this yes	sd	4
Like this yes	No	b	2
No	Its not like that perhaps here	sd	2
Its not like that perhaps here	Like this	sd	4
This distance here	How do you do it	qy	3
Like you said	like this	sd	1
Try to cut it	Be careful	aa	1
Yes without forcing it	Eh  like this	sd	1
Now how can I calculate the length of this straw	No you do it here	sd	4
Where are the instructions	Here	sd	1
Then you know how long it is how wide it is how high it is	we find	sd	1
Now reason within the group explain it to them	Madam in what sense are these calculations	sd	1
Have you found the longest straw	Yes yes	b	1
So then how is it	Like this	sd	4
Without bending it eh you cant bend the straw	We did it that way	sd	1
You havent found it yet try to thin try to place the straw into it without bending it eh	No	b	1
No	First	sd	1
First	Once  and once here	sd	1
Once  and once here	Because its written here	sd	5
What is the position	Like this	sd	4
Now are you calculating its length	Yes	b	1
How do you do it	We measure	sd	4
Now you have to calculate the length of the straw	With the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate	sd	4
With the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate	And because we placed it oblique	sd	5
But try to cut the straw corresponding to the diagonal and insert the straw corresponding to the diagonal	Its from there to there to here	sd	4
Its from there to there to here	Like this we see	sd	4
Like this we see	Let it go	sd	1
Let it go	Good cut it down here	sd	1
Good cut it down here	No	sd	1
But it I know	Ah but now if I have this and this if I have this and this Ill find it	sd	5
Ah but now if I have this and this if I have this and this Ill find it	I I I know that you need to do the the the the the	sd	1
I I I know that you need to do the the the the the	But no but because this one here is practically the diagonal if you do her above  thats it	sd	5
But no but because this one here is practically the diagonal if you do her above  thats it	No its right	aa	1
Listen to Boris and then try to observe this sheet and complete it	Okay listen	sd	1
Okay listen	Eh the diagonal here	sd	4
Mhm yes	Right	b	1
Or as we said Instead of writing this I can write	This	sd	1
After some time it seems to be the same thing	Only that	sd	1
Its quite a lot wider eh	But indeed its right	sd	1
And then theres the and then there is the	Ah already because its longer	sd	5
Afterwards there is the height which is different but the afterwards we will see that its right	But its right indeed	sd	1
Its correct eh what you are calculating but Id like to see if you can shorten the calculation also write the unit eh	Madam we have found it	sd	1
Found	Well we used we have the Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
Mhm yes	that we know  and now we got	sd	1
Try afterwards to calculate those too the diagonals that you got from the other groups	Because here	sd	1
By doing these calculations what did you apply	The Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
Yes	Will you write it or shall I write it	sd	1
Will you write it or shall I write it	Madam	b	1
In your exercise book eh	Do we have to fill in all of them	sd	1
When you have finished yours continue filling in from the other groups too yes	in scribble or do we have	sd	1
There is the box zero the bo and start doing the calculations like this for the others seeing what the others found with their boxes	We are inexact	sd	4
You are inexact what do you mean	Well we have practically found that the longest straw is this	sd	4
Well we have practically found that the longest straw is this	The diagonal from here to here	sd	2
The diagonal from here to here	Yes	b	2
Yes	We found it with the diagonal	sd	4
We found it with the diagonal	From here to here	sd	2
From here to here	From here to here	sd	2
From here to here	Mine worked but the straw is this other one	sd	4
Mine worked but the straw is this other one	Its logical because if you put it from here to here it will get longer	sd	5
It means that what you calculated isnt the length of the straw	So we what	sd	1
But its only the diagonal from the box from from the circumference of the base from the box from the rectangle lets say the base	We have to find from here to here many	sd	4
Mhm yes Use this the measure you have already found	Thirtynine point three	sd	4
So now is this one here the right one	Yes	b	1
Also cut the one placed on the base	Ah that way	ba	1
Ah that way	That way	aa	1
Yes with the but dont the straw after no yes mhm yes	Cut	sd	1
Cut	This	sd	1
This	Ah that	ba	1
It gets placed in the same	Like this	sd	1
Like this	In the same trajectory	sd	4
Now here you have already calculated	This	sd	1
This	We calculated this	sd	1
Now observe how to calculate the other	Using the Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
Using the Pythagorean theorem	Using the Pythagorean theorem	sd	2
Using the Pythagorean theorem	So its thirtynine point six squared	sd	4
So its thirtynine point six squared	Plus	sd	2
Plus	Plus	sd	2
Plus	You have to find the hypotenuse	sd	4
You have to find the hypotenuse	Plus twelve	sd	4
Plus twelve	this one  here	sd	1
this one  here	And then you have to do this plus this	sd	4
And then you have to do this plus this	Ah its true	sd	1
Afterwards you can also solve them underneath it	Ah but	sd	1
No	But here eh here	sd	1
But here eh here	But its right	sd	1
Afterwards write it also here but start afterwards write it again	Madam but here  do we have to write the same things like here	sd	1
Done	Yes	b	1
Yes	Madam	b	1
Have you completed the transparency	Yes	b	1
Yes	We didnt get as far as finding what  fast  the fast calculations	sd	1
It isnt because youre slow but you can do it with a single calculation eh	Even faster	sd	1
Even faster	Madam its true that here  the Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
You square it plus square this	Yes	b	1
Isnt it like I told you yesterday	Ah right	b	1
Ah right	To already use the	sd	1
I and then in reality instead of writing this	Eh but why we	sd	1
Eh but why we	We have to take the square root of this	sd	4
Try to think about what I have to write	Madam do we now have to check the boxes with the others	sd	1
Tell me	We have found it	sd	1
Tell me	Ive been thinking	sd	1
Have you finished have you completed here you write me here you havent completed yet eh	Ah do we also have to do this too	sd	1
Mhm yes	Here	sd	1
Number three you can you only have to fill in the same thing	Madam	sd	1
Yes	All the calculations	sd	1
Mhm yes	Madam by doing the question we got a result that doesnt	sd	4
Well I think there will be something wrong	Were done	sd	1
Complete case number two with your solution	Yes	b	1
Shall I leave it here	Yes	b	1
Yes	But here you can directly	sd	1
What did you apply to find these measurements	The Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
And here write down the calculations of your box too eh	Ive written it here	sd	1
The I Your I is only this one isnt it	The hypotenuse which	sd	4
Draw it in and write the I	No but then you wont understand well if I write	sd	1
No do it in colors	Eh yes	aa	1
Call it straw or call it	Is diagonal of the base okay	sd	4
Ready Lucia	Yes yes yes	aa	1
Do you still need the box	No	b	1
Have you finished yours eh	Yes	b	1
So in the transparency you have the box number zero	Madam do we have to color them	sd	1
Madam do we have to color them	All of the	sd	1
Yes yes	Madam but	sd	1
What	If weve made mistakes with the calculations	sd	1
Complete it here with your calculations	Here	b	1
Then if you dont need it any more bring you box scissors tape measure to the table	Look how easy it is Only changing all the measurements	sd	1
Also the straws are to be brought here eh not to be played with	Madam	b	1
Madam	Here I have this  has this	sd	1
Take the first calculation	Eh but	sd	1
If you have already filled in the transparency no Ill bring it to you now eh to fill in	You need to	sd	1
Now you do the same calculations with the other boxes	We take	sd	1
Bring the material over there now Ill give you the transparency to complete	Do we have to do it in red	sd	1
No in blue	No not this	sd	1
No not this	Its this	sd	1
Its this	Yes	sd	1
Yes	And now how should I do	sd	1
Tell me	Is it right like this	sd	1
Have you done yours	Yes	b	1
But it gives you a straw of 880 centimeters	Eh yes	aa	1
This here	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	No this	aa	1
No this	Here inside	sd	1
Theres something that doesnt work	We can try to do the calculations again	sd	1
We can try to do the calculations again	Try to do this piece here	sd	1
Try to do this piece here	It equals 48	sd	4
Marisa what did you do	Okay thirtyeight point five squared plus 25 squared  to find this diagonal here	sd	4
Mhm yes	Now its more	sd	4
Having a rectangular triangle	Right angle side right angle side	sd	4
Which is the hypotenuse	The hypotenuse is this one	sd	4
Eh yes	And these are the other two sides	sd	4
But this triangle here	No	b	1
No	This is a side and this is the other	sd	4
This is a side and this is the other	This is a side that is a side and this is the hypotenuse	sd	4
So if you have found this you already have calculated it	Yes	b	1
Its 55	Squared plus  16 squared and then extracting the root of everything	sd	4
Do you agree	Mhm yes	aa	2
Mhm yes	We have found it	sd	1
We have found it	Is it right like this	sd	1
Is it right like this	I get an expression	sd	1
And where can I simplify again	No	b	1
Are you done with the transparency	Yes	b	1
Have you already completed the transparency	ah no the transparency not yet	sd	1
You have to complete with are you doing number three or number four	Three	sd	1
Found	Eh yes I think so	aa	1
In the meanwhile Andrea	Madam may I ask you	sd	1
Go on put it inside Claudio	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Assio its your pen	sd	1
No mine	No why	sd	1
Sqaure this plus fourteen point seven squared root	Ah I can use the properties of powers	sd	4
Be careful I squar	Plus eh you cant use the properties of powers	sd	4
Here is the square root now the sum then extract the root I square	But first	sd	1
First we extract the root then we square it	Ah so you can take away the root its this	sd	4
Which root can I take away	This	sd	4
This	No	b	2
No	This because squar taking away the square root and then squaring it isnt of any use	sd	5
This because squar taking away the square root and then squaring it isnt of any use	But the	sd	1
Here I extract the root of it all and then I square it again	Dividing by two doesnt make sense	sd	4
Have you done	Here we have to do it in the simplified way or	sd	4
Have you measured it	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
The result you found	The same thing that we wrote down here	sd	1
Yes exactly	Now here you extend the same scheme	sd	1
Yes and afterwards try to do what the others have done with the other other boxes	Okay	b	1
And pay attention extract the root but you have to extract what else	Eh	sd	1
Eh	I told you	aa	1
Why do you take the box	To do the faster thing	sd	1
What did you apply in solid geometry	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	The Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
Finished	square root direct	sd	4
square root direct	And that without eh without	sd	1
The direct square root what what is that	What is the direct square root	sd	3
What is the direct square root	Is the  and then you have to square it and immediately extract the root	sd	4
Is the  and then you have to square it and immediately extract the root	This  the last time	sd	1
This  the last time	Ah	aa	1
Ah	Do you remember	qy	1
But instead of doing two calculations try to see if you could do it with a single one	Its enough to do	sd	1
Its enough to do	Put it a bit  below	sd	1
Try to write it	Lets do it here go on	sd	1
Lets do it here go on	What	sd	3
What you just told me now	Now here Im going to write the same	sd	1
What have we applied in solid geometry that we havent ever done Neluca	The Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
You had box number	Eh one	aa	1
Do it at the blackboard	Yes	b	1
Yes	So first eh in practice we put together the two calculations	sd	4
So first eh in practice we put together the two calculations	Do I have to write down the two calculations here	sd	1
So observe the difference between the written calculation on the overhead and the calculation that she is writing now on the blackboard	In practice we put together eh the first calculation that that we have eh we have put together the two calculationseh but we simplify because in practice the calculation was like this at the beginning	sd	5
In practice we put together eh the first calculation that that we have eh we have put together the two calculationseh but we simplify because in practice the calculation was like this at the beginning	Only extracting the root and then squaring it isnt of any use	sd	5
Only extracting the root and then squaring it isnt of any use	So we simplified we we took away the root and we squared it	sd	5
The result	The result is the same	sd	4
Yes Im raising it now	Thanks	b	1
The overhead projector doesnt work well	But can we	sd	1
Have you finished	Yes	b	1
Are they correct	Yes yes	b	1
You dont have to do the other dont  start doing this afterwards in case well see next time to to work on it again	Well I didnt under well I didnt understa I didnt understand  how to arrange	sd	3
This number here you transferred here	Mhm yes	aa	1
Mhm yes	Yes	b	1
And I used that to find this number here	Yes	b	1
I did this which in reality was this	This	sd	1
This	Mhm yes	aa	1
Instead of writing this number I could write this calculation	Mhm yes	aa	1
I can write this squared plus this squared	And then	sd	3
plus 166 which would be 13 squared	okay Ill do it that way	sd	1
But its the same as you told me last time  is 2000	Do you remember that you told me already last time that there	sd	1
Eh	What am I doing wrong	sd	3
What am I doing wrong	I should extract the root	sd	3
I should extract the root	Ah its true	sd	2
the result down here if you extract the root	And the root	sd	4
Boris got it	Yes	b	1
Is it right now	Yes	b	1
Yes	But down here	sd	1
But down here	Yes	b	1

Sarah move over a little bit	I cant get my chair in	sd	1
I cant get my chair in	We have this now	sd	1
We have this now	We gonna were gonna write	sd	1
We gonna were gonna write	Ooo good	ba	1
Ooo good	We re going to do ten	sd	1
We re going to do ten	Let me see what you have	sd	1
Let me see what you have	No dont give her anything	sd	1
No dont give her anything	What will they think we re doing	sd	1
What will they think we re doing	See look we re going to do ten	sd	1
See look we re going to do ten	We re gonna copy	sd	1
Show me over here	Dont ask	sd	1
Dont ask	This is um I did the probability	sd	4
This is um I did the probability	next one	sd	1
next one	To help figure out why player B had an advantage	sd	4
What do you think	And player B Player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	sd	4
Can you tell me what these numbers mean over here	Alright	b	1
Alright	Okay	b	1
Okay	These are the dice numbers	sd	4
These are the dice numbers	Like numbers that can be rolled on the two die and one s not there cause you can t roll one	sd	4
Like numbers that can be rolled on the two die and one s not there cause you can t roll one	And these are the number of times that number  s rolled	sd	4
Okay	Um see um	sd	1
Um see um	Two is only rolled once	sd	4
Two is only rolled once	Three is rolled twice	sd	4
Three is rolled twice	Four is rolled three times	sd	4
Okay so two is rolled how many times	Once	aa	4
Three is rolled two times	Three is rolled twice	sd	4
Three is rolled twice	And four is rolled	sd	1
And six	Four times	sd	4
Four times	Six is five times and seven is six times	sd	4
Six is five times and seven is six times	There are like six combinations like you know	sd	4
So why do you who has the advantage are you saying	Um Player B	sd	5
Um Player B	Because player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	sd	5
Because player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	Even though Player A has one um more number Player B still has the more commonly rolled	sd	5
Even though Player A has one um more number Player B still has the more commonly rolled	Like player A only has the numbers that only have like one combination two combinations you know	sd	5
Like player A only has the numbers that only have like one combination two combinations you know	Whereas player B has the numbers with like the six combinations and the five combination	sd	5
So how did you think of doing it this way Stephanie	Alright well what happened was I was playing the game with my dad	sd	1
Mhmm	And my dad asked me what I was going to do	sd	1
And my dad asked me what I was going to do	And I said I wasnt sure that d I d prol I have to prove that player B has more of an like an advantage over player A but I wasnt really sure if he did because player A had more numbers than player B	sd	5
And I said I wasnt sure that d I d prol I have to prove that player B has more of an like an advantage over player A but I wasnt really sure if he did because player A had more numbers than player B	And he asked me how many numbers could be rolled	sd	1
Mhmm	And I told him	sd	1
And I told him	And he asked how many times can they be rolled	sd	1
And he asked how many times can they be rolled	And I m like I don t know	sd	1
And I m like I don t know	So he was like why dont you show me	sd	1
So he was like why dont you show me	And so then I made  we made this	sd	1
OK tell me about this	Alright	b	1
Alright	This is another form of this	sd	1
This is another form of this	And actually this is harder to follow	sd	1
And actually this is harder to follow	This is the same thing only without the dots	sd	4
That s interesting	Alright	b	1
Do you want to sit down	Oh sure	aa	1
Come on over here on the side that s where I can see you	Alright	b	1
Alright	What this is is this is um these are both dice	sd	4
What this is is this is um these are both dice	This is dice number one and this is dice number two	sd	4
Okay	Alright	b	1
Alright	Now the number two can be rolled once	sd	4
Mhm	The number three can be rolled twice	sd	4
How is that	And it shows you down here this is maybe OK the number two can be rolled once	sd	4
And it shows you down here this is maybe OK the number two can be rolled once	The number three can be wait hold on this one  s easier to follow	sd	1
The number three can be wait hold on this one  s easier to follow	Yeah wait here the number two can be rolled once	sd	4
Mhmm	Number three can be rolled twice	sd	4
What are the two ways	Umm	sd	1
Umm	Two and one and one and two	sd	4
Okay	The number thr the number four can be rolled three times	sd	4
Mhmm	The number five can be rolled four times	sd	4
Mhmm	Number six can be rolled five times	sd	5
Number six can be rolled five times	Number seven can be rolled six times	sd	5
Number seven can be rolled six times	Number eight can be rolled five times	sd	5
Number eight can be rolled five times	Number nine can be rolled four times	sd	5
Number nine can be rolled four times	Number ten can be rolled three times	sd	5
Number ten can be rolled three times	Number eleven can be two times and number twelve can be rolled one time	sd	5
You can tell me what they are	Yeah	b	1
So nine can you tell me what nine is for example	Sure	b	1
Sure	Nine can be rolled with wait let me show you that one on here	sd	1
Nine can be rolled with wait let me show you that one on here	No okay	aa	1
No okay	Nine can be rolled with six wait OK six and three	sd	4
OK	Five and four	sd	4
OK	Wait OK	sd	1
Wait OK	I showed five and four	sd	4
OK	And three and six	sd	4
And three and six	And yeah thats it	aa	1
So so whats your theory then about this	Well theres a  okay	sd	1
Well theres a  okay	Theory is that player two player B has more of an advantage even though it is a game of luck	sd	5
Theory is that player two player B has more of an advantage even though it is a game of luck	No way you could change it so it s not a game of luck	sd	5
No way you could change it so it s not a game of luck	No matter what you do it s gonna be a game of luck	sd	5
But if you wanted to win would you would you want to be player A or player B	I wanna be Player B	sd	4
But that you re saying that doesnt guarantee you win	That does it s not a sure win	sd	4
That does it s not a sure win	It doesn t guarantee it but it gives you a little more of a chance	sd	4
I wonder	How much more how much	sd	1
How much more how much	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats the other thing	sv	1
Thats the other thing	Um I played five games with my dad	sd	1
OK	And the first game this is player B and this is player A	sd	5
And the first game this is player B and this is player A	It was ten to nothing	sd	5
It was ten to nothing	And the second game it was ten to three player B won	sd	5
And the second game it was ten to three player B won	The third game it was nine to ten and Player A won	sd	5
Oh really	The fourth the fourth game player B won ten to five	sd	5
The fourth the fourth game player B won ten to five	And the fifth game player B won ten to six	sd	5
Now does it surprise you that player A won one time here	Well it surprises well	sd	1
But player A won one time out of five	Yeah player B A won	sd	1
And when A lost the scores were far	I figured that if A was going to win the scores would be close because of the way the numbers are like together	sd	5
I figured that if A was going to win the scores would be close because of the way the numbers are like together	But but when player B won the numbers were like split apart so it s weird	sd	5
But but when player B won the numbers were like split apart so it s weird	You dont know it s like um just coincidence or you know	sd	5
You dont know it s like um just coincidence or you know	It s like	sd	1
OK	Its not	sd	1

OK	Oh that s another  i	sd	1
Oh that s another  i	You make an  I  over there and you got an exclamation point	sd	1
Did you like the problem	Yes	b	1
Yes	We re gonna market the game	sd	1
My my question is that did you change your mind about what you originally thought	Yes	b	1
But how many of you changed your mind about what you thought after you started playing it	I don t know	sd	3
OK so tell me in what way that happened	Jeff and I thought that	sd	1
Jeff and I thought that	Well Jeff and I thought that the game was pretty fair at first but then when we started playing we realized that player B had a little bit more of a an advantage	sd	5
Well Jeff and I thought that the game was pretty fair at first but then when we started playing we realized that player B had a little bit more of a an advantage	We started to break it up more into the numbers than just playing the game	sd	5
We started to break it up more into the numbers than just playing the game	And then we sorta got like we came to the we figured out when you go inside the numbers you find a lot more about	sd	5
You want to tell	First we explain this	sd	1
First we explain this	And then this	sd	1
And then this	This is the new game this explains why	sd	1
Did you change your mind	That s this is the basic	sd	4
That s this is the basic	This is how we went inside the numbers	sd	4
This is how we went inside the numbers	And those out of the sixteen fifteen times player B won	sd	2
And those out of the sixteen fifteen times player B won	And player A only player A only won once	sd	2
Yes	I thought win because it more	sd	4
OK did you all hear what Mike said	No	b	1
Again Mike please	I thought A was gonna win cause it has more numbers than player B	sd	5
I saw some of the papers some other people guessing A would win but I was wondering why	At first	sd	4
You thought so too Michelle	I don t remember what I thought	sd	1
I don t remember what I thought	Really but like it it make it s weird though because um player A could have two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and B can only have twelve but B could still has a chance to win	sd	5
Really but like it it make it s weird though because um player A could have two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and B can only have twelve but B could still has a chance to win	And that s what s weird about it	sd	5
And that s what s weird about it	Because like it s just it s however the luck is going	sd	5
You thought about it before you played the game	I wouldn t need much skill at this game	sd	4
I wouldn t need much skill at this game	You need skill	sd	4
You need skill	This you just have to roll the dice	sd	4
Brian	I just knew it wasn t fair	sd	4
Which way did you think it was unfair though	I think that player B had an advantage	sd	4
Why did you think that	Because just this is why this is what not first cause I didn t really think anything at first but then later like because player A they had like the first three beginning numbers and they re hard to get because like the only other like no combinations like one or two and they had the last three which only have like three and two	sd	5
Because just this is why this is what not first cause I didn t really think anything at first but then later like because player A they had like the first three beginning numbers and they re hard to get because like the only other like no combinations like one or two and they had the last three which only have like three and two	And player B had like all the middle numbers and you re like more combinations	sd	5
And player B had like all the middle numbers and you re like more combinations	So that s what I thought	sd	1
Stepanie what did you think	I remembered hearing um I don t remember what I thought but I remembered hearing um a first thing and I think I saw this too	sd	1
I remembered hearing um I don t remember what I thought but I remembered hearing um a first thing and I think I saw this too	That um um player A had had player A had six numbers	sd	5
That um um player A had had player A had six numbers	Player A has more of an advantage	sd	5
Player A has more of an advantage	And then when you got into it more that player B had the better numbers to roll because as you started playing and it s like wait a minute probably player B is winning	sd	5
And then when you got into it more that player B had the better numbers to roll because as you started playing and it s like wait a minute probably player B is winning	And it was because player B had the like the better	sd	5
And it was because player B had the like the better	Yeah the more chances of hitting it than player A	sd	2
Yeah the more chances of hitting it than player A	Mhmm	aa	2
Did you any any theory before you started playng	I thought that B would win cause they had like the middle numbers	sd	5
OK	Like the same thing Brian said	sd	2
Like the same thing Brian said	Cause B had the like the middle numbers and A only had like one and twelve and I mean like two and twelve	sd	5
Cause B had the like the middle numbers and A only had like one and twelve and I mean like two and twelve	And they re not that commonly rolled	sd	5
Did you have any ideas before you started	Like the same thing Brian said	sd	2
What about you Matt what do you think	I th I thought it was the same way Steph said	sd	2
I th I thought it was the same way Steph said	Like I thought in the beginning that you that player player A has more numbers than player B	sd	5
Like I thought in the beginning that you that player player A has more numbers than player B	Player A  s gonna win but then player B is always winning	sd	5
Magdalena	That I thought that player A is gonna win cause there s more numbers but player B won	sd	5
You thought it was fair at first	Yeah	b	1
Now I wanna know you have a theory and now you think if you wanted to win the game who would you like to be	B	b	4
Can you give some insight into the advantage of B and even tell me a little bit more about the kind of advantage	Um I think B has the advantage cause B has like the numbers that a lot dice game those kind of numbers that like twelve or eleven they didn t get seven or sixes	sd	5
Um I think B has the advantage cause B has like the numbers that a lot dice game those kind of numbers that like twelve or eleven they didn t get seven or sixes	Or eights nines	sd	5
Why is that	Uh because they have ah like they have different um pairs that can add up to the numbers	sd	5
Uh because they have ah like they have different um pairs that can add up to the numbers	Like um six three and three or um four and two	sd	5
Well three you can get how many ways	One	aa	4
And what s that way	Two and one	sd	4
And she can get six by	Two and four three and three	sd	4
Two and four three and three	Five and one	sd	4
Do you all agree with that	No	b	2
Ankur doesn t agree with you	We got a chart	sd	1
OK Milin	I say I say from three there s two and one and one and two because two is on one die and two is on the other die and one is on the one die one is also on the other die	sd	5
I say I say from three there s two and one and one and two because two is on one die and two is on the other die and one is on the one die one is also on the other die	Yeah but say you can just break the one down and say you can switch it	sd	2
Yeah but say you can just break the one down and say you can switch it	We re not playing with the cards anymore	sd	1
We re not playing with the cards anymore	What card	sd	1
What card	Well that that s how the beginning part w that was our second problem	sd	1
Well that that s how the beginning part w that was our second problem	Now I m lost	sd	3
Now I m lost	Cause you can have two and one with one on this side and one on this side or you can have one on this die wherever it is	sd	5
Cause you can have two and one with one on this side and one on this side or you can have one on this die wherever it is	And one on this die	sd	2
And one on this die	There s two different ways to get it	sd	2
There s two different ways to get it	It s still the same number	sd	2
It s still the same number	Check the chart out	sd	1
Romina what do you think	There are different diagrams	sd	4
There are different diagrams	But it s like not the same thing	sd	2
But it s like not the same thing	It s like saying two plus one and one plus two	sd	2
It s like saying two plus one and one plus two	There there s still the same	sd	2
There there s still the same	Different combinations	sd	2
Different combinations	Right here	sd	2
Right here	There s still the numbers on the dice you can get	sd	2
There s still the numbers on the dice you can get	And these are how many times that can come up	sd	2
And these are how many times that can come up	That doesn t make a difference the same thing	sd	2
That doesn t make a difference the same thing	Equals the same thing	sd	2
Equals the same thing	Equals six	sd	2
Equals six	Six equals six	aa	2
Six equals six	The probability	sd	2
The probability	And that high	sd	2
And Jeff can come up	I don t have to come up	sd	1
I don t have to come up	That s OK	ba	1
Can somebody tell me what the disagreement is	The	sd	1
Can someone summarize what the disagreement is	The he s saying that you have one on one die and two on the other but you can also have two on one die and one on the other	sd	2
The he s saying that you have one on one die and two on the other but you can also have two on one die and one on the other	But it s the same thing	sd	2
But it s the same thing	We re working with what it equals up to not the numbers that are on the die	sd	2
We re working with what it equals up to not the numbers that are on the die	We re we re working with what it equals not what	sd	2
We re we re working with what it equals not what	Unfortunately he makes somewhat sense because actually you do have two chances of hittin  it	sd	5
Unfortunately he makes somewhat sense because actually you do have two chances of hittin  it	What	ba	1
What	See look because if you roll if this die might show a one and this die might show a two but next time you roll it might be the other way around	sd	5
See look because if you roll if this die might show a one and this die might show a two but next time you roll it might be the other way around	What Jeff	sd	1
What Jeff	And that makes it two chances to hit that	sd	2
And that makes it two chances to hit that	Even though it s the same number it s two separate things on two different die	sd	2
Even though it s the same number it s two separate things on two different die	There s more there s more of a chance	sd	2
There s more there s more of a chance	Therefore there s two different ways	sd	2
Therefore there s two different ways	Therefore there are two ways to get three	sd	2
Therefore there are two ways to get three	And that like throws a monkey wrench	sd	1
And that like throws a monkey wrench	And that just screws up everything we just sorta like worked on for about the last hour	sd	1
And that just screws up everything we just sorta like worked on for about the last hour	Alright	b	1
Alright	OK what s it	sd	1
You sound like a mathematician	I m smart	sd	1
I m smart	OK	sd	1
OK	What this is is this is my chart	sd	1
What this is is this is my chart	Um our chart and that s Bill	sd	1
Um our chart and that s Bill	And what this is is um over here these numbers these don t have any times that these numbers these are numbers you can roll a lot	sd	4
And what this is is um over here these numbers these don t have any times that these numbers these are numbers you can roll a lot	Alright and two comes from one and I ll show you and it comes up one and I ll show you this part in a minute	sd	4
Alright and two comes from one and I ll show you and it comes up one and I ll show you this part in a minute	So what did we do to cut this stuff in half	sd	3
So what did we do to cut this stuff in half	But it makes sense unfortunately	sd	1
But it makes sense unfortunately	Well then if couldn t two come up twice then	sd	2
Well then if couldn t two come up twice then	No because Jeff one on one die and one on the other die is still the same thing	sd	5
No because Jeff one on one die and one on the other die is still the same thing	Even if you just OK	sd	1
Even if you just OK	Alright	b	1
Alright	If it comes up they re still one and one	sd	2
Jeff	Yeah because if it just seems like even even if you do switch you ll still be like the same thing	sd	5
Yeah because if it just seems like even even if you do switch you ll still be like the same thing	Alright	b	1
Alright	Yeah but that s the same thing as that	sd	2
Yeah but that s the same thing as that	No but this look on this one you have two and one	sd	5
No but this look on this one you have two and one	But you actually have to move the die to hit one and two	sd	5

Is It s hard to understand but it ll show you how you can get the number	Alright here	sd	1
Alright here	One and one is two and there s only one way to get two	sd	5
One and one is two and there s only one way to get two	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	So there s two ways to get three	sd	2
So there s two ways to get three	Didn t we have this stuff in like second grade	sd	1

Four and one um wait wait I mi messed up	OK four and one three and two two and three and one and four	sd	5
OK four and one three and two two and three and one and four	And so on	sd	5
And so on	And seven has the highest probability	sd	5
And seven has the highest probability	That doesn t mean seven  s gonna come up a lot because I know I rolled I kept getting eights and Brian kept getting four and Amy kept rolling what she said	sd	5
That doesn t mean seven  s gonna come up a lot because I know I rolled I kept getting eights and Brian kept getting four and Amy kept rolling what she said	You see what See you hand me the sheet uh this like the paper we worked on	sd	1
You see what See you hand me the sheet uh this like the paper we worked on	Hand me it	sd	1
Hand me it	So what happened is that this doesn t mean that your number  s gonna come up any time but seven does have the highest chance	sd	2
So what happened is that this doesn t mean that your number  s gonna come up any time but seven does have the highest chance	And unfair in Angela s paper	sd	2
And unfair in Angela s paper	Angela and Brian	sd	1
Just pull it down a little bit	OK	b	1
OK	For some reason	sd	1
More more	OK we ll just have to give player A oh this is Angela s idea on how to make it fair because player B has numbers that are m have more ways to come up so they re easier to get	sd	5
OK we ll just have to give player A oh this is Angela s idea on how to make it fair because player B has numbers that are m have more ways to come up so they re easier to get	Maybe because it s a game of luck and it doesn t matter	sd	5
Maybe because it s a game of luck and it doesn t matter	I it it helps but it really doesn t matter cause it s a game of luck	sd	5
I it it helps but it really doesn t matter cause it s a game of luck	Angela said give player A numbers two through six	sd	5
Angela said give player A numbers two through six	Give player B numbers eight through five	sd	5
Give player B numbers eight through five	Numbers eight through twelve have the same kind of chances as two through six	sd	5
Numbers eight through twelve have the same kind of chances as two through six	If you roll seven then you lose a turn	sd	5
If you roll seven then you lose a turn	Because seven has the most chances	sd	5
Because seven has the most chances	It wouldn t be fair to give player A sev two to seven or player B seven to twelve because the player with seven would have the most chance of winning	sd	5
It wouldn t be fair to give player A sev two to seven or player B seven to twelve because the player with seven would have the most chance of winning	This is a game of luck but I think it would be more fair	sd	5
This is a game of luck but I think it would be more fair	And then she drew a little picture	sd	5

And that s um that those are our charts and well like does anyone disagree with me	Well I m not disagreeing it s just when she was talking about the sevens we we marked down we played five games and we marked down out of four of those games like sevens the first time we didn t realize it but cause we had when we when you hit the seven we figured we d just be like roll again	sd	5
Well I m not disagreeing it s just when she was talking about the sevens we we marked down we played five games and we marked down out of four of those games like sevens the first time we didn t realize it but cause we had when we when you hit the seven we figured we d just be like roll again	So the first time the first game when we we had no sevens in our first game second game we had six the third game we had four and the fourth game we had one	sd	5
So the first time the first game when we we had no sevens in our first game second game we had six the third game we had four and the fourth game we had one	So we really like it doesn t mean j it just has a higher chance hitting it it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	sd	5
So we really like it doesn t mean j it just has a higher chance hitting it it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	Mhmm	sd	2
Mhmm	It s a game of luck	sd	2
It s a game of luck	I know I played five games with my dad and the first game player B won ten nothing	sd	2

Something still confuses Matt	Not something confused about	sd	1
Not something confused about	He just doesn t want anybody to know what we re talking about	sd	1
That the question I I I raised um I guess um I asked you to think about is if you rolled if you took the two dice and you shook them well an you rolled them both and I asked you that question before	Yeah	b	1
Or if you rolled one and then another does it matter	No	b	1
No	No it s just you see but say it was tied up and you needed a like an eleven to win if you rolled your first die and it came out one there s no way you re getting a ten on this one	sd	5
No it s just you see but say it was tied up and you needed a like an eleven to win if you rolled your first die and it came out one there s no way you re getting a ten on this one	So you could you j know you re gonna lose if you go like the you have you have like if you roll a five then you know you have a chance	sv	5
So you could you j know you re gonna lose if you go like the you have you have like if you roll a five then you know you have a chance	It all depends how you want to roll it	sd	5
It all depends how you want to roll it	If you want to roll  em tw if you want to roll  em one at a time or if you want to roll  em separate	sd	1
Stephanie	Um I was gonna say that it doesn t like matter in the least bit because like I could roll with I could roll my die together like this and I could say OK I m gonna get a ten on this one	sd	5
Um I was gonna say that it doesn t like matter in the least bit because like I could roll with I could roll my die together like this and I could say OK I m gonna get a ten on this one	I didn t get a ten	sd	5
I didn t get a ten	And I can roll it like this and I didn t get a ten either	sd	5
And I can roll it like this and I didn t get a ten either	It doesn t matter	sd	5
It doesn t matter	You re gonna get what you re gonna get one way or another	sd	5
You re gonna get what you re gonna get one way or another	Sure it might make sure I could roll like this and get a ten and I and I could roll like this and not get a ten but that doesn t	sd	5
Sure it might make sure I could roll like this and get a ten and I and I could roll like this and not get a ten but that doesn t	That s the second time	sd	2
That s the second time	Oops but it doesn t matter	sd	4
OK something to say about that Brian	Well see if you re rolling with two this could happen sometimes	sd	5
Well see if you re rolling with two this could happen sometimes	But it doesn t happen like most of the time	sd	5
But it doesn t happen like most of the time	Like you could be rolling with two and when they hit the ground they could like hit each other and they could just go flying off it and then but if you roll it with one and you ll roll it with the other it s not going to hit each other	sd	5
Like you could be rolling with two and when they hit the ground they could like hit each other and they could just go flying off it and then but if you roll it with one and you ll roll it with the other it s not going to hit each other	Unless you aim it	sd	2
Unless you aim it	But there s a possibility that they could that it s like that and it could hit it	sd	2
But there s a possibility that they could that it s like that and it could hit it	It could hit it like	sd	2
It could hit it like	But there s still a possibility it could hit each other	sd	2
But there s still a possibility it could hit each other	Like that	sd	2
Like that	Jeff if you go like this if you go like this and it hits each other if	sd	2
Jeff if you go like this if you go like this and it hits each other if	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	If you drop it like this	sd	2
If you drop it like this	Like that but no if you that could change the two	sd	2
I have another problem I d like you to think about really quickly	Uh oh	aa	1
Uh oh	Oh	b	1
I gonna change it now	Oh don t change it	sd	1
Oh don t change it	We were just getting used to this problem	sd	1
We were just getting used to this problem	Wait a second wait	sd	1
Wait a second wait	No	b	1
No	Wait a sec	sd	1
Suppose you have a choice to be player A or player B which would you choose and why	Player A	sd	4
Player A	Cause seven has more possibilities	sd	5
Cause seven has more possibilities	But it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	sd	2
But it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	I know	aa	1
I know	But it does have like it	sd	1
But it does have like it	Doesn t eight and seven have the same amount of chances	sd	2
Doesn t eight and seven have the same amount of chances	Sarah	b	1

No it doesn t	In this chart pl seven has six six different ways	sd	2
In this chart pl seven has six six different ways	With eight only has five	sd	2
With eight only has five	Even though there s really no difference and it s again a game of luck it doesn t matter because it doesn t matter because wait OK it do i i  it m I d rather be player A because player A had maybe one more chance than player B	sd	5
Even though there s really no difference and it s again a game of luck it doesn t matter because it doesn t matter because wait OK it do i i  it m I d rather be player A because player A had maybe one more chance than player B	And that	sd	1
Stephanie thinks player A has one more chance than	Yes	b	1
One more chance	Well it has one more possibility	sd	4
Matt	I could I could chance impossible	sd	1
I could I could chance impossible	The chance of four and the same two numbers	sd	4
The chance of four and the same two numbers	No matter which way you put it	sd	4
No matter which way you put it	It s not like it s a four and a five	sd	4
It s not like it s a four and a five	That s why she said there s only five ways	sd	5
That s why she said there s only five ways	I know	aa	1
So you re agreeing with that	Yeah	b	2
Let s see if we agree on them	What d you do	aa	3
What d you do	Look at them	sd	1
Look at them	Yo guys have a little respect	sd	1

How	You re good	sd	1
You re good	We re so mean	sd	1
We re so mean	Now there s six and this one right	sd	2
Now there s six and this one right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So that would be six and the other six and then	sd	2
So that would be six and the other six and then	Six and the other six	sd	2

Is there another way you can show that same idea	We got the same answer except we re we re	sd	2
We got the same answer except we re we re	I have	sd	1
I have	This weekend	sd	1
Thank you Matt	I do	sd	1
I do	Did you do this	qy	1
Is there any there any other way you can show that	I do	sd	1
I do	I go to write in order but	sd	1
Let s hear from Ankur then we ll have Milin and um Michelle s yeah	We put one and then put it a dash and then plus put one two three	sd	4
That might help Jeff and do you mind Matt	See that marker that Jeff	sd	1
See that marker that Jeff	Note that Matt hasn t said anything	sd	1
Note that Matt hasn t said anything	Turn it	sd	1
That s not a good one	Jeff	aa	1

Gotta put my	Bill has no pupils	sd	1
You want to keep on going and show us the general pattern Ankur	No no make lots of	sd	1
I I m interested Stephanie in your other chart where you did them this way in this way	Oh this	aa	1
No the other one	The other one	sd	1
The other one	This	sd	1
This	This one that we re gonna to explain	sd	1
You still had another one I m interested	I had another one oh	sd	1
I had another one oh	The the dot one	sd	1
No the the one with the numbers	This one	sd	1
in rows and columns	This one	sd	1
This one	It s the same one as this only this one s neater	sd	1
I d still like you to show that that s a little different way of looking at it	Oh sure	aa	1
Can you put show from well	If you want	b	1
OK what do you think about that Jeff	Well it makes sense	sd	2
Well it makes sense	It s just like plain English	sd	1
Want to say a little more	Well it s just like the way it should be	sd	1
Well it s just like the way it should be	I did ah Mad it was just that either me thehe put the one and he just put like one through six and it didn t look right and then he started circling stuff and then scared me	sd	2
I did ah Mad it was just that either me thehe put the one and he just put like one through six and it didn t look right and then he started circling stuff and then scared me	But that s basically almost	sd	1
But that s basically almost	That s just it s just	sd	1
That s just it s just	Isn t it basically kinda what Matt did	sd	2
Isn t it basically kinda what Matt did	It s just basically what Matt did but this looks like an answer and his looked like	sd	2
It s just basically what Matt did but this looks like an answer and his looked like	It s the same thing	sd	2
It s the same thing	Put like the number in front of it	sd	2
Put like the number in front of it	Yeah	b	2
What else were you going to say Romina	They re the same thing	sd	4
How about you Michelle	Let s go come on	sd	1
Let s go come on	Am I coming	sd	1
Am I coming	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	You have to come	sd	1
You have to come	I ll come	sd	1
I ll come	What did I do though	sd	1
What did I do though	I made dots on the paper	sd	1
Go ahead um Jeff	But all I did was write those little blue dots you see	sd	1
But all I did was write those little blue dots you see	OK	b	1
OK	And aren t they beautiful	sd	1
And aren t they beautiful	It s like Stephanie s chart and then see you made the we just counted all the little box thingies	sd	1
It s like Stephanie s chart and then see you made the we just counted all the little box thingies	OK but there s a really good the simplest way to do it is this	sd	1
OK but there s a really good the simplest way to do it is this	You coulda made that a little neater	sd	1
You coulda made that a little neater	Six numbers on one	sd	1
I want to make sure everyone understands that chart	Shut up	aa	1
Shut up	They counted up boxes everyone they counted up the little tiny boxes	sd	1
They counted up boxes everyone they counted up the little tiny boxes	Does everyone understand that	sd	1
Does everyone understand that	All the little tiny boxes	sd	1
All the little tiny boxes	So basically	sd	1
So basically	Cause	b	1
Cause	what it shows is that there s like six numbers on the die and like twelve numbers between both	sd	4
what it shows is that there s like six numbers on the die and like twelve numbers between both	Yeah so it s like just like	sd	2
Yeah so it s like just like	Alright the really really really really simple way to do it this	sd	1
Alright the really really really really simple way to do it this	Six numbers on one die six numbers on the other die	sd	2
Bring it down some	They can t see that	sd	1
They can t see that	There s six numbers on one die and there s six numbers on the other die and you multiply them together and get thirty six	sd	5
There s six numbers on one die and there s six numbers on the other die and you multiply them together and get thirty six	Six times six is six	sd	5
Six times six is six	We re advanced	sd	1
What do the numbers on the sides represent	Uh on these sides	sd	1
Let s take in the first column what do those numbers represent	Right here right here right here	aa	1
Yeah	They re numbers on	sd	1
They re numbers on	These are numbers one of the dice and these are the numbers on the other die	sd	4
What do the numbers in in the body of the table mean	Uh what the what like the one and one	sd	1
Uh what the what like the one and one	Equal	b	4
Equal	OK so equals two	sd	2
Yeah	Is you can get two one way	sd	5
Is you can get two one way	One and one	sd	5
One and one	and one	sd	2
and one	Now you can get three two ways	sd	2
Now you can get three two ways	You can get three two ways	sd	2
You can get three two ways	Which is like two and	sd	2
Which is like two and	Two and one	sd	2
Two and one	That equals three	sd	2
That equals three	and	sd	1
and	one and two that	sd	2
How do you know but	Shows how many times you can get each number	sd	4
I don t understand what the	The number in the chart shows you the number that you get	sd	4
How do you get it	Alright	b	1
Alright	See the number that s placed under one of the numbers and next to the other number	sd	4
See the number that s placed under one of the numbers and next to the other number	So it like two and one is three	sd	4
So what are you doing to get the three	Adding	sd	4
You re adding the two and the one	Yeah	b	1
The numbers inside are the sums	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	2
The numbers on the outsides are what you roll on each of the die	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	See	aa	1
So one would be go ahead Jeff	Well like like how it says that there s one two three four five six sevens that means there s six different possible ways to get it	sd	4
You mean the sum of seven	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	This is this is really sloppy	sd	1
This is this is really sloppy	The other one I made was neat and you	sd	1
The other one I made was neat and you	Does everybody remember those like little charts we used to get in second grade	sd	1
Does everybody remember those like little charts we used to get in second grade	Yeah ye and you	sd	1
Yeah ye and you	One times one is one	sd	1
One times one is one	Except this is like adding one and one is two	sd	1
Except this is like adding one and one is two	That taught us how to add just kind of you know	sd	1
That taught us how to add just kind of you know	inside the trapper keepers they have it	sd	1
inside the trapper keepers they have it	The ones you used to cheat off of and	sd	1
The ones that you cheat off of	Yeah	b	1
So how many outcomes are there if you re rolling two die	Thirty six	sd	4
Thirty six	Thirty six	sd	2
And you can count them	And you can prove it by counting these	sd	4
And you can prove it by counting these	One two three four five six	sd	1
One two three four five six	One two three four five six	sd	1
Would it matter	No	b	1
No	As long as it has the same number of	sd	4
The same numbers	If one dies has one through six on it and the red die should have one through six on it	sd	5
OK	If it has	sd	1
If it has	And then the combinations are the same	sd	4
Thank you very much that s	You re welcome	sd	1
I know you re getting tired let s just listen to Milin	You can keep us  til two twenty two	sd	1
You can keep us  til two twenty two	Oh my god Stephanie Bill has pupils	sd	1
Oh my god Stephanie Bill has pupils	Oh no	ba	1
And then we have one final question Jeff	I got this from both of Stephanie s charts	sd	2
I got this from both of Stephanie s charts	Cause it s like one of the was like the triangle thing and the other one was the other way	sd	1
Cause it s like one of the was like the triangle thing and the other one was the other way	This shows kind of you could get and I did this basically show both	sd	1
Tell us what they each represent	OK	b	1
OK	Like for the for the to get two there s there s only one way and that s one and one	sd	5
Like for the for the to get two there s there s only one way and that s one and one	To get three there s one and two and two and one	sd	5
To get three there s one and two and two and one	To get four there s two and two one and three and three and one	sd	5
To get four there s two and two one and three and three and one	To get five there s one and four four and one three and two and two and three	sd	5
To get five there s one and four four and one three and two and two and three	For six there s three and three two and four four and two one and five and five and one	sd	5
Remember Stephanie s chart up here	Is it	sd	1
How is Milin s chart different than	Well he did it off of this chart	sd	2
Well he did it off of this chart	Yeah he sorta did he used those numbers on his chart	sd	2
Yeah he sorta did he used those numbers on his chart	He just like turned turned and then	sd	2
He just like turned turned and then	Wrote the numbers into the square	sd	2
Wrote the numbers into the square	Yeah he like mixed them	sd	2
Yeah he like mixed them	He wrote the numbers in the blank in the squares	sd	2
He wrote the numbers in the blank in the squares	He put them in a blank	sd	2
Oh in the squares the numbers went in Stephanie s squares	Instead of like the shaded where the shaded he wrote the numbers in	sd	2
So so	Basically the same	sd	2
Did you have a	That one	sd	2
That one	I think his i I think Milin s is is	sd	2
I think his i I think Milin s is is	Shows all the numbers	sd	2
Shows all the numbers	Because you see	sd	1
You like to see all the numbers	Matt I was sort of confused but Stephanie you needed two charts to it  understand what she was saying and Mil Milin	sd	2
Matt I was sort of confused but Stephanie you needed two charts to it  understand what she was saying and Mil Milin	One chart does it all	sd	2
One chart does it all	Milin	sd	1
Milin	Milin sort of took both and put it in with a little bit of  and mixed it up and took it out and he got that	sd	2
Milin sort of took both and put it in with a little bit of  and mixed it up and took it out and he got that	He summed it up	sd	2
I have one final question are you ready	What is mathematics	sd	1
One final question	What is mathematics	sd	1
Jeff	Can we  we never had play like  carry on please	sd	1
Can we  we never had play like  carry on please	We don t have to go until two twenty two	sd	1
We d love to take you with us	Oh	b	1
We have three dice here	What do you teach	aa	1
What do you teach	Like what class do you teach	sd	1
OK	Math	sd	1
Math	They teach science	sd	1
They teach science	Maybe my brother has them	sd	1
I have three dice	Mhmm	aa	1
Mhmm	OK	sd	1
OK	Can you tell me can you tell me	qy	1
Can you tell me can you tell me	how it goes	sd	1
and again I m interested in ah I m rolling three	Yeah	b	1
Can you get in  imagine in your head the possible How many possible outcomes are there if you re rolling three	Six times six times six	sd	4
Six times six times six	Well the obvious thing is b how we usually do it	sd	1
Well the obvious thing is b how we usually do it	Six times six	sd	4
Six times six	That would be six times six times six	sd	2
That would be six times six times six	Times six	sd	2
Times six	But actually it would turn out to be something different cause we re just jumping to a conclusion	sd	2
But actually it would turn out to be something different cause we re just jumping to a conclusion	No	b	2
No	And you re	sd	1
We want to hear that	How can you be positive	sd	3
Yeah	Twenty one	sd	4
If you had one chance to roll the dice and everything was on it what number would you choose	Seven	sd	4
What	Seven	sd	4
Suppose you re rolling three what is the one number	Nothing	sd	1
Do you want us to come back	Yeah come back	sd	1
Yeah come back	How about tomorrow	sd	1
How about tomorrow	OK look	sd	1
Is this a good thing to do	Yeah	b	1
And you want to come to Rutgers some time	Yeah	b	1
This has been great fun	Brian	sd	1
Brian	Million dollar roll	sd	1
You were just great	Seven	sd	1
Seven	He said you lost number seven	sd	1
Talk about the next one and write up why you it	OK	b	1
OK	I could stay there the whole time	sd	1
Good afternoon class	Good afternoon Mr Ho	sd	1
Yeung Wan Chi	Is absent	sd	1
Anyone	Yes you hear	sd	1
If yes you can how many are there	Next time Ill tell oh	sd	1
How can it be number 24	Twentytwo	sd	4
Twentytwo	Twentythree	sd	2
First of all are there any special questions	No	b	1
Are there	No	b	1
Are there any questions on question number 20 with the star	No	b	1
Twentyone and 22 are both very easy right	Yes	b	1
Uh	Twentythree	sd	4
Which is the last question you have finished	This one	sd	1
Which question did I tell you to do	I am thinking	sd	1
Dont dont tell me that you dont know how to do them	Okay I am thinking	sd	1
Dont do them when I am teaching later okay	Okay	b	1
Finish them for me when you stay after class	I dont know how to do number 20	sd	3
I dont know how to do number 20	Can you teach me	sd	3
Which one is bigger and which one is smaller	A	b	4
Uh Ho Wai Kwan	A	b	4
What is the sum of three plus negative three	Zero	sd	4
Louder	Zero	sd	4
Louder	Zero	sd	4
So now positive B plus negative B is equal to what	Zero	sd	4
So 20 plus what	Eight	sd	4
Well but I said earlier that positive B plus negative B is how many	Zero	sd	4
You should be accustomed to it	Zero	sd	4
Well you can see in this situation that what is left after the summation is	Two A equals to 28	sd	4
What is the remaining unknown	A	b	4
A is	Fourteen	sd	4
We have already found one of the unknowns	Substitute it back into the equation	sd	4
Example number four in the textbook	Can I go wash my hands	sd	1
I have taken role already	Thanks	b	1
Okay what do you do when you cancel the X	Subtract	sd	4
How do we do it	Move three X	sd	4
Move three X	Move three X to the other side	sd	2
Do you do you have any ideas	Three X minus three X	sd	4
Did you hear	Number two	sd	1
After you have finished	Yes	b	1
Chan Lap Man hurry up	Question number three	sd	1
Yes	X is	sd	1
Substitute X is equal to six back into the equation	This X is equal to six so it becomes six minus Y is 10	sd	5
Can Y be negative four	Um that is right	aa	1
Um that is right	Can I erase this	sd	1
Is that a one one under the	X equals to one	sd	4
Why is it here here what is this	Nothing	sd	1
Student on duty clean up the blackboard	No the upper one times the lower one	sd	4
Are there any questions	The one on the bottom	sd	1
Calculating number four for those of you who have not finished are you doing number four	I am doing number five	sd	1
Is there any way to make them the same	Multiplication	aa	4
Therefore the rest of the equation will be	Multiplied by two	sd	4
Chan Kwan Wu after multiplied by two after multiplied by two	The second part uh positive four Y	sd	4
Four Y and then	Twentyfour	sd	4
Addition or subtraction	Subtraction	aa	4
Two X minus two X is	Zero	sd	4
How many	Negative 21	sd	4
Negative 21	Negative 21	sd	2
So Y is equal to	Negative three	sd	4
So how do we make three and two the same	Find out their LCM	sd	4
Two times what	Three	sd	4
Do you remember	What	ba	1
Any impressions	Slope	sd	4
Slope	No	b	2
Long paper	Is the test going to be difficult	sd	1
Stand up	Do we need to bring our books	sd	1
However do you remember you have to bring two new books tomorrow	I remember	sd	1

Just put it right on the table back there	Thank you	aa	1
Dont leave without it all right	Oh	sd	1
Everybody ready	Yep	b	1
Nick	The slope	sd	4
Use the slope with the	Y intercept and X intercept	sd	4
Thats probably the way youll probably want to do it right Nick	Yeah	b	1
Robert	Use the um tables	sd	1
Nick question	Wheres the oh right here	sd	1
That is your result for your group	So everybody has to do one graph right	sd	1
What are we going to do	Do we write this on our piece of paper	sd	1
Yeah	Oh okay	b	1
All right	Mr Ormsby you know when you put like a one in here would you go like times	sd	1
First of all zeros are our favorite number right	Yeah	b	1
Twothirds times zero is what	Zero	sd	4
Plus eight is	Eight	sd	4
Now because this fraction is a twothirds do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now	Um threes	sd	4
That way you dont have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers	Okay	b	1
All right	Mr Ormsby whoohoo	sd	1
Mr Ormsby whoohoo	Okay	b	1
Okay	Mister I forgot how to do these again	sd	1
Mister I forgot how to do these again	Like how do you do X and Y	sd	3
Jenna	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So it was zero one two and	sd	4
Ah thats true except because this is a twothirds fraction	You want to pick three as like	sd	4
Exactly	Negative three zero and three	sd	4
All right	I got six  in the middle	sd	4
I got six  in the middle	So zero three six	sd	4
So zero three six	I get six	sd	4
Right	Okay	b	1
Okay	No thats not true	sv	1
Okay were going to put in zero here right	Okay	b	1
Whats twothirds times zero	Zero	sd	4
Plus eight is	Eight	sd	4
Eight	So three times two is six	sd	5
So three times two is six	Divided by three is two	sd	5
Three is two	Plus eight is	sd	4
Eight is	Ten	sd	4
Ten	Okay I get it	sd	1
Okay I get it	Thank you Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Good job	So six times	sd	4
So six times	All right so okay this is what I did	sd	1
All right so okay this is what I did	I put three negative three zero three and six all right	sd	4
Ive never done that before	Well I did that	sd	1
Okay	Its easier this way	sd	1
Its easier this way	Its easier	sd	1
All right if you say so	Anyways I put negative three so I put twothirds and then	sd	4
Times negative three	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Negative three goes in the top right	sd	4
There you go	So so its a one and a one	sd	4
So so its a one and a one	But thats a negative still right	sd	4
Thats still a negative there	So its negative two	sd	4
So its negative two	So its negative two	sd	2
Yeah	See I knew that	sd	1
Now three I question though	Try a positive three	sd	5
Try a positive three	Twothird so three one	sd	4
Twothird so three one	Oh	b	1
Okay	One one and then three eight 11	sd	4
Wait a minute	One is	sd	4
One is	And five	sd	2
Two plus wait a minute no you were timesing it	Oh	b	1
Oh	Its two so	sd	1
Its two so	Its 10	sd	4
Its 10	Yeah	b	2
And then six is 12	Its six then 10 and 12	sd	4
Its six then 10 and 12	Okay	b	1
Yes	All right I just totally forgot um you know how to do the graph	sd	3
All right	Okay	b	1
If I put in zero there whats threefifths times zero	Um zero	sd	4
Minus 10	Is negative 10	sd	4
So now youre going to now try five in there right	Okay	b	1
So if I do three times five thats	Fifteen	sd	4
Now remember Im going to divide by the five which gives me	Three	sd	4
Minus 10	Negative seven	sd	4
I think you got it now	Oh okay	b	1
Finish it up	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
All right	Uh how many points do you want us to plot	sd	1
Uh how many points do you want us to plot	Three or four	sd	1
But just to make sure	Three	sd	4
Plot at least three points	Okay	b	1
Okay	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Yeah	I made the graph	sd	1
Okay	Dont we have to use use graph graph every single one of those	sd	1
Make a big coordinate system	Oh	b	1
As a matter of fact Let me give you a fresh one to save you some time	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	All right now I get it	sd	1
All right now I get it	All right	aa	1
All right	So we have to make one big um	sd	1
Use the whole coordinate system that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything	All right	aa	1
Okay	Were out of	sd	1
Using an X Y table	Yeah	b	1
Or do you want to learn how to use slope and Y intercept	X Y table	sd	1
Right	Mm hm	sd	1
But because this fraction is a twothirds what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me	Three	sd	4
Or zero three six would be good enough right	Yeah	b	1
So you need my help or do you want to try it on your own first	So to input this X do I have to put this number	sd	1
You want to do the negative	Yeah	b	1
Now you know Im going to do two times negative three is	Negative six	sd	4
Divide by three is	Neg negative two	sd	4
Positive six	Oh	b	1
Ben see what Chris did there	All right	aa	1
All right sir it looks like youre being left out here arent you	No	b	1
Okay you understand what theyre doing	Were using slope	sd	4
All right	Okay number four	sd	1
Oh by the way guys I like how you labeled them like that	Thanks	b	1
So tell me how you would graph that	I would	sd	1
Here we go	I would go negative nine	sd	4
I would go negative nine	So one two three four five	sd	4
Now thats negative nine for X	Uh huh	b	1
Right	Mm hm	sd	1
That negative nine really is my Y intercept	So then	sd	1
So then	I go down	sd	4
Ah ha	One two three four five six seven eight nine 10	sd	1
And now my slope is onefourth	Uh huh	b	1
So that means	One one two three four	sd	1
Excellent job	Oh	b	1
All right	times two is six	sd	4
times two is six	Negative six	sd	4
Negative six	All right this is seven 10 13 and 16 this time	sd	4
Okay	Is this right	aa	1
Whats your question Brandon	I dont even know how to do this	sd	1
I dont even know how to do this	I dont get it	sd	3
Shes doing an excellent job here	Oh	b	1
What are you shy or something	No I just asked this guy and he said	sd	1
No I just asked this guy and he said	Im trying to do it too	sd	1
Im trying to do it too	Im trying to figure this one out	sd	1
Im trying to figure this one out	Yeah how do you do this	aa	3
All right	Mr Ormsby this is like the same thing as I did that one right	sd	1
Mr Ormsby this is like the same thing as I did that one right	That	aa	1
Lets take a look here	I mean I know how to do this but I dont know how to do the fractions	sd	3
I mean a lot of these tables look great now lets get them plotted here	Okay	b	1
And we can see what it comes out to be	So after we write them all down we plot them on here	sd	4
Right	Every single one	sd	1
Okay	All right	aa	1
Question	I know how to do the regular ones	sd	1
I know how to do the regular ones	I dont know how to do the one with fractions	sd	3
I dont know how to do the one with fractions	Thats confusing	sd	1
Thats confusing	Those are the ones that I have trouble with	sd	1
Those are the ones that I have trouble with	Was he Were you listening when Mr Ormsby was saying this	sd	1
Sounds like Nick knows what hes doing	No I said that I have trouble on it	sd	1
Okay then maybe we ought to go to Ashley	Nah I could	sd	1
Okay	So you want put	sd	1
What do we got going on here	Were done	sd	1
Sir	Well we got done with all the	sd	1
Well we got done with all the	We were going to call you but you were talking to them	sd	1
Trying to embarrass me here or something	Of course not	sd	1
Uh huh	Youre really slow	sd	1
Youre really slow	For these ones here	sd	1
Youre such a character Nick	For these for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table and were done	sd	4
And everybody agr here agrees right	Uh huh	b	1
What number is that one	Uh I think that was five	sv	4
Okay I can safely assume that this one must be the four right	That was five	sd	4
Which ones the four	This ones two	sd	4
Which ones two	Four is this	sd	5
Four is this	Four four is negative nine and up one is four	sd	5
Four four is negative nine and up one is four	This one	sd	1
This one	So that yeah this is four	aa	4
Are you sure about that	Yeah	b	1
Because this one	One two three four five six seven eight and nine	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight and nine	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	This is four	sd	4
Ah	Right	b	4
Cause right there I cant tell which line youre talking about right	Right	b	1
So both of those look excellent	Six minus	sd	4
Number one slope with twothirds starting at eight and this one is seven right	Mm hm	sd	1
Thats a positive three X	Oh	b	1
It should be going	Up	b	4
Okay	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Yeah	We dont get number five	sd	3
All right first of all you know the Y intercept is what	Negative five	sd	4
So put a dot on negative five	One two three four five	sd	1
We all agree on that	Yes	b	2
Guess what number is in front of that X	A one	sd	2
How do I make one a fraction	One over one	sd	4
Now remember slope is rise over run right	Mm hm	sd	1
So put a three next to that	Okay	b	1
So number them in other words okay	Okay	b	1
So as soon as you get that done which youre almost done you get them numbered just move on to the next set of five	Okay	b	1
All right	Yeah	b	1
All right	So Y is threefifths X negative 10	sd	4
You try youre doing negative five right	Yeah	b	1
Three times negative five is negative 15	Negative 15	sd	1
Minus 10	Is um negative um seven Oh minus 10	sd	4
So lets change that	Mm hm	sd	1
Well negative five is going to be not five but negative	Thirteen	sd	4
Get some help from them	Okay	b	1
Wait a minute whats threefifths times zero	Threefifths times zero	sd	1
Minus 10 would be	Ten	sd	4
Ten	No	b	4
Zero minus 10 would be	Ten	sd	4
Not positive 10	Negative 10	sd	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	So oh	sd	1
Now its a positive five right	Yeah	b	1
Divided by five is	Three	sd	4
Three minus 10	Seven	sd	4
Dont forget the negative	Negative seven	sd	4
Negative seven	Oh all right	aa	1
Thanks for waiting so long	Okay	b	1
All right you want me to just check the answers	Yeah	b	1
For example this is one correct	Yeah	b	1
This one was equation three	Yeah	b	1
Just number them and move on to the next five	Okay	b	1
Okay	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Mr Ormsby	Were on number six	sd	1
Were on number six	I got it guys	sd	1
I got it guys	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Check our answers	sd	1
Check our answers	So heres all of number five	sd	1
Excellent work	I crossed it out	sd	1
I crossed it out	Theres one theres two theres three and theres four and theres five	sd	1
Theres one theres two theres three and theres four and theres five	I figured it out	sd	1
I figured it out	But it theyre having problems on number	sd	1
But it theyre having problems on number	Oh there it is	sd	1
Oh there it is	I found it	sd	1
I found it	I found it	sd	1
I found it	I I now I  do	sd	1
As a matter of fact I think its time for me to address the whole class	Okay	b	1
Starting on number six	Yep thats what were doing	sd	1
Yep thats what were doing	Were starting	sd	1
All right	Yep all	sd	1
Does that make sense to everybody	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Could you check ours	sd	1
Could you check ours	All right	aa	1
Yeah	Actually Im on four	sd	1
You guys numbered them	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Equation five looks good	I havent even gotten to five	sd	1
I havent even gotten to five	Im already	sd	1
It looks perfect so far	Okay	b	1
Move on to equation six then	Okay	b	1
On which one	Well theyre obviously on five and	sd	1
Okay	Were on	sd	1
Youve got the one of the smartest kids in class right here	Hes tried to explain it once but Im not so sure	sd	1
You understand what you did there	Yeah	b	1
So you when you put in zero onefourth times zero is what	Zero	sd	4
Minus nine is	Negative nine	sd	4
Then you tried four right	Yeah	b	1
Numbers like that	Because theyre divisible by four	sd	5
Just one	Yeah	b	1
Minus nine is a negative eight	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Can I see this really quick	sd	1
Can I see this really quick	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Guys	Are you sure this is right	aa	1
Are you sure this is right	Because youre all	sd	1
Oh so you want me to just check six real quick right	And five	sd	1
And five	And five	sd	1
And five	Five because thats the one we messed up on	sd	1
Five now looks perfect	No three	sd	1
No three	Three was	sd	1
So three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope which you did perfectly	All right	aa	1
Heres six so you started at positive eight	Yeah	b	1
The slope is negative fivethirds so you went down five and over three didnt you	Yeah	b	1
Perfect	All right	aa	1
Ashley how is Brandon doing here	Im helping him	sd	1
Thats what I want to see	The rest were done	sd	1
The rest were done	We just want you to check	sd	1
Let me meet with Ashley over here	Okeydokey	aa	1
But I can tell you right now five is good	Okay	b	1
Okay	And you see the pattern in eight and 10	sd	3
And you see the pattern in eight and 10	If I put how many do you add for 10	sd	3
Let me check one again	Yeah youve got to do 12	aa	1
So first of all our Y intercept is eight	Wait wait	sd	1
Ashley lets look at yours since youre more comfortable with yours	Yeah	b	1
You agree that zero eight should be my first point right	Mm hm	sd	1
Thats good	Hold on Brandon	sd	1
Hold on Brandon	I made one over three	sd	4
I made one over three	One two three	sd	1
Oh heres your mistake	Yep Jessie	b	1
When I put in three two times the three would be six	Oh yeah	b	1
Six divided by three is two right	I know its two	sd	1
Okay	Eleven	sd	4
Eleven	Twelve	sd	2
Twelve	This may be 12	sd	2
I believe its 12	Yeah see I did it on here but I did it wrong on my paper	sd	4
Okay	Its weird	sd	1
Two says were starting at what number	Negative 10	sd	4
Hey how come we didnt use your table	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	We were looking at his	sd	1
We were looking at his	Okay	b	1
Okay	So if we start at 10 then	sd	1
You copied the equation down wrong	Thats number four	sd	1
My mistake	Oh yeah it does start at six	sd	4
That should be a negative 10 right	It looks like a six but its 10	sd	1
And five you got negative seven	Yeah	b	1
I agree with that	Yeah	b	1
All right	All right	aa	1
All right	Mr Ormsby whoohoo	sd	1
Hey how come none of these lines are labeled	Whoops	sd	1
Now what I suggest you do	two lines	sd	1
Put a number at the end of each of these lines	Oh like number one two three	sd	1
I dont like what I see here	Look what you made me do	sd	1
Look what you made me do	You probably thought of it wrong	sd	1
Number one I believe this is supposed to be your number one here right	I think so	sv	1
I think so	I dont know	sd	1
How come its going down guys	I dont know it does it	sd	1
So all of these should be going up	Hows it going down	sd	3
Its going down	Its going up	sd	4
How do you read a book sir	Left to right	sd	1
So lets start on the left side of the line	Yeah	b	1
And as I move to the right Im going in which direction	Down	aa	4
Now if you look at all the other lines see theyre all positive	But its going up	sd	4
All right	Its going down like that	sd	4
Correct this one at least	How come weve never done this before	sd	1
Okay	You made me do it	sd	1
You made me do it	Could you check our answers for	sd	1
So heres your number six right	Uh huh	b	1
And you started at eight and the slope was negative fivethirds so you went down five and over three	Uh huh	b	1
Lets check number eight real quick	All right I think I did it kinda	sd	1
Number nine is 14 which is where	Its all the way up here	sd	4
So now all you guys have to do	Answer the questions	sd	1
The best you can	On this piece of paper	sd	1
On your piece of paper okay	Okay	b	1
On your own piece of paper	Okay	b	1
All right how we doing here guys	I dont know	sd	1
Whats the ruler for	Oh	b	1
Just from now on make sure straighten out these lines and keep going	All right	aa	1
Thats number one	Yeah	b	1
Number two	No thats number three	sd	1
No thats number three	I forgot to do number two	sd	1
Number three is concerning me	Yeah	b	1
Its three X plus seven right	Yeah	b	1
When I put in zero whats three times zero	Zero	sd	4
Plus seven is	Seven	sd	4
Whats zero plus seven	Well I started Oh	sd	1
All right	I didnt know it was right	sd	1
Put away the book	Okay	b	1
Someone must be making a mistake because were getting different answers here right	Mm hm	sd	1
I would trust Chris Chris to be honest	All right	aa	1
Okay	I used twos  threes	sd	4
Now did you have to go by twos	I I dont did I	sd	1
Isnt this just a regular number three	Yeah	b	1
All right guys lets see what we can do here	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Mr Ormsby	All right never mind	sd	1
Okay	I guess	aa	1
Does everything I say make sense so far	Yes Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Twelve minutes left in class	Um	sd	1
If for whatever reason you actually get to the last page	Yeah we are at there	sd	1
Were going to pick up were going to pick this up again on Monday but if you happen to ask these questions	Monday	sd	1
Yeah were back on Monday right	Yeah	b	1
At about lets say four or five minutes Im going to make all of you do it anyways	Youre so generous Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Lets focus on this	We got done and we  like wheres the paper at	sd	1
We got done and we  like wheres the paper at	Right there	aa	1
All right Ashley	Yeah um Okay I dont get these two	sd	1
Does anyone in this group	No	b	1
Understand what to do here	No	b	1
No	Because like theres different numbers	sd	3
Because like theres different numbers	Which one would we use	sd	3
Now you want to use slope and Y intercept or do you want to make tables	Tables	sd	1
Seems like tables are the way to go here right	Yeah	b	1
First of all Ashley thats a negative fivethirds isnt it	Oh	b	1
Oh	Wait No the fastest	sd	1
If I plug in zero whats negative fivethirds times zero	Zero	sd	4
Plus eight is	Eight	sd	4
That was easy	But I dont know what to use	sd	3
But I dont know what to use	Like threes	sd	4
Okay	My stomachs hurting	sd	1
My stomachs hurting	Can I get a drink of water	sd	1
Nick Jessie you ready	Two 10	sd	4
If I put in a three there okay	Its going to be five right	sd	4
Whats negative five plus eight	Negative Oh yeah	b	1
Positive three	Wait  is negative two	sd	4
Wait  is negative two	Wait is that how you do three	sv	1
And then the next one is going to be what	Negative two	sd	4
You got it	Oh	b	1
two	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	I	sd	1
Okay you havent done You did that in your head huh	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I always do my work in my head	sd	1
Thats all	All right	aa	1
Why do you keep getting out of your seat Robert	Well I have to	sd	1
So whats going on here how we doing	Okay	b	1
Okay	Were doing fine	sd	1
So have I come by to check all 10 equations yet	No not yet were just Were on number 10	sd	1
No not yet were just Were on number 10	Not all 10	sd	1
Not all 10	Just the first five	sd	1
Just the first five	Were on number 10	sd	1
You want me to wait until you get number 10 done	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
All right	Why did I get it wrong oh I didnt write it	sd	1
Whats going on	Well because weve been waiting for you	sd	1
Okay all right	For like a century	sd	1
Or if youre not stuck what would like me Do you want me to just check your answers then	Yeah	b	1
Is that what youre saying	Yeah	b	1
Yes or no	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
Oh really	Well because youve been over there you know	sd	1
All right lets start with six through 10	Well were only on eight	sd	1
So Okay so Ill do Ill do the first eight hows that	First eight Okay	sd	1
You would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one	Number three	sd	1
So that one is perfect	And number three	sd	1
See eights a negative onethird	Yeah but thats a plus 12	sd	4
We can do this all right	Zero three and six is right though right	sd	4
So why did you plot down here when zero positive 12 is up there	Oh I made a mistake	sd	4
Okay lets look at the rest of your table	I put a negative	sd	4
All right if I put a three here DeCarlos whats onethird of three	Um one	sd	1
So that negative makes it a negative one plus 12 which was a positive So you had these points exactly right	I check I put them backwards	sd	4
So you put them down you plotted wrong basically right	Yeah	b	1
All right	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Youre finally done right	Yes	b	1
Spotcheck a few of them because Id like you to move on to the questions	Okay	b	1
Okay	All right	aa	1
You just finished 10 right	Mm hm	sd	1
All right	Thats a lot of questions	sd	1
Youre going to have more time on Monday anyway	All right	aa	1
When you graphed them what did you honestly notice about them all	They all had a slope	sd	5
They all had a slope	They all went to the right	sd	5
They all went up and to the right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Yeah they were positive	sd	4
Do this quickwrite for the remaining part of the class	On that same piece of paper	sd	1
Did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better	Same paper	sd	1
Or Y intercepts	Same paper	sd	1
Lets get that done	Can you check these	sd	1
Whats this skull and bones stuff	Dont know	sd	1
Dont know	Nice drawing	sd	1
Oh youre waiting for me because were done over here	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Let me let me see wh Let me see the answers	Theyre over here	sd	1
But wheres your own work Dell	I didnt know it was	sd	1
And right now what are you supposed to be doing	I was doing that	sd	1
I was doing that	He was doing this	sd	1
I understand but right now what are you supposed to be doing	We were waiting for you	sd	1
What did I talk about on the board there	This	sd	1
This	Quickwrite	sd	1
Quickwrite	The quickwrite	sd	1
Okay Jeremy	Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Mr Ormsby	Number six it says what do you notice about the intersection between	sd	1
Show me your equation two	Two is uh down here	sd	1
Those arrows mean they go on lines go on forever in both directions right	Oh yeah	b	1
What do you notice about the angles there	Its a right angle	sd	4
Have you guys heard about that before	Yeah	b	1
Right	Mm hm	sd	1
Mm hm	My pencil	sd	1
My pencil	Hi Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Hi Mr Ormsby	I screwed up on graph nine and	sd	4
Okay	Hes all	sd	1
Have you started your quickwrite yet Brittany	No because I was doing the graphing and Nathan has all the answers so I have to write down all the answers	sd	1
Just write as much as you can	I didnt learn anything	sd	1
Okay	I said  graph Im not gonna do it because I got messed up on the um	sd	1
I said  graph Im not gonna do it because I got messed up on the um	It looks nice	sd	1
It looks nice	That looks nice	sd	1
That looks nice	On the	sd	1
How come you crumpled it up	Because I messed up	sd	1
Oh so you got a new one	Yeah	b	1
So on Monday youre going to redo it	Im Im just trying to	sd	1
Make it look professional	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Do it all the way down	sd	1
Do it all the way down	Over on your weekend	sd	1
Okay	Im not going to be here	sd	1
Okay	Were getting our work done here look	sd	1
Do not lose any of it	Where are we	sd	1
Do not turn in anything today because youre going to need it all Monday	What do we do What do we do with this	sd	1
Can I trust you can your group trust you to fold that up and put it away somewhere	Nope	sd	1
Nope	in your backpack	sd	1
All right	What do we do with these	sd	1
Okay	Keep it till Monday in your backpack because if I take it Im going to lose it	sd	1
Okay	Mr Ormsby Im not going to be here all next weekend	sd	1
Mr Ormsby Im not going to be here all next weekend	Or all next week cause were going up to Seattle for um Thanksgiving	sd	1
Okay	And Im gonna be	sd	1
Youre le Youre not even going to be here Monday Tuesday or Wednesday	No cause	sd	1
No cause	DOG	aa	1
DOG	D Cat	sd	1
Okay	I will Ill be back um on the	sd	1
Leave your work with another group member then	Hey what do we do with this Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Have a good weekend	You too	sd	1
You too	Wait Mr Ormsby	sd	1
Wait Mr Ormsby	Im taking off	sd	1
Im taking off	That was fun	sd	1
Good	No	b	1
No	I had a blast	sd	1
I had a blast	But I actually learned something without goofing off	sd	1
Uh Ankur and Michelle think they have	We ve got a secret	sd	1
You have	But the things changed the equation other than the triangles	sd	4
But the things changed the equation other than the triangles	Things change almost the whole entire equation	sd	4
Do you want to come and write it and tell it to the camera	So the equation can change	sd	4
Well it s going to have to be different from this it wouldn t be that it ll be a different kind of equation	The only difference between this and that is	sd	1
The only difference between this and that is	Can you change the numbers in the triangle	sd	1
Can you change the numbers in the triangle	Please say yes	sd	1
Well there might actually be ways to do that too	We did that and it works the way I have it	sd	1
We did that and it works the way I have it	But the difference between one and four is three the difference between four and seven is three the difference between seven and ten is three that means that s going to be the first number three cause box times three But the pattern in this is one three five seven and nine so how are we going to	sd	5
Do you remember what you said	We re thinking what we should say	sd	1
Because remember you said something before	Just tell them what we got for the written answer not like the code	sd	1
The number outside the box had to be the same as the number inside the box	But that will give it away	sd	1
Oh no it wont	Well not exactly we didn t get the code right after we did that	sd	1
OK it would be worth listening because this is a very interesting idea and they re trying to be careful they re still giving you a chance to invent it but they re going to tell you something worth thinking about	They don t want to give us a chance	sd	1
They don t want to give us a chance	They just want to be smart and keep it from us	sd	1
They just want to be smart and keep it from us	Well this is what we got but you have to write it in the code	sd	1
Well can we get it quiet please Jeffery and everybody can we get it quiet please	The number you add after the bracket is always one	sd	4
Isn t that true a lot of people have decided on that	Yeah we got that	sd	2
Yeah we got that	And the number that is here is always the number that s in the box cause if you put zero here zero times zero is zero plus one equals one	sd	5
And the number that is here is always the number that s in the box cause if you put zero here zero times zero is zero plus one equals one	What about three	sd	3
What about three	Yeah but figure out the rest yourself	sd	2
Yeah but figure out the rest yourself	Jeff the number that goes here always goes here	sd	4
Jeff the number that goes here always goes here	You have to figure out what the code is	sd	4
OK wait a second can we get it quiet please because I want to hear what Michael is saying	For number three the difference between one and four is three the difference between four and seven is three too and the difference between seven and ten is three so that is going to be the first number but on number 6 the difference between one and two is one and the difference between two and five is three so which one goes in the box	sd	5
What you just said	Which ever number goes here	sd	1
Which ever number goes here	Yeah but the problem is	sd	1
Yeah but the problem is	Listen Mike this is zero and it goes in the box so it has to go here too	sd	5
Listen Mike this is zero and it goes in the box so it has to go here too	No but we re trying to find out what goes in the second	sd	2
No but we re trying to find out what goes in the second	In this in this	sd	2
In this in this	No no	ba	2
No no	If you put a one in here one times one is one plus one is two	sd	5
If you put a one in here one times one is one plus one is two	What goes here	sd	3
What goes here	Whatever goes in the box goes here if this is ten then ten goes here if this is five then five goes here	sd	5
Whatever goes in the box goes here if this is ten then ten goes here if this is five then five goes here	Whatever s in the box goes next	sd	2
Whatever s in the box goes next	And one always goes here	sd	2
And one always goes here	It works every time	sd	2
Let me keep track of where we stand because I m getting a little confused	We have to write a code	sd	1
We have to write a code	How we got it or something	sd	1
So Marcela explain	So diagonals are split into halves with the help of the Pythagorean theorem well figure out the length of each side	sd	4
The attribute of the diagonals youve explained one point is discovered is there any other	Its	sd	1
Yes that too we would certainly need it	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	It has all the sides the same	sd	4
So how do you explain or how do you convince us that this triangle	Because the diagonals are perpendicular to each other	sd	5
So Marcela speak out loud so everybody knows what youre writing on the board	Plus  divided by two	sd	4
Yes	A is equal to the second root of 12 divided by two and square the whole formula plus seven divided by two and square the second formula	sd	5
So when you substitute	A is equal to second root of six square	sd	4
Uh huh	Plus  plus three point five	sd	4
What is it	Twelve point twentyfive	sd	4
Twelve point twentyfive	Six point six point eight	sd	4
What did the calculator show you	Six point eight  nine four	sd	4
Okay okay so its six point you said eight	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Its six point nine	sd	4
So Marcela what else	is equal	sd	4
So well try it without a calculator what would it be	It is twentyseven point six	sd	4
So do you all have the same answer	Yes	b	2
Already yourself	I transferred it	sd	4
Id like to calculate the length of diagonal of this parallelepiped	So Im going to make a sketch	sd	4
So lets start with a sketch	A diagonal	sd	5
A diagonal	Ill inscribe the sides of the parallelepiped	sd	5
And you have to speak out loud so they can hear you all the way here in the back	A  B  C	sd	4
The edges yes	The edges	sd	1
The edges	Now Im going to calculate the side A G	sd	4
And now its up to you how were going to calculate it	So we will separate it on one side to A B C and well mark it as a rightangled triangle	sd	4
So you meant a wall not a side a wall yes so walls A B C and D we can use	A wall	sd	1
A wall	walls A B C D  a short diagonal to the right	sd	4
And loud Dan you have to speak out loud so we can understand what youre saying	So these are  A  B and this is going to be a diagonal lets call it for example X	sd	4
Yes	So now we can easily figure it out so X equals a root of A squared plus B squared because its a hypotenuse	sd	5
Yes	So X equals a root of 32 squared plus 46 squared	sd	4
So Dan take your calculator or over there on the table you can borrow one	So Ill write it down	sd	1
So Ill write it down	Its a root of 1024 plus 2016	sd	4
Uh huh	Ill add it together so its a root of 3140	sd	4
Yes	And the result is 56	sd	4
So by doing this we calculated what	A wall diagonal	sd	4
Okay what is next	Now	sd	1
Yes	So now we get a rightangled triangle A C G	sd	4
Yes so draw the triangle again	This is going to be A this is C and this is G and this is going to be  Y	sd	4
So this is clear	Rightangled	b	5
Rightangled	So this is practically the  C and this the wall diagonal X and we have to calculate the Y	sd	5
So this is practically the  C and this the wall diagonal X and we have to calculate the Y	So Y is equal because its a hypotenuse its a root of X squared plus C squared	sd	5
Yes	So Y is equal to the root of 56 squared plus 53 squared and Y is equal where is the calculator	sd	5
So you borrow this calculator again	So its the root of 3136 plus 2809 Y equals the root of 5945	sd	5
Uh huh	And that is seventyseven point one seventyseven point one centimeters	sd	4
So Dan before I let you go tell me how many decimeters it would be	Seven point seventyone decimeters	sd	4
Everybody has seen an easel	Two point what	sd	3
Katka	Rightangled	sd	4
Rightangled	Rightangled	sd	2
Good	I have already	sd	1
Is it the same	Yes	b	2
We agreed were going to have the measurements with one decimal space so well round the answer on two decimal spaces	On two	sd	1
So Marcela you start	Four plus three times two squared is four plus three times two and that is 16	sd	5
If there is any problem tell me right away	Four plus three times two squared that equals four plus six squared is equal to 40	sd	5
Yes that is 40 Dan	Four plus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to seven times two squared and that is 28	sd	5
Petra	Four plus three times two in parenthesis raised to the second power is equal to 100	sd	5
Petra did it very fast	Four minus three times two squared is equal to four minus 12 and that is minus eight	sd	5
Take another one	Four minus three times two squared is equal to four minus six squared and that is minus 32	sd	5
Jonas	Four minus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to one times four is four	sd	5
Martina	Four minus three times two in parenthesis squared is equal to four minus six all raised to the second power and that equals four	sd	5
So Jana talk and explain what youre doing there	So the parenthesis come first so its eight divided by four by four is 16 is eight divided by 16 minus two	sd	5
Jonas	Zero point five	sd	4
Where would you get the minus	I dont know	sd	3
Or anyone has the answer in a different form	One half	sd	4
So	So the root of four is two three divided so five	sd	5
So dont forget its equal at the beginning make another one at the beginning at the beginning so	Three divided by two is one point five five minus one point five is three point five	sd	5
So Jirka for you we have five plus and in the parenthesis three divided by four the parenthesis squared	So its five plus uh three divided by four is zero point uh	sd	5
So its five plus uh three divided by four is zero point uh	Seventyfive	sd	2
It looks a little weird	Seventyfive	sd	4
Now you tell me what youre going to do next with the formula when you should raise by two	So Im going to raise it by two	sd	4
How	Similar to the easel	sd	4
Shh shh stop that	Well well draw it	sd	4
What is this form called	This is a complex fraction	sd	4
How is it called	Mixed	sd	4
So Teresa come to do another one	But when we had the easel we did it differently	sd	1
Entirely the whole thing squared	Five minus three is two divided by the root of four is two and the whole formula squared	sd	5
Yes	So its two divided by two that is one squared and that is equal	sd	5
Read it	Fill in the blanks the correct answers of signs for bigger and smaller	sd	1
So Dada do the first one	So its two squared plus two squared is equal to two times two squared so two squared plus two squared is eight	sd	5
Eight	And two by two squared is also eight	sd	5
Petra	Two squared plus two cubed oh I have to do example B two cubed plus two cubed is bigger than three times two squared	sd	5
So	Because the cube of two plus the cube of two is 18	sd	5
So how much is the cube of two Petra	The cube of two is eight	sd	4
Eight so on the left side the answer is 16 and on the right side	And three by two squared is 12	sd	5
Twelve so	So the 16 is bigger than 12	sd	4
The left side is bigger than the right one Jitka	So two squared plus two cubed is equal to three by two squared	sd	5
So what did you get on the left side	So its basically four plus eight which is 12 and three by four is also 12	sd	5
So in example C we have say it one more time an equal symbol good Karin take another one	An equal symbol	sd	1
An equal symbol	Two cubed plus two squared will be eight plus four	sd	5
Jirka stop doing that	Which is 12 and that is smaller than two times two cubed because its like two times eight 16	sd	5
The sum of numbers three and five well convert into words how	Three plus five	sd	4
The difference between numbers four and minus eight	Four minus minus eight	sd	4
The product means what Misa	Multiplying	sd	4
And quotient	Dividing	aa	4
So Andrea try the first one	A four power of difference of numbers five and three	sd	4
Now look next to it how they wrote it down	Five minus three in the parenthesis to the fourth power	sd	5
So if were going to calculate it what do we have to do first	Put it in the parenthesis	sd	4
First we have to do the calculation in parenthesis and after that raise it to a certain power	Parenthesis and raise it to a certain power	sd	1
So what kind of calculating am I starting with in this word expression	With the power	sd	4
With the power which means with the process which were going to be using for calculating as the last one	The last one	sd	4
First we have to subtract and when we have the answer well raise it to a certain power okay	Raise it to a certain power	sd	4
Teresa	The difference of fourth powers of numbers five and three	sd	1
First we should calculate what	First were going to calculate the fourth power	sd	4
First were going to calculate the fourth powers and later the answers well subtract	Well subtract	aa	1
Do you understand that	Yes	b	1
Lucko read the next one	Five multiplied by the sum of the numbers 12 and three	sd	1
So if we want to calculate it first we start with what	First we calculate the parenthesis which is 12 plus three	sd	4
Twelve plus three and the answer we multiply it by five	Multiply by five	sd	1
The one before the last one	The square root of the sum of 11 and seven	sd	4
And now well read the last one so you have something to compare it to Pepo what is going to be the last one	The total sum of square roots of numbers 11 and seven	sd	1
When I start saying second root of the total so the main part is the big root mark	The root mark	sd	1
And in the last one you have the sum of the square roots	Square roots	sd	1
So always read what youve written down and after that what the answer is	The difference of numbers 15 and nine is 15 minus nine is six	sd	5
And the answer is	Its equal to six	sd	4
Marketa	Fifteen times nine is 135 and its a product of numbers 15 and nine	sd	5
So Dan read the next one	Sixtyfour divided by eight is eight	sd	1
Karin	Seventeen plus 12 is 29	sd	5
Alino	Fifteen plus two times nine is 33	sd	5
Dont forget about it lets remember it	The multiplication	aa	4
Jitko	In parenthesis 15 plus nine the end of parenthesis times four is equal to 96	sd	5
Dado	Two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis plus two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis	sd	5
So what is the answer	Fortyeight	sd	4
Are the parenthesis necessary there or we can get by without them	We have to have them	sd	4
Yes we have to have the parenthesis here so lets move on Katka	May I ask something	sd	1
May I ask something	About the multiplying by two	sd	1
About the multiplying by two	Does it matter if its in front of or after the parenthesis	sd	1
So Katko show me what we have here	If I look at the answer it doesnt matter but its written differently	sd	4
So tell me what you have there	Fifteen plus nine in parenthesis by two	sd	4
So its this way or what kind of different version did you want	Two by the whole parenthesis	sd	4
So	The answer is the same but if I write it the other way is there any difference	sd	1
How do we explain that the answer has to be the same no matter what way we write it down	Because its commutative	sd	5
Multiplying is commutative	Its commutative	sd	4
So we have also the last one	Fifteen times two plus nine times two is equal to 48	sd	5
Are they necessary or not	They are not	sd	4
So for you I have with the difference of numbers three and seven	May I write it with	sd	1
Petro there is the quotient of five and eight do you have it there	Now she does	sd	1
Now she does	Dont transcribe it into a fraction	sd	4
If its possible do it that way	Into a fraction or into a mixed number	sd	3
One whole number has how many eighths	Eight	sd	4
And four of them	Is thirtytwo	sd	4
So its minus thirtytwo eighths plus five eighths is	Minus 28	sd	4
Youll write it down and calculate it	So the	sd	1
Alright is everybody ready	Okay pick a number	sd	1
Okay pick a number	Oh oh	ba	1
Oh oh	Me me me	sd	1
Okay so does everyone see that when there is a one	Oh I know your rule already	aa	1
Oh I know your rule already	What	ba	1
What	By fifteen	sd	4
By fifteen	Nope	sd	2
Nope	Oh darn itSike I dont know	sd	1
Oh darn itSike I dont know	Do another one	sd	1
Do another one	I dont know I dont know	sd	1
I dont know I dont know	Lets do it in a row	sd	1
Lets do it in a row	Do it in a row	sd	1
Do it in a row	We get fortyfive	sd	4
We get fortyfive	Oh two yeah yeahyeah two	b	1
Oh two yeah yeahyeah two	Oh go three	sd	1
Oh go three	Go three	sd	1
Go three	Go three	sd	1
Go three	But why your by so big my  dude	sd	1
But why your by so big my  dude	Oh I almost got I think I get his rule	sd	1
Oh I almost got I think I get his rule	Nah go three	sd	1
Nah go three	No go four	sd	1
No go four	I mean go to three and then switch it up	sd	1
I mean go to three and then switch it up	This is  something like five	sd	1
Now before you write down 3 what do you think  its going to be	I think its going to be by ten I meant by ten	sd	4
I think its going to be by ten I meant by ten	By ten	sd	2
By ten	No its not by ten	sd	2
No its not by ten	It cant be by ten because he started off with  15	sd	5
It cant be by ten because he started off with  15	So I think it is	sv	1
So I think it is	Its fifteenLet me think a little while	sd	4
Its fifteenLet me think a little while	I think its I think its	sv	1
I think its I think its	No no no	sd	1
No no no	Go four go four go four	sd	1
Go four go four go four	Go four	sd	1
Go four	Stop drawing it so fast	sd	1
Stop drawing it so fast	Youre doing it too fast	sd	1
Youre doing it too fast	Oh I know whats next	sd	1
Oh I know whats next	Youre just youre just putting a five at  the end of each number	sd	2
Youre just youre just putting a five at  the end of each number	No its fourteen then its thirteen then its twelve	sd	4
No its fourteen then its thirteen then its twelve	Its fourteen then its twelve	sd	5
Its fourteen then its twelve	I mean two to twentytwo then  its	sd	5
I mean two to twentytwo then  its	I know the rule	sd	1
I know the rule	I know the rule now	sd	1
I know the rule now	Its by five	sd	5
Think of a rule that will  produce what you think the number for four  okay	Its by five	sd	5
Its by five	Its by five	sd	5
Its by five	Its by fifteen	sd	5
Its by fifteen	I think the rule	sv	1
I think the rule	I know the rule	sd	1
Sit down sit down	I know the rule	sd	1
I know the rule	The rule is like basically you got the same  thing	sd	5
The rule is like basically you got the same  thing	You get you doing the same numbers like 11 22 33 and  you just adding five to the same numbers	sd	5
You get you doing the same numbers like 11 22 33 and  you just adding five to the same numbers	You put forty I think  the next number you going to put is fortyfive	sd	5
You put forty I think  the next number you going to put is fortyfive	Yes	b	2
Yes	See	sd	1
See	Exactly Im too smart	sd	1
Okay but the his rule One one second hang on	Oh snap	sd	1
Oh snap	I get itYea I know the rule now	sd	1
You got to think what is the operation that he is using to  get the number	Hes just putting a five at the end of the number	sd	5
Hes just putting a five at the end of the number	I know basically you put a five at the end of each number	sd	2
I know basically you put a five at the end of each number	Times ten	sd	5
Times ten	Times ten	sd	2
Okay so does that work	Times ten	sd	5
Times ten	Thats half of it	sd	4
Thats half of it	Times five	sd	5
Does that work	Times ten divided by five	sd	5
Times ten divided by five	Times ten divided by five	sd	2

No	Times ten times ten times five	sd	5
See whether or not your rule see whether it  works	Times ten plus five	sd	5
Times ten plus five	No	b	2
No	Give me that marker	sd	1
Give me that marker	Times ten what	sd	3
Yup did he get it	Yea	b	2
Yea	Times ten what	sd	3
Times ten what	Plus five	sd	4
What what	Yea	b	1
Tell him what tell them what the rule was	Times ten plus five	sd	1
Times ten plus five	That was easy	sd	1
That was easy	Its times ten plus five	sd	1
Its times ten plus five	Oh that was easy	sd	1
Oh that was easy	I should have know that	sd	1
Okay lets see if you get them	I say whoever is talking  hes just stalling yo	sd	1
I say whoever is talking  hes just stalling yo	Oh I want to do one more	sd	1
Do you want to fill out the chart	Alright alright	b	1
Alright alright	Lets go Chris	sd	1
Lets go Chris	Lets go Chris	sd	1
Chris	Alright Im about to put the number guys	sd	1
Alright Im about to put the number guys	But you dont get one	sd	1
But you dont get one	You said if he No erase that put one	sd	1
You said if he No erase that put one	Put a triangle two	sd	1
Put a triangle two	You go to put	sd	1
Alright does everyone see what happens to ten	Yea times two	sd	4
What number do you want to try  now	Oh two two two	sd	1
Oh two two two	Two two	sd	1
Two two	Hey hold on wait	sd	1
Hey hold on wait	Be quiet I think I know this	sd	1
Be quiet I think I know this	No two	sd	1
No two	Not 20	sd	1
Not 20	2	b	1

Okay dont put the answer yet	Its ten	sd	4
What do you think the answer is going to be	Oh let him finish	sd	1
Oh let him finish	Go go go	sd	1
Go go go	Its got to be easy cause he finished to quick	sd	1
Its got to be easy cause he finished to quick	Times times four	sd	5

Times two times two	I said that when they had the ten	sd	5
I said that when they had the ten	Hahahaha what is that	sd	3
Hahahaha what is that	Thats twelve	ba	4
Thats twelve	Why you switch it up man	sd	1
Why you switch it up man	Oh I know it anyways	sd	1
Oh I know it anyways	What is it	sd	3
What is it	Plus ten	sd	5
Plus ten	Plus ten	sd	5
If youre a black card Id like for you to share first	12 so yeah okay	b	4
12 so yeah okay	This ones wrong and I think	sd	4
This ones wrong and I think	and the rest make sense	sd	4
and the rest make sense	this ones wrong but these two make sense	sd	4
this ones wrong but these two make sense	So then does that make sense	sd	4
So then does that make sense	Because 18 18 18 18 18	sd	5
Because 18 18 18 18 18	And this one makes sense because it says 3 dollars per month so then thered be 369121518 21 24	sd	5
And this one makes sense because it says 3 dollars per month so then thered be 369121518 21 24	Then the Online Flix is wrong because its supposed to be 12	sd	5
Then the Online Flix is wrong because its supposed to be 12	Yeah its supposed to be 12 plus 1 for 1 rental	sd	5
Yeah its supposed to be 12 plus 1 for 1 rental	So 12 13 14 15 16	sd	1
So 12 13 14 15 16	And then right here it says 12 25 38	sd	5
Lets start with Kyle	I think it does make mathematical sense because with 12 if you add 13 to that its 25 and if you add 14 to 25 its 38 and 38 plus 15 is 51 and so on	sd	5
Um Debra	It does well it does make mathematical sense but it doesnt follow the plan	sd	4
So could you tell me which one does make mathematical sense and does follow the plan and which one or ones dont follow	Movie Busters and Mail Flix follow the plan and Online Flix doesnt	sd	4
Would you like to add to that Victoria	Um actually theres a problem with it  cause it says number of movies zero	sd	5
Um actually theres a problem with it  cause it says number of movies zero	And it says Online Flix and Mail Flix 18 and 12	sd	5
And it says Online Flix and Mail Flix 18 and 12	But youre really not paying for anything right now so why should you pay that much now without without any movies right now	sd	5
Or about 0	About the 0	sd	4
Okay do you want to talk about 0 then	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I think that it does make sense because the 12 the Online Flix you have to pay 12 per month and so that would be you would havent rent no movies but you still have to pay for the month on each one	sd	5
Okay so if we rented 0 movies from Online Flix youre saying we would still have to pay the 12	Yeah	b	1
Okay even though I dont have anything	Yeah	b	1
Jocelyn	Um it doesnt really make sense because like Movie Busters see how all the way down it adds 3	sd	5
Uh huh	Well on Online Flix when we were having our partner talking we were looking at the 0 how it added 3 and how 18 added nothing it stayed	sd	5
Well on Online Flix when we were having our partner talking we were looking at the 0 how it added 3 and how 18 added nothing it stayed	Well 12 plus 12 isnt 25	sd	5
Well 12 plus 12 isnt 25	And so on	sd	5
Someone want to add to this conversation	Well like for Online Flix for each movie like 13 and 14 and so on and so on like Online Flix it says uh those like other numbers	sd	5
Well like for Online Flix for each movie like 13 and 14 and so on and so on like Online Flix it says uh those like other numbers	but if you take 13 and add it to 12 you get 25	sd	5
but if you take 13 and add it to 12 you get 25	And then from 25 if you add like 13 more dont you get 38	sd	5
Yes	And it keeps going	sd	4
So then were adding by what here Hailey	13	b	4
Danielle	12 plus 12 equals 24 but if you buy one movie it equals 25	sd	5
So the two flat fees of 12 plus the 1 makes the 25	Yes	b	1
So is there would anyone else like to share about whether or not it makes mathematical sense	I think it does make mathematical sense because they all match the plan	sd	5
Amir	I think it does make mathematical sense but I think theres something that I dont see really correctly	sd	5
I think it does make mathematical sense but I think theres something that I dont see really correctly	So 12 plus 12 equals 24	sd	5
So 12 plus 12 equals 24	But why are we adding 1 to it	sd	3
Could someone answer Amirs question	Because you pay 1 per movie	sd	5
Okay can everybody look up	Six seven eight we got eight	sd	4
Okay now before I say anything does anybody want to  change their minds	Yes	b	1
What did you get now	Its less there is only eight	sd	4
How come	Well because once you take these apart you start to see that	sv	5
Well because once you take these apart you start to see that	The match	sd	2
The match	Because one took it off and made a whole difference	sd	5
How many of them were a match	Eight	sd	4
Michelle	Its	sd	1
Michelle	Because there is	sd	1
Okay what about	1 We think its less	sv	4
Okay what about	2 We said it was less and eight	sd	4
Why do you  think so	Because you take one off the bottom and one off the top  you might have another that is same as that	sd	5
Because you take one off the bottom and one off the top  you might have another that is same as that	And then you  have to make like things that you cant use them because its  a match and they have to be different	sd	5
And Brian how did you figure that	Well because first of all you could choose to do it the math  problem	sd	5
Well because first of all you could choose to do it the math  problem	Sixteen minus eight is eight	sd	5
You mean there is something about math to it	Yeah because sixteen minus eight or eight plus eight equals  sixteen	sd	5
Yeah because sixteen minus eight or eight plus eight equals  sixteen	And when you take one away from each it would  be one minus one minus one minus because its sixteen  minus eight or eight plus eight	sd	5
calls on a student	We changed our minds to less	sd	4
And Jamie said there would be the same	I dont know why I did that	sd	1
Can everybody agree  now there is less	Yes	b	1
What do you think	Oh I think they are the same	sd	4
Are you Jeff	No hes Jeff	sd	1
So you re saying so how would you do for eight	For eight	aa	1
So why did you pick thirtyfour	Because um ten steps is thirtyfour	sd	5
How would you do for four how would you do for eight	For eight	aa	1
Using the same idea	What	ba	1
What	Eight what	aa	3
A ladder with eight steps	One two three four five six seven eight	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight	Ah here I go	sd	1
Ah here I go	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twenty four twentyfive twentysix	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twenty four twentyfive twentysix	Ahh	aa	1
Ahh	One two three four five six seven eight	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight	How the heck	sd	1
How the heck	Any questions	sd	1
So how many did you find	Because the four steps  One two three four	sd	1
Because the four steps  One two three four	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	Take this whole thing off right	sd	4
Take this whole thing off right	Do you know an easier way	sd	1
Do you know an easier way	You have four steps right	sd	4
You have four steps right	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	Now one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	sd	1
How many is that	So the rods   you multiply by two	sd	4
So the rods   you multiply by two	But when you add four more you add three more steps for each one	sd	5
But when you add four more you add three more steps for each one	So for another step that s three blocks for another step there that s three blocks and that equals twelve so fourteen plus twelve is twenty six	sd	5
So for another step that s three blocks for another step there that s three blocks and that equals twelve so fourteen plus twelve is twenty six	Nice	aa	1
Nice	So these two must be wrong	sd	4
So these two must be wrong	Which one	aa	3
Which one	Oh the ten one	sd	3
Oh the ten one	Then you d have to multiply that by thirty	sd	5
Then you d have to multiply that by thirty	Yeah I had to multiply that by thirty and then divide it by five which is that six and then seventeen times six	sd	5
Yeah I had to multiply that by thirty and then divide it by five which is that six and then seventeen times six	And that s how you get the answer	sd	1
Are we sure that it s right now	Three twelve	sd	4
Three twelve	I got to go at 330 Or else I ll be stuck	sd	1
I got to go at 330 Or else I ll be stuck	How many steps we got One two three four five six seven eight nine ten	sd	1
Which one you are doing now	Thirty I give up man	sd	4
Thirtytwo for what	For this one the ten steps	sd	4
You have got ten steps there	Yeah	b	1
So thirtytwo and how many you said you had for a hundred	For a hundred steps three hundred and forty so it will be three twenty	sd	5
What did you do to get the number of rods for a ladder with ten and then hundred	Oh a ladder with ten	sd	1
Oh a ladder with ten	I just did five and then I multiplied and we have seventeen rods and then I did that again and it was thirtyfour	sd	5
I just did five and then I multiplied and we have seventeen rods and then I did that again and it was thirtyfour	So then I went over here and thirtyfour times ten	sd	5
Where is this thirtyfour come from	The rods	sd	4
The rods	It is wrong	sd	4
It is wrong	It is thirtytwo	sd	4
We have to find a way to be able to tell how many rods no matter what number of steps	I don t know now	aa	1
I don t know now	I just noticed like I just multiplied by two and subtract two	sd	4
Say for eight what would you do then for eight	For eight	aa	1
Using that multiply by two what would you do	It d be fourteen for four then times two	sd	4
Why don t you write it down	That is twenty eight then just minus two is twenty six because that is the real one twentysix	sd	5
So why fourteen	Because there is fourteen rods for four	sd	5
For fourOh four so I ask you about eight	First I did that and then since four times two is eight because you multiply it by two	sd	5
So how about for sixteen	Sixteen	aa	1
Hmm	It will twentysix plus twentysix is twelve it s fiftytwo	sd	5
Where does that twentysix come from	The number of these	sd	4
The number of these	No	b	1
No	That s wrong	sd	4
That s wrong	It is fifty	sd	4
I don t get this	Because here for eight times two is sixteen	sd	5
Because here for eight times two is sixteen	So one is twentysix so I multiplied twentysix by two and I got fiftytwo so then I subtracted two it is fifty	sd	5
Are you saying you multiplied here	Huh	b	3
Did you multiply here	Yeah	b	1
Can you write here	I did it over here	sd	1
I did it over here	Twentysix twentysix	sd	4
Oh twentysix times two and go on go on and what do you get	Twentysix times two is fifty two and I am subtracting two minus two and that is fifty	sd	5
So that works all the time	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Hold on man	sd	1
Before we do it can we find using this how will you do it	Using what	sd	3
Using what	That	aa	3
Yeah	for six	sd	1
For seven	OK for seven	sd	1
OK for seven	For eight it is twentysix	sd	5
For eight it is twentysix	So for that I would add three that is twentynine	sd	5
So for that I would add three that is twentynine	Twentythree	sd	4
Twentythree	Twentynine	sd	4
Twentynine	Oh yeah yeah	b	1
Oh yeah yeah	Twentythree twentythree	sd	4
So how many you have for seven	I subtracted three from twentysix	sd	4
Well but you are doing differently now right	Yeah	b	1
Because here you are doing like this you are multiplying   so if I give you like a ladder for a certain number of steps then how you go about computing that   finding out the number of rods if you did not want to build them	I take half of the number if it has a half I will multiply it by two and subtract two	sd	5
So like for ten how would you do that	I think a ladder of five then count the rods multiply that by two and subtract two	sd	5
How would you do that for nine	For nine I would do eight then I would multiply the number by two and then I would subtract two and then I would add three	sd	5
For nine I would do eight then I would multiply the number by two and then I would subtract two and then I would add three	I sit right here	sd	1
That yeah that can work the same for you	Its on	sd	1
Its on	You got no homework	sd	1
I guess I better put the lights back on	Miss  I have a	sd	1
What	My homework	sd	1
Okay get your assignment and go ahead and put it away for now	Oh my gosh	sd	1
Oh my gosh	The next assignment	sd	1
Okay	Miss  are we Do we need paper	sd	1
Yes	Do you have some paper	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Yes Austin	Do you want us to put our folders up  put it in	sd	1
I will give you a sheet that were gonna work on today that you can take notes on	Okay	b	1
The only thing you need on your desk is this piece of paper Im gonna give you and a pencil	Do we need a calculator	sd	1
No	Want our book	sd	1
Send that five to that other group back there	I forgot my book at home	sd	1
I forgot my book at home	Im a bad girl	sd	1
Okay	Where do I sit	sd	1
Where do I sit	Right there	aa	1
Right there	Right there	aa	1
You didnt get one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	He has one	sd	1
He has one	Yeah	b	1
Now two to the fourth is how much	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Thats	sd	1
So two to the fifth would be how much	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Twentyfive	sd	2
Twentyfive	No	b	2
No	Twenty	sd	4
Look at the growth	Its very big	sd	4
Two to the three was	Eight	sd	4
What do you think that graphs gonna look like	It a curve	sd	4
Yes	Become a parabola if you go to the negative side	sd	4
If we think about this what does two squared mean	Two times two	sd	4
And what does two cubed mean	Two times two times two	sd	4
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	sd	4
What would this equal	Two to the fifth power	sd	4
What is this telling me now that I have parentheses	You have to multiply it by	sd	4
You have to multiply it by	You have to do	sd	1
Two to the third power times two to the	Third power	sd	4
We have because its squared	What	ba	3
Right	Is is that the same thing as doing two to the third power and then just like getting the answer	sd	4
Two	Times two	sd	4
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	sd	1
And what do we get here if I write it as a final power	Two to the sixth power	sd	4
Now for the last example whats being squared here	The X	sd	4
The X	One X	sd	2
One X	The two	sd	2
The two	Two X	sd	2
Both of them	This is	sd	4
This is	Two X	sd	2
Two times X times two times	X	b	4
Right	Oh	b	1
Is that any different	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
And this is two squared times	X squared	sd	4
X squared	X squared	sd	2
Okay	Oh	b	1
Expand those out like I did on the board please	Can I  by expanding	sd	4
Can I  by expanding	Right	b	2
Good	Okay	b	1
And then give us the final answer	So you want us to just tree branch off and just	sd	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Yes Brett	Just asking am I doing it right	sd	1
Just asking am I doing it right	Is that right	aa	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Discuss it with your group	Do we do you want us to do our rule thing too	sv	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	I already know what	sd	1
I already know what	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	sd	4
Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	No	sd	2
No	Otherwise you just	sd	1
Otherwise you just	No	b	2
No	Youre not	sd	1
Okay	Well yeah that too but what did you guys get for the rule	sd	3
Did you come up with a rule	You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	sd	4
You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	I I understand	sd	1
If you say youre gonna add exponents how would you write that	A plus N equals equals	sd	4
Whats your base in this problem	A	b	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Did I do this right	sd	1
Very good	You would say add the exponents	sd	4
You would say add the exponents	The exponents to	sd	2
The exponents to	Add the exponents to find your base	sd	2
So youre just saying that youre gonna yeah	To find your base exponent	sd	4
To find your base exponent	Or how would you say add the add the exponents	sd	3
Or how would you say add the add the exponents	How would you what would you call it	aa	3
Add the exponents is sufficient	Add the exponents	sd	1
Add the exponents	So you have to add the exponents	sd	4
So then show me that	you know how to spell it right	sd	1
Robert what did you find out	What oh I was gonna ask you a question	sd	1
Ask the question	Do we have to write it in words	sd	1
You can you can do it in symbols Robert	Okay	b	1
Okay	In that case we are	sd	1
If I A to the M times A to the N what did we find out when we multiplied	A to the M plus N	sd	4
What did you get Chad	A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	sd	4
A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	No thats not right	sd	2
No thats not right	No	b	2
So then you found so how would I do it if I had A to the two to the four	You would A to the sixth	sd	4
You would A to the sixth	So you just add it	sd	1
What does parentheses stand for in math	Multiplication	aa	4
So would someone seeing this say oh multiplication or addition do you think	Multiplication	aa	4
Multiplication	Multiplication	aa	2
How can I show it such that its being added	What Robert says	sd	2
So are yes Austin	I got A and then 27	sd	4
On which problem	On the rule	sd	1
On the rule	For the rule	sd	1
Okay	I said N is A to N to the A B Cs is 13	sd	5
Right	Yeah	b	1
Cause if you look at the first problem we had A square times A to the fourth and we got A to the	Sixth	aa	4
So two plus one is	Three	sd	4
For number two	Yeah	b	1
So three plus one plus four is	Eight	sd	4
Cause when you expand it youll be able to see the pattern much more quickly	Okay	b	1
Okay	Three A two two	sd	4
Three A two two	Miss	sd	1
Yes	When you do this three you break that	sv	4
Whats in the inside part	The two A squared	sd	4
And how many times would you have A squared	Three oh three times	sd	4
Three oh three times	Oh three times	sd	2
So write that out	you would break it down and right	sd	4
Can you break that down even further now	I did	sd	1
Whats A squared look like	A times A	sd	4
And then you have to have how many sets of those	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
Three	Three	sd	2
So then you write that out and youve expanded it	Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	sd	5
Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	So it would be A to the sixth	sd	5
A to the	So it would be A to the	sd	4
So make sure you expand it out	Thats	ba	1
Thats	Thats what I got	sd	1
Lucia did you have a question	Oh I get it	sd	1
Oh I get it	I get it	sd	1
I get it	No I was asking the same thing as she did but I heard you explain it	sd	1
Whats that	How you Im gonna just write it three times write this three times	sd	1
Then how do you break out for your A squared	Two As	sd	4
Right	Yeah	b	1
So how many As do you end up with	A to the sixth	sd	4
A to the sixth	So then itll be A to the sixth	sd	4
So then itll be A to the sixth	He got A to the fifth	sd	2
He got A to the fifth	How did you all get six As	sd	3
How did you all get six As	I got five As	sd	4
I got five As	Because two times three is six	sd	5
Did you do okay	And thats  six	sd	4
Show him	So see you do	sd	1
Explain to Chad how that works	Here	sd	1
Here	If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	sd	5
If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	sd	5
cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	So basically I isnt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	sd	4
So basically I isnt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	The number by that	sd	4
So youre gonna multiply your exponents right	Yeah	b	1
Did you guys have it	So you multiplied the two and three and got six	sd	5
So you multiplied the two and three and got six	Yep	b	1
Yep	Yeah	b	1
You have your rule	Oh	sd	1
Dont forget to do your rule if you have determined it with your group	All right	aa	1
Yes	Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	sd	4
Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	Can we show it anyway we want	sd	1
Thats thats exactly yes	Hi	b	1
Hi	Im on TV	sd	1
Yes	How do you do this one	qy	3
How do you do this one	It said like	sd	1
It said like	So on number five we	sd	1
Right	Yeah	b	1
And how many times do you need A squared	Three	sd	4
Dont you need three A squares	This one	sd	1
Dont look at that bottom part	Oh	b	1
What does that look like	Isnt it She says that like Didnt you do it this way	sd	1
No	Thats what	sd	1
What whats being cubed here	Three	sd	4
Whats being cubed here	Oh	b	1
Whats in the parentheses	Three twos	sd	4
So write three A twos for me	Three A twos	sd	4
Three A twos	Oh	b	1
Cause isnt that dont you have A squared three times	Oh I get it	sd	1
Write three A twos out	Three A twos	sd	1
Isnt this A two A squared times A squared times A squared	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	So this is wrong	sd	1
So this is wrong	You have A squared A squared like that	sd	4
Now can you break those down further	So its A six	sd	4
You guys okay with the same logic and see if you see a pattern	Okay Mrs Scott	sd	1
Yes	Its A to the sixth power	sd	4
Its A to the sixth power	I dont understand that	sd	3
I dont understand that	I dont	sd	1
How many As is it	Three	sd	4
So write A times A times A	Okay	b	1
So what do you write	Another	sd	1
Another	Where did you get another	sd	3
Thats right	Oh	b	1
Break it out	Oh we have to keep going	sd	1
Oh we have to keep going	So we cant just stop right there	sd	1
So how many As do you have	Well how what about the two	sd	3
Well how what about the two	Where did we get the two from	sd	3
A to the three	Yeah	b	1
So A three times A three is that	Oh twice	ba	4
Oh twice	Huh	b	3
Okay	Do we really have to break them down the whole way	sd	1
Lets go	Yeah	b	1
I just want to know what the answer to number four is	A to the sixth	sd	4
Now what did you get over here Phoebe for number five	A to the sixth	sd	4
And Roberts group what did you get for number six	A to the eighth	sd	4
Did someone find a rule	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
Chris what did you find out	A to the M times N or A to the MN	sd	4
When we have an exponent within parentheses raised to an exponent we get A to the what	A to the M times N or A to the MN	sd	4
Then well let them know cause Ive I already got	And then A five times A five	sd	4
And then A five times A five	And then A four times A four	sd	2
Okay	You just put the exponent after the number	sd	4
Okay	So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	sd	5
So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	Right	b	1
Write that down what you said you think it is	What	ba	3
Right	A A A times B B B	sd	4
So you asked me is it the same as what	A B	sd	4
A B	Okay	b	1
Okay	So it would be A B times A B times A B	sd	4
So it would be A B times A B times A B	Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	sd	1
Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	How do you combine it	qy	3
Okay	Those arent the same	sd	4
How many As do I have	Three and three	sd	4
It is	No	b	1
That says to me A times B times B times B	A three B three	sd	4
Cause this is when you asked me	Right	b	1
Right	I told you	aa	1
Yes	So this would be right and	sd	1
Try to develop your rule if you can too with your group	How do you keep You just combine them	sv	4
How do you keep You just combine them	Right	b	1
Is that the problem I gave you	No	b	1
I dont see you writing this out in expanded form	All right	aa	1
Yes	Am I doing this right	sd	1
Yes	Oh	b	1
Oh	Miss	sd	1
Yes	I told you brat	sd	1
I told you brat	I dont understand the next step	sd	3
I dont understand the next step	Okay	b	1
Okay	So far I  A times B so thatd be A B	sd	4
Okay	And then its times three	sd	4
Yeah	So A times A B A B A B	sd	4
So A times A B A B A B	What do I do next	sd	3
So how many As do you have	Three As and three Bs	sd	4
Three As and three Bs	Three As	sd	2
Three As	And three Bs	sd	2
That says one A and three Bs	Is this right	aa	1
Is this right	Oh	b	1
Oh	One A and three Bs	sd	4
A to the one times B to the three	Thats not what I have	sd	4
Thats not what I have	I have this	sd	4
I have this	Oh what	ba	3
Oh what	Is it A cubed	sd	4
Is it A cubed	Well would it be like	sd	1
How many As do you have	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
So whats whats	A	b	4
A	A cubed times	sd	2
A cubed times	A cubed times A cubed	sd	2
A cubed times A cubed	And thats thats	sd	1
And thats thats	So then I was right	sd	1
Yeah	Oh	b	1
Oh	So A B times to the third isnt right	sd	4
So A B times to the third isnt right	Would it be  or would it be times that	sd	3
Would it be  or would it be times that	Is that right Ms Scott	sd	1
Thats thats fine	A cubed times B cubed	sd	4
Uhhuh	So A cubed times	sd	4
Cant it	Sure	b	1
Yes Phoebe	Okay	b	1
Okay	I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	sd	5
I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	and then other times youd put it B times B times B	sd	5
How many As do you have	A or A cubed	sd	4
Times what	Times B cubed	sd	4
Times B cubed	So would that be the answer or would I put A B cubed	sd	3
Write A B cubed for me	Five times and then times B times B times B	sd	4
How many As is that	Three	sd	4
Wheres the three on the A	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	So youd have to put A cubed plus B cubed	sd	4
Are we did I tell you to plus	No	b	1
What are we doing	Times	sd	4
Times	Multiplying	sd	2
And what other way	And the little dot thing	sd	4
And what other way	Times the X	sd	4
Times the X	The X	sd	2
And what other way	I dont know	sd	1
Well if I write A B what does that mean	A times B	sd	4
So you can just have them next to each other right	Yeah	b	1
And that still means multiplication	And then would I put like A B cubed or A cubed and B cubed	sd	3
Yep	What	ba	3
What	A cubed and B cubed	sd	3
A cubed and B cubed	Is that what I would do	sd	1
Uhhuh	Like	sd	1
Like	I mean B cubed	sd	4
I mean B cubed	Is that what I would put	sd	1
Uhhuh	Thats the answer	sd	4
Thats the answer	Thats how I would get it	sd	1
See the other ones	So we put it in parentheses	sd	4
So we put it in parentheses	Oh that doesnt help	sd	1
Robert how would we rewrite that	A B Cubed	aa	4
And on eight Courtney the quantity A B to the fifth power	A to the fifth times B to the fifth	sd	4
A B	Its A to the fourth and B to the fourth	sd	4
Did someone find the rule	We did	sd	1
Blake	Its A to M times B to M	sd	4
One right	One yeah	b	1
Right	So	b	1
So	So	b	1
So	What do we do with the one	sd	3
Okay	Multiply it	sd	4
Right	Thats all you write	sd	1
This is saying I have four over two how many times	Three	sd	4
So how many fours do I have	Three	sd	4
And how many twos do I have	Three	sd	4
Three	Oh thats pretty easy	ba	1
Okay	Thats all we have to do	sd	1
Section four problems 10 through 12	Oh my gosh	sd	1
Oh my gosh	I feel so stupid	sd	1
I feel so stupid	How does this one look	sd	1
How does this one look	For section	sd	1
Thats wrong	Isnt it A	sd	4
And he wrote three	Oh	b	1
Oh	I wrote three too	sd	2
So how many As would be left	Three	sd	2
Three	Three cause right there	sd	2
Three cause right there	One two three	sd	2
Yeah	Three	sd	4
Three	Yeah cause theres three	sd	2
See if you come up with a rule on that one	A to the fourth power	sd	4
A to the fourth power	How do we do  like that	sd	1
How do we do  like that	I dont understand how to do that one	sd	3
So write out A six As	Okay	b	1
Okay	This is Cynthia	sd	1
This is Cynthia	Uhhuh	b	1
Uhhuh	Did you get A to third	sd	1
Did you get A to third	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	Right	b	1
And whats it being divided by	A to the second	sd	4
Okay	So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	sd	4
So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	So its two A squared	sd	4
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	A fourth	sd	2
A fourth	A fourth	sd	2
A fourth	So then its just A to the fourth	sd	2
So then its just A to the fourth	He was the smart one	sd	1
And A times	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay I got it	sd	1
Yes	Would you add these together the four and the four	sd	4
Whats the denominator	Oh	sd	1
How many As are supposed to be down there	Okay	b	1
Okay	Is this right Miss Scott	sd	1
Is this right Miss Scott	Did you do A to the sixth and A to the	sd	1
Okay	Is this A to the fourth	sd	1
Whats left here	I still dont get how its down by four	sd	3
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	sd	4
A to the fourth	Oh I got the rule now	sd	1
Oh I got the rule now	Okay	b	1
You get Does that make sense to you	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Miss Scott is this right	sd	1
Miss Scott is this right	Did you get A to the sixth on top and then A	sd	4
Yep	And then	sd	1
Yep	Does the answer equal A to the	sd	4
Does the answer equal A to the	And this ones A	sd	4
And this ones A	Right	b	1
Right	Cause	b	1
Lets look at problem	You just add them	sd	4
You just add them	You just add them	sd	2
Dominic what did you get for the answer to problem number 10	A to the fourth	sd	4
Sam on number 11 what answer did you get	A to the third	sd	4
Chelsea what did you get	A	b	4
Lucia	A to the M minus N	sd	4
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
So go ahead and do 13 through 15 quickly	Oh	b	1
Yes	I need help	sd	1
I need help	How do you get it	qy	1
How do you get it	Oh yes I do	aa	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	So first you expand it out right	sd	4
So first you expand it out right	You get A times A times A over B times B times B	sd	5
You get A times A times A over B times B times B	So wouldnt it equal A over B	sd	5
So wouldnt it equal A over B	I dont know	sd	1
Well how many As do you have	Three	sd	4
So how do you write that	Oh so it wouldnt be A cubed over B cubed	sd	4
Try the next one and see if you see a pattern develop	A times	sd	4
A times	That was really really	sd	1
That was really really	B times B	sd	4
B times B	So now what would that equal	sd	3
So now what would that equal	Zero or would it just equal A	sd	3
Zero or would it just equal A	Yeah	b	1
Yes	Miss Scott am I doing this right	sd	1
Miss Scott am I doing this right	Miss Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	sd	3
Miss Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	Cause they all	sd	1
Okay	To three	sd	4
To three	Three	sd	2
So its A over	Third	sd	4
Third	So itd be right	aa	1
Okay	But those both canc the thirds cancel out so itd just be A over B	sd	5
They do	Couldnt it be one	sd	4
How do you know that	I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	sd	5
I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	Because	sd	1
But whats to the third power	But you dont know	sd	1
A	A and B	sd	4
A and B	So its still So theyre different	sd	4
So its still So theyre different	So its just A over B	sd	4
Are they like terms	Nnhnh	aa	1
So can we combine unlike terms	Nnhnh	aa	1
Right	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Okay	So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	sd	3
So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	Its A to the third B to the third	sd	4
Its A to the third B to the third	But Miss Scott did you say	sd	1
But Miss Scott did you say	Couldnt that still be A over B though	sd	4
Couldnt that still be A over B though	Ms Scott	sd	1
Yes Im listening Lucia	You said it was  like this is all one	sd	1
You said it was  like this is all one	Didnt you because	sd	1
So So how many As do you have	Three	sd	4
Three	Oh	b	1
What would I have	Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	sd	4
Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	Right	b	1
Right	Cause theyre both	sd	1
Whats A What Whats Whats A over A	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	It would still be	sd	1
It would still be	A over	sd	4
If I had three of those what would I have	Three	sd	4
Well whats one times one times one	A to the third	sd	4
A to the third	Oh	b	1
Oh	One yeah	b	2
One yeah	Three	sd	2
So if if the denominator was the same variable as the numerator yes we could simplify it	Mhhm	b	1
What is our answer Robert	A to the third over B to the third	sd	4
Number 14 Austin	A over the A to the five over B to the five	sd	4
And number 15 Rachelle	A to the sixth and B over B to the six	sd	4
Cristie	A M	sd	4
And I want you to prove that A to the negative N is equal to one over A to the N	This is math homework for tonight	sd	1
Youll present it to me tomorrow in class	What if we dont know	sd	1
What if we dont know	Do we have to	sd	1
Do we have to	Are you serious	qy	1
So start working on that	All right	aa	1
Do you need me Robert	If A equals one over	sd	4
If A equals one over	I dont get that	sd	3
I dont get that	A equals zero is another one right	sd	4
A equals zero is another one right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So youre gonna keep plugging A in	sd	4
So youre gonna keep plugging A in	Oh no because lookit	sd	1
Oh no because lookit	A to the zero is A to the zero	sd	4
A to the zero is A to the zero	So if you dont	sd	1
So if you dont	If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	sd	5
If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	sd	3
Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	Yes	b	1
Yes	See yes were right	aa	1
See yes were right	Okay	b	1
Okay	I can do A minus  right	sd	4
Yes	You you have the question	sd	1
You you have the question	Okay no	b	1
Okay no	Okay well it would this be okay	sd	1
Okay well it would this be okay	You know zero times everything is zero right	sd	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	sd	4
But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	Like never mind	sd	1
Like never mind	Youre not making much sense	sd	1
Youre not making much sense	Never mind	sd	1
Never mind	Ryan made it sound better	sd	1
Ryan made it sound better	I always	sd	1
Work out some sample problems and see if you can come out and prove to me why A to the zero is one	A Because A is one	sd	5
Think about using those rules	That like just went right over my head	sd	4
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay guys	b	1
Okay guys	He says that A zero plus N equals one	sd	2
He says that A zero plus N equals one	Thats not right	aa	2
Thats not right	What	ba	3
What	Isnt that zero not one	sd	4
A to the zero power equals one	Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	sd	4
Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	Wouldnt it be zero	sd	2
Wouldnt it be zero	Unless you can	sd	1
Unless you can	Because anything times zero is zero	sd	5
Because anything times zero is zero	Right	b	1
Right	But we have to prove to her why its one	sd	1
But we have to prove to her why its one	Unless you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	sd	5
Unless you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	Its not one though	sd	4
Its not one though	Reciprocolated it	sd	1
Reciprocolated it	Thatll still be zero	sd	4
Okay	I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	sd	5
I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	sd	1
Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	So then how could it be one	sd	3
So then how could it be one	Divide by zero	sd	4
What do we know about the rule of one	How are we gonna do these	sd	3
How are we gonna do these	A by negative	sd	4
You have a question	We never learned these	sd	1
We never learned these	The negative ones	sd	1
The negative ones	Remember	sd	1
Remember	We never learned these	sd	1
Yes	Hi	b	1
Hi	Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	sd	4
Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	Right	b	1
Right	So it would just be one	sd	4
What if A was a million	Huh	b	1
Huh	A million	sd	4
Lets say our A was equal to a million	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	Cause it would be equal to six	sd	4
Cause it would be equal to six	Huh	b	3
Huh	A million and one	sd	4
A million and one	Equals six	sd	4
Equals six	How do you	qy	1
And they So six to the zero power is one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And any	sd	1
And any	How	aa	3
How	Cause anything is one	sd	5
How	But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	sd	5
But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	Like if you had six times zero it says that youre not multiplying anything  zero	sd	5
But were dealing were dealing with powers now	Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	sd	1
Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	So itd be A times C	sd	4
So itd be A times C	Oh I know	sd	1
Oh I know	Cause its only one of these	sd	1
Cause its only one of these	Thats what I was trying to say	sd	1
Thats what I was trying to say	Is that it	sd	1
Is that it	Its only one A because there	sd	4
Youre getting youre on the right track	Cause its only one	sd	5
Cause its only one	Its not	sd	2
Start thinking about it in terms of multiplication and division now	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
Yes	I really dont get this	sd	3
I really dont get this	Instead of even if you you were like	sd	1
Instead of even if you you were like	Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	sd	5
Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	If it if like	sd	1
If it if like	Cause if  A were a number	sd	1
Cause if  A were a number	Cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero right	sd	5
That its being multiplied	It says A to the  power	sd	4
Does A to the zero mean A times zero	No	b	1
What does it mean	A would have to be one then right	sd	4
Cause I can tell you that a million to the zero power is one	Oh	b	1
Oh	So A times A times itself to	sd	4
Ten thousand to the zero power is one	What	ba	3
Start thinking about it	Cause these have to be A theyre A right	sd	5
Cause these have to be A theyre A right	Cause itll be one over	sd	5
Cause itll be one over	Itll just be	sd	1
Itll just be	The first one were having a hard time understanding	sd	3
Now think about what you can use over there between your multiplication and your division rules and prove to me that A to the zero is one	Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	sd	1
Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	Well what did what did you do	sd	1
Lets see	We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	sd	5
We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	Cause then	sd	1
Using your rules up there	Oh okay	b	1
How am I gonna get that zero power and itll start making sense to you	Okay	b	1
Okay	Cause he kept saying this is impossible cause wouldnt it be zero equals A	sd	2
And how did you do that	I multiplied two by itself	sd	4
So here this is not saying A times zero this is say A to the zero power	Told you	aa	1
A to the zero power	That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	sd	5
That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	So that would be one right	sd	5
What if A was equal to 1000	Then itd be A to I dont know	sd	4
No cause a thousand to the zero power is	Is	b	1
What can I do mathematically to get A to zero power	Mathematically A to the zero power	sd	4
Mhhm	Oh you plus plus N	sd	4
Oh you plus plus N	Can we use the calculator	sd	1
Yeah you could use a calculator	Okay	b	1
You could use a calculator	Okay	b	1
Okay	So so the second	sd	1
Put in 1000 to the zero power	Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	sd	5
Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	So it would be one right	sd	4
So it would be one right	Or you just get it	sd	1
Or you just get it	How do you get zero equals one	sd	3
Okay	Okay I dont get it	sd	3
Okay	Maybe you divide it by one or something so that would be	sv	4
Look at your rules of exponents up there and where do you think you can get a negative N	Oh A times M over A times N equals A M minus N	sd	4
So therefore M would have to be larger than N Right	Yeah	b	1
Think about it	We dont understand this	sd	3
Now Ryan I figured youd have this solved in no time	I I I cant work with them	sd	1
I I I cant work with them	Work with us	sd	1
Work with us	Its weird	sd	1
Its weird	We dont under	sd	1
We dont under	I remember learning this a long time ago	sd	1
I remember learning this a long time ago	Like it was one of those questions	sd	1
Like it was one of those questions	It was like one of those brain stumpers	sd	1
It was like one of those brain stumpers	Yeah	b	1
Right	And we can divide	sd	4
And we can divide	Yeah	b	2
What kind of problem could you give me	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	A multiplication problem	sd	4
With exponents	With exponents	sd	1
With exponents	With exponents	sd	1
With exponents	A to the one	sd	4
A to the one	Yeah	b	2
A to the one and then what would I have to do to A to the one so that it becomes A to the zero	Divide it	sd	4
Divide it	Minus it	sd	2
By one or by	Zero	sd	4
Now since were doing division what does the rules of exponents say	Oh you have to minus right	sd	4
So it says that what youre going to do to get this and we want this put this equal A to the zero	To equal	aa	4
What whats whats one of the rules	You have to minus minus	sd	4
You have to minus minus	You subtract the	sd	2
You subtract the top exponent from the bottom	Yes	b	1
So how am I going to what am I gonna put down here such that this would be zero when Im done	One A	sd	4
One A	A to the one	sd	2
A to the one	Okay	b	4
Now is A to the one over A to the one equal to A to the zero	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
By your rules what do you do	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You subtract	sd	4
You subtract	Cause you subtract	sd	2
Now what do you know about math when a number is over itself	They cancel out	sd	4
And what does it equal	Zero	sd	4
And whats that equal to	Zero	sd	4
What does that say	A to the zero	sd	4
Now didnt you just prove it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So how do you write that out	sd	3
So how do you write that out	Oh	b	1
Oh	I	b	1
I	Can we just show that	sd	1
Can we just show that	All right	aa	1
All right	Thats it	ba	1
Thats it	Thats real easy	sd	1
Okay	All right	aa	1
All right	Okay	b	1
Now was it as hard as you thought	Yep	b	1
Yep	Sure	b	1
Okay	Do we have homework tonight	sd	1
You have homework tonight	Oh	b	1
See ya	The first one	sd	1
The first one	Bye Mrs Scott	sd	1
Bye Mrs Scott	I love you	sd	1
I love you	Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	sd	1
Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	We think youre the bomb	sv	1
Let s hear what he has to say  alright so we had one argument to choose but we have Alan and he  has a different one	Okay I used the dark green and um and I used the light greens for the  halves and the red rods for the thirds and then I took the white rods  and put them up against the reds	sd	5
Okay I used the dark green and um and I used the light greens for the  halves and the red rods for the thirds and then I took the white rods  and put them up against the reds	And those would be the halves	sd	5
And those would be the halves	So I took  that out because that would be a half and that would be a third and  one of these would be one sixth so I put that up to here and it took  one sixth to complete so it s the half is bigger than a third by one  sixth	sd	5
Do you agree Jessica	No	b	2
Jessica doesn t agree	I think he s like remember you said that it can be only be one size  candy bar and that s like a whole different size candy bar he s  making	sd	5
Now hold on Alan uh ok Jessica disagrees	Well me and Jacqueline agree	sd	2
Why do you agree	Well because when you go to the store there s not just one size  candy bar there s all different kinds of sizes so you can make a  model with a different size	sd	5
Ok  Michael	I agree with it because um it can be done because there s like six  whites equal up to one green and then it takes one white plus a red to  equal a light green which is half so that would be one sixth	sd	5
I agree with it because um it can be done because there s like six  whites equal up to one green and then it takes one white plus a red to  equal a light green which is half so that would be one sixth	Yeah but it s I think it still could be one sixth but it s just a  different size candy bar	sd	5
Yeah but it s I think it still could be one sixth but it s just a  different size candy bar	Yeah I know we said any one sixth is right	sd	2
What do you think Jessica was  confused about then	Yeah the sixth isn t the same size	sd	4
This is a model where um	Yeah because the whole is not the same size	sd	5
Jessica	But because say if you wanted to give someone one sixth of that  candy bar and then you were going to give someone one sixth of the  other one then the person with that size would get a smaller amount	sd	5
What do you think	Well um that s right because if um it s just a different size candy  bar	sd	5
Well um that s right because if um it s just a different size candy  bar	If you just gave half of that to the person and the other half of  that to another person you would still have the same size	sd	5
If you just gave half of that to the person and the other half of  that to another person you would still have the same size	You can t  switch the candy bars	sd	5
In this problem	Well they didn t switch a candy bar in that problem but from the  problem that Jessica that Jessica did he switched the candy bar  they switched the candy bar from the orange and the red to the dark  green and if you re giving someone half of the orange and red and  someone else half of the dark green the person getting half of the  orange and the red is getting a bigger piece	sd	5
That s true but are we doing that	No	b	1
Michael	What Jessica was confused about is she didn t think it would be  right because they you had a different size one sixth but he also  switched the whole so the whole is smaller by one white	sd	5
Andrew	The white	sd	4
One  was Beth	Orange and red	sd	4
Beth	Twelve I mean wait	sd	4
So you all agree with that	So when I take off these I think that itll fall over here	sd	5
So when I take off these I think that itll fall over here	And  the green is the whole thing and the light green is a half and  the reds are a third	sd	5
Because Dr Martino didn t see  this and I think she ll want to see it	Well she s making something else and I m making I made  the balance	sd	2
Well she s making something else and I m making I made  the balance	She s making another	sd	2
Dr Martino if we can get her here	All right I made a balance and the whole thing is dark green  and the light green is a half and the reds are the thirds but  then what I m doing is um I m making a balance so when I  take off that and those two reds then I  think it will fall to this side and show that the half is bigger	sd	5
All right I made a balance and the whole thing is dark green  and the light green is a half and the reds are the thirds but  then what I m doing is um I m making a balance so when I  take off that and those two reds then I  think it will fall to this side and show that the half is bigger	When he removes the one light green rod  and the two red   leaving one light green rod and one  red rod his structure falls to the side of the light  green rod	sd	1
What  did you take off	I took off the two reds and a light green	sd	4
It it you  said it fell to the right the way you had it built okay	Um	b	1
Is that correct and the  greens were on the other side or was it the other way	Well the reds were on the left side	sd	4
So you took the two reds from the left side  and the green from the right	Mmmm hmm	sd	1
Do you understand my question	Um let s see	sd	1
What would you have guessed it should have been	Um maybe a little white  these	sd	4
Why  were you looking for that one	Well  cause when I went like this I just saw there was one space in between and I  knew the white is that space	sd	5
That s  the next question	Um	b	1
TRUE or false or open	Open	b	4
Open	Open	b	2
Hum could you tell me something that I could write in the box that would make a false statement Brian	Uh five	sd	4
Yes	Uh hum	b	1
Where do you want me to write the six	Put six plus six equals eight	sd	5
Okay was that legal	No	sd	1
No	Yes it was legal	sd	4
Yes it was legal	Yes it was	sd	2
Yes it was	But it was a false statement	sd	2
Six plus six equals eight true or false	False	aa	4
Michael	Six and two	sd	4
Okay is that legal or illegal	Illegal	sd	4
Illegal	Illegal	sd	2
Illegal	Illegal because he didn t put the same number in both boxes	sd	5
Illegal because he didn t put the same number in both boxes	What does that say	sd	1
Bobby	Six plus eight	sd	4
Eight	Eight	sd	4
How about that	It could be better	sd	4
He did what he wanted it to do and it is illegal because he doesn t have the same thing in both boxes	I like fifty	sd	4
And the statement six plus eight equals eight	That was really good	sd	1
Is certainly false	I have to think of these	sd	1
Okay somebody ask the next question	Someone ask the next question	sd	1
Yeah	Can you like take a legal substitution and have a true answer	sd	1
Yeah can you make a legal substitution and get a true statement	Four and Four	sd	4
Four and Four	Way to go Ankur	sd	1
It is saying to put four in all of the boxes and it will be true	Yes	b	1
Think  about it for a minute and you want to talk to you partner	Youre using all the yellows	sd	1
Youre using all the yellows	I have them	sd	1
I have them	I only have two	sd	1
I only have two	She called orange two	sd	1
She called orange two	One half	sd	4
One half	Two	sd	4
Two	Then this would  have to be one	sd	4
You can come up here  and show us	You would put two yellows together and it would be the same  size as that and even if and thats like having so if this is considered a two	sd	5
You would put two yellows together and it would be the same  size as that and even if and thats like having so if this is considered a two	Then those two would  be considered like a regular orange so it would be considered a  one	sd	5
Okay so youd consider each of these a one is  that what youre saying	No that like together they would equal the same as that  so it would be a one	sd	5
So the number name youre giving yellow then was what	One one	sd	4
I  heard I heard some	I have another name	sd	1
I have another name	You can call it another name	sd	4
Okay what would you call it Erik	Well see do you have to call the orange two	sd	1
Well Ive arbitrarily picked that Im calling the orange two	Well you could call it one and if you call it one then two  yellows would be a half	sd	5
Well you could call it one and if you call it one then two  yellows would be a half	If that would be considered if the  orange would be considered two then youd call those one	sd	5
If that would be considered if the  orange would be considered two then youd call those one	But if you can call it one you could call  those halves	sd	5
Thats interesting what if I call the orange  uh	There might be other ways	sd	4
There might be other ways	You can split them  you can maybe split it into thirds and call that a one but we  dont have enough thirds	sd	5
Can you come up and tell us about  that	Look here before you said that would equal two and then Brian said that would equal once	sd	2
Look here before you said that would equal two and then Brian said that would equal once	So now youre saying that that equals six so I figured that if that equaled one before it would equal five now	sd	5
Uh lets see	You said that the orange was six	sd	2
You said that the orange was six	And  before you said that this was two and this was one	sd	2
And  before you said that this was two and this was one	So now if youre calling six and have of six would  be three	sd	5
So now if youre calling six and have of six would  be three	So thats	ba	1
Meredith	Yeah	b	1
You agree with that	I agree with him because like half of six is three so that would	sd	5
Can you help me  understand why you think five	Well before you said that was two the orange was two and the  yellow was one	sd	2
Well before you said that was two the orange was two and the  yellow was one	So now youre saying its six so the yellow  could be five	sd	5
Youre saying  if this is five and this  is five this is six	Okay I made a mistake I	sd	4
You didnt mean that	Well I made the mistake	sd	4
Well I made the mistake	I figured it out now	sd	1
Thats what I want to know	I made the mistake thinking from before I forgot that adding  one and one is two but five and five isnt six so I made that  mistake	sd	5
If you want this to be five what would you have to call the  orange	Ten	sd	4
but remember that whatever   number you put in the first box what do you have to do	Put it in the rest of them	sd	1
Good	Oh I got it	sd	1
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	sd	1
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	sd	1
What	Six times six	sd	4
Okay hum let s get the paper passed out and let s try that	That s not true	sd	2
That s not true	Yes it is	sd	2
Yes it is	Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is   thirty	sd	5
Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is   thirty	No it s impossible that s wrong	sd	2
No it s impossible that s wrong	Yeah that s right	aa	2
Yeah that s right	That s one of the ways	sd	4
That s one of the ways	I told you	aa	1
I told you	Oh shut up	aa	1
Oh shut up	It doesn t work	sd	2
It doesn t work	Why don t you pass the paper down	sd	1
Does work or   doesn t work	Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	sd	4
Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	There are two different numbers Jeff	sd	2
There are two different numbers Jeff	Two different   numbers	sd	2
Six doesn t work okay	No two	sd	4
No two	A couple different can go	sd	4
A couple different can go	No	sd	2
No	No	b	2
No	Doesn t it have to be all one number have to be in   every box	sd	4
Yes the same number has to be	But there is two different possible answers though	sd	4
But there is two different possible answers though	I think I got it	sd	1
I think I got it	I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I   got it	sd	1
Michelle	Yeah	b	1
Everybody agrees with that	Oh I  don t want it to be right	sd	2
Matt can you show  that	I have a different number	sd	2
I have a different number	I think it might work with three	sv	4
Yeah okay and	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Two and three work that works	sd	4
How much is that	Negative six	sd	4
How much is that	Plus the six would be zero	sd	4
Plus the six would be zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thank You	aa	1
And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	True	aa	4
True	That was three	sd	4
Do I put the two  here or here	No three wouldn t work	sd	4
No three wouldn t work	In the brackets	sd	4
It goes in the truth set that makes it true	Let s try three now	sd	4
Let s try three now	Three	sd	2
Now various people are saying three	Three is not going to work	sd	2
You say three you say three  it works	It is	aa	1
It is	It works	aa	4
It works	Three is going to work	sd	2
Three is going to work	I m just thinking don t	sd	1
I m just thinking don t	No	b	1
No	It works	aa	4
It works	It works	aa	2
So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that	Negative six	sd	4
how much is that	Zero	sd	4
Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false	It s true	aa	4
Okay well I ve got some of these that I made up that I am  wondering if I can get any of them cause they re so hard  that none of you can do them	How about if we make something and have it like be  impossible	sd	3
Not even Michelle not anybody not Ankur not Milin not anybody	Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus  fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	sd	1
Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus  fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	If it s impossible forget it	sd	1

How will you do for one twentyfive	The Odd rule	sd	4
Yeah	I will go to one twentyfour which is   I got a one twentyfourrrrr  wait wait what am I doing it is seventytwo I believe no no don t think that  sixty two   hah hah hah	sd	4
I will go to one twentyfour which is   I got a one twentyfourrrrr  wait wait what am I doing it is seventytwo I believe no no don t think that  sixty two   hah hah hah	I m smart	sd	1
I m smart	Yeah sixtytwo	b	4
How many you got	It is sixtytwo half of one twentyfour	sd	4
For one twenty five	I have to figure that out	sd	1
Yeah can you figure that out	I doubt it	sd	1
I doubt it	Let me see if this is	sd	1
The rule is here	My rule uh my perfet rule I have to set it up for this huge thing	sd	1
One twentyfour steps	No this is two right here	sd	4
No this is two right here	One two three four five six seven eight	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight	For sixty it is one hundred and ninetyeight add two it is two hundred	sd	5
For sixty it is one hundred and ninetyeight add two it is two hundred	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	No we add six oh	sd	4
No we add six oh	One two three four five six seven eight	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	One hundred ninetyeight	sd	1
One hundred ninetyeight	One ninetynine two hundred twootwo twoothree twoofour and twoosix	sd	1
One ninetynine two hundred twootwo twoothree twoofour and twoosix	Two hundred and six rods	sd	4
You do a lot in your head I just cannot follow you	One twenty five rounded to the nearest even number it could be one twenty four or one twenty six I did one twentyfour	sd	5
OK	Then one twenty four divided by two is sixty two	sd	5
How did you find out OK	Sixty is	sd	5
Sixty is	I went back to my recent observations sixty is one hundred ninety eight and then I made these two steps which gave me eight more rods which makes it one hundred   two hundred and six rods	sd	5
I went back to my recent observations sixty is one hundred ninety eight and then I made these two steps which gave me eight more rods which makes it one hundred   two hundred and six rods	Now we shall multiply	sd	5
Now we shall multiply	Fourten	sd	5
They were ready	The 1 and 2 that equals the 3	sd	5
The 1 and 2 that equals the 3	And then 2 and 4 thats 6 and then he did 3 cream and 6 chocolate thats already 9 but since he kept going 4 cream and 8 chocolates it equals the 12 and its supposed to be only 9 cups of ingredients	sd	5
And then 2 and 4 thats 6 and then he did 3 cream and 6 chocolate thats already 9 but since he kept going 4 cream and 8 chocolates it equals the 12 and its supposed to be only 9 cups of ingredients	And you	sd	1
And you	I dont really get this one	sd	3
I dont really get this one	Its kind of like what I did	sd	1
Its kind of like what I did	Um	b	1
Um	For every 1 cup of cream he did 2 cups of chocolate and he did it again 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate and that would equal to um 2 cups of cream 4 cups of chocolate	sd	5
For every 1 cup of cream he did 2 cups of chocolate and he did it again 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate and that would equal to um 2 cups of cream 4 cups of chocolate	And then he kept doing that but then he kept going	sd	5
And then he kept doing that but then he kept going	So at the end he did it wrong	sd	2
So at the end he did it wrong	Because he should have stopped when he had 3 cream and 6 cups of chocolate	sd	5
Because he should have stopped when he had 3 cream and 6 cups of chocolate	Oh	b	1
Oh	Because if he kept going on he would have 12 and its not 9	sd	5
What do you think	The answer is logical	sd	1
The answer is logical	On the chart it says 8 cups of chocolate with the 4 cups of cream but if you add them together it makes 12 cups in total	sd	5
On the chart it says 8 cups of chocolate with the 4 cups of cream but if you add them together it makes 12 cups in total	But the problem says Anthony made 9 cups in total for the ingredients	sd	5
What do you think Saurabh	He was heading in the right direction but then he went up to 4 which was wrong because he should have reached up to 3 because theres 9 cups in total and	sd	5
So youre saying this student should have stopped here	Yeah	b	1
Did you have something to say	I think he wrote 8 cups because he misinterpreted the sentence	sd	5
I think he wrote 8 cups because he misinterpreted the sentence	He thought that you have to use 9 cups of the 2 of chocolate only in the ingredients so he got 8 cups which is the closest	sd	5
He thought that you have to use 9 cups of the 2 of chocolate only in the ingredients so he got 8 cups which is the closest	But then and he didnt want to go over the limit so he just wrote 8	sd	5
What did you want to add Timothy	I disagree with Jake because if he thought that only 1 cup would go for 1 cup of cream would go for every 1 cup of cream would go in the whole recipe then he wouldnt have had 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate 2 cups of cream and 4 he would have just had 1 cup of cream and 2 of chocolate 1 cup of cream and 4 of chocolate	sd	5
I disagree with Jake because if he thought that only 1 cup would go for 1 cup of cream would go for every 1 cup of cream would go in the whole recipe then he wouldnt have had 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate 2 cups of cream and 4 he would have just had 1 cup of cream and 2 of chocolate 1 cup of cream and 4 of chocolate	If he thought that 1 cup only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	sd	5
You said it would go 1 and 4	If he thought only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	sd	2
Okay	Then he wouldnt have had 2 cups of cream for 4 cups of chocolate	sd	2
Okay so youre saying this 1 because they had the solution of 8 cups that they were only counting 1 cup of cream in the whole recipe	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	But if they had it up to the 4 that doesnt make sense that theres only 1	sd	2
Did you want to respond	I dont think that Tim understanded me because I mean like he thought that all the ingredients combined is 9 cups he thought it was just the chocolate that needed 9 cups	sd	5
Lets go to Nathan	We came up with a diagram with a bunch of numbers and equations on it	sd	4
Lets go to Julian	We also said diagram but like pictures on it	sd	4
All right so  Kelsey	Figure	aa	4
Lets go Keilty	A graph	sd	4
And lets go here Danny	A chart	sd	4
Go ahead	Put it here	sd	1
Yes Alan	On the number line I used one as the half mark between zero and two and	sd	4
So you thought of number  one as being half way	Umhum	sd	1
And where would you  place four	Hum I would probably put it there	sd	4
Okay get the idea	Umhum	sd	1
Do you know where you would place a million	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Down the hall	sd	1
Amy what do you think	Because you can have negative	sd	5
Okay so where do you think I would put negative one	Negative one	sd	1
Negative one	Oh I know	aa	1
You all watch and see if this makes sense	Like right there	sd	4
So can we talk about why we would put it there	Well because its not exactly but that	sd	5
Im guessing where would you put a negative two	Negative two would be about there	sd	4
Kimberly what do you think	I think it is negative one back there because it is beyond zero	sv	5
Its beyond zero	Yeah	b	1
Which way beyond zero	That way	aa	4
To the left of zero	To the left of zero	sd	1
And the positive one	Its beyond zero	sd	4
Which way	This way	aa	4
To the right	Yeah	b	1
Alan	I think that all numbers to the left of zero would be in the negative and all numbers to the  right of zero would be in the positive	sd	4
Can  you read it	Integers	sd	1
Can you say it	Integers	sd	1
So now you know about the set of integers which you usually  study when you get to prealgebra or algebra	Thats what my brothers in	sd	1
Okay	Ohm no	b	1
If I said you know make me a number  line with the integers would you know how to do that	Ohmhum	aa	1
Can you show me how that works	Well I dont want it to go on forever	sd	1
Well I dont want it to go on forever	What do you want us to go on to	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Alana	A chart	sd	4
Noah	See how many blues and greens and clears	sd	4
I want you to make a tally chart with your table about how many blue you have altogether how many green how many clear how many red how many yellow altogether	Six blues and two greens	sd	4
Six blues and two greens	One two three four one	sd	1
One two three four one	And we did eight nine ten eleven	sd	1
And we did eight nine ten eleven	You got yellow	sd	1
Okay so you already added them up	Nine blues nine blues	sd	4
Nine blues nine blues	We have ten of these	sd	4
We have ten of these	Ten green	sd	4
Ten green	One two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	1
Okay we re going to total each one so I m going to need each group to be ready okay	One one one	sd	4
One green	Nine	sd	4
Nine	I say 15	sd	2
I say 15	Whoa man	sd	1
Ethan what was your clear	Six eleven	sd	4
Let s review together what does a bar graph look like	Number down the side and number or colors	sd	4
I want you to make a bar graph with your group displaying this information	So go from right one two three four five right align it	sd	5
So go from right one two three four five right align it	Let s see boy 5 10 15 20 25 30	sd	5
Let s see boy 5 10 15 20 25 30	And it went all the way up to 50	sd	5
And it went all the way up to 50	We are counting blue all the way up to 40 because counting by 2 s up to 50	sd	5
We are counting blue all the way up to 40 because counting by 2 s up to 50	And then we re coloring in up to the number that s on the board	sd	5
Had lots of different discussion about how the scale should be set up	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	It s about 40	sd	4
It s about 40	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	That s good	ba	2
This is where we analyze out data and figure out why we found mostly green and yellow and   I like this lesson because the students are generating their own ideas	A clear one could be an animal that  camouflages	sd	4
What about blue ribbon	2 meters	sd	4
2 meters	1 meter	sd	4
Ok let s see what Andrew has to say	By the number one it says white ribbon it has one meter  and one meter on the bottom where it says	sd	5
By the number one it says white ribbon it has one meter  and one meter on the bottom where it says	And then it says  make a ribbon length of bows and number of bows	sd	5
And then it says  make a ribbon length of bows and number of bows	So you  have to find out look under the ribbon length of bow so it  will be one meter and one half how many bows can you get  out of one half a meter	sd	5
So you  have to find out look under the ribbon length of bow so it  will be one meter and one half how many bows can you get  out of one half a meter	So you would have to figure out  that	sd	5
What does it say on the chart	You have to use ribbon length of the bow	sd	4
You have to use ribbon length of the bow	You have to use  one half of a meter	sd	4
Ok	One ribbon is a half a meter	sd	4
One ribbon is a half a meter	And then you have to figure out how many bows how  many of those bows you make	sd	4
From one meter ribbon and each bow is a half  meter in length	And how many bows of that kind	sd	4
How  long is that one	The blue ribbon is about 2 meters	sd	4
How long is the white one supposed to be	One meter	sd	4
Is that one meter	I don t know	sd	1
Do you know how big a meter is supposed to be	Three feet	sd	4
It s near 3 feet but feet and  meters are different	You know how they are different	sd	4
What are you trying to figure out guys	We re trying to figure out the second problem in number  one	sd	1
We re trying to figure out the second problem in number  one	One meter is three thirds	sd	5
One meter is three thirds	So we have to find three  thirds of this one meter ribbon and then we ll know how  much bows we can make	sd	5
So we have to find three  thirds of this one meter ribbon and then we ll know how  much bows we can make	I think I know already	sd	1
What do you think you know	I think its three because when you divide thirds up it s one third twothirds threethirds	sd	5
I think its three because when you divide thirds up it s one third twothirds threethirds	So it would be like one  ribbon one ribbon one ribbon	sd	5
So it would be like one  ribbon one ribbon one ribbon	so divide it into thirds but we need to  make sure	sd	5
What do you think of what Andrew said	Yeah I agree with that but we re just making sure	sd	2
Ok you think it makes sense but you re just kind of  checking it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I know that fourths is 25	sd	4
I know that fourths is 25	It would be right here	sd	4
It would be right here	I think I got 30 and a half	sd	4
I think I got 30 and a half	According to him 30 and a half	sd	2
According to him 30 and a half	30 60 61  plus 30 is only 91 and a half	sd	5
30 60 61  plus 30 is only 91 and a half	What did you get	qy	3
What did you get	30 and a  half	sd	1
30 and a  half	I think its 32	sv	4
I think its 32	32 and 32 is 64	sd	5
32 and 32 is 64	Then 32 is 90	sd	5
Then 32 is 90	32 and half	sd	2
32 and half	So there will be 65	sd	5
So there will be 65	32 and 65 is 97	sd	5
32 and 65 is 97		b	5
	33 66  99 8 and half	sd	5
33 66  99 8 and half	So it would be 100	sd	5
So it would be 100		b	5
What was the question	We want three bows	sd	4
What  was the number you came up with	James 33	sd	4
What was it	Centimeters	sd	4
Centimeters	Well Rutgers usually makes us prove what our answer is	sd	1
Well Rutgers usually makes us prove what our answer is	So we had to do three divided the ribbon into thirds first  third would be there second would be there and third	sd	5
So what was that though actuallythis 33 that you came up  with	One third	sd	4
One third	One third yeah one third of a	sd	2
One third yeah one third of a	That s sixty fi sixty	sd	4
That 33what was it	That was like in centimeters	sd	4
Well what is that	We re proving	sd	1
We re proving	We are proving that we wanted to make  sure that when you divide it into thirds there s no left over  or anything so we can actually	sd	5
You can do anyone you want	I m doing this one	sd	1
I m doing this one	Three meters and I used this	sd	4
Three meters and I used this	I got 39  plus 39 plus 39 and	sd	4
Is that exact	Two meters	sd	4
Is it exactly 114 inches	Would this be 4	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Do you buy that	Uh well which one is she doing	sd	1
Blue ribbon the first one		b	4
	Yeah 4	b	4
Do you see why	Oh yeah I know why	aa	1
Oh yeah I know why	I think I know why	sd	1
Yeah why	Well one meter is say approximately three feet without any  inches	sd	5
Well one meter is say approximately three feet without any  inches	Say it was just plain 3 feet then and if there was  two meters would be two meters would be approximately  about 12 feet no 6 feet 6 feet put together	sd	5
Approximately	Yeah approximately not exactly	sd	4
Yeah approximately not exactly	And if it was 6 feet and  each one was a half then it d be then half of three would  just be like saying one and a half another one and a half  and that ll fill up three	sd	5
And if it was 6 feet and  each one was a half then it d be then half of three would  just be like saying one and a half another one and a half  and that ll fill up three	Then for the other three one and a  half one and a half	sd	5
So how many is that all together		b	4
Is that the way you thought about  it	No	b	1
How did you do it	I just thought if it is two meters and each is a half two  halves are in a whole	sd	5
So two halves make a whole	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then there s 2 meters so I got 4	sd	5
Do you have to do that	No	b	1
Try it for the  gold ribbon	It would be six	sd	4
It would be six	No wait it d be eight	sd	4
No wait it d be eight	But it says there s two four six	sd	2
But it says there s two four six	Six meters	sd	4
Make sense	Six meters	sd	4
Six meters	What about the rest of it	sd	1
You re on a roll now	It d be twelve	sd	4
So is there is there a rule here	There s two in one meter which is approximately three  feet there are two halves	sd	5
There s two in one meter which is approximately three  feet there are two halves	In another one there are two  halves	sd	5
In another one there are two  halves	Another one there are two halves etc	sd	5
Another one there are two halves etc	And so if you  keep counting by two up to six meters that s be twelve  meters	sd	5
Ready to go on	This keeps  going	sd	4
It s one so it s one	One meter and it s two meters	sd	4
How do you know if it s true or not	Well it says two meters but do we have to get another one  of these	sd	1
Can you just use this one to measure	This you could	sv	1
Can you find some way to do that	Yes I think	sv	1
Ok let s put  together and then you try to stretch it	It s three	sd	4
It s three	We ll have to pretend that s  right	sd	1
We ll have to pretend that s  right	Ok so	aa	1
So the first questions is	One half of a meter	sd	4
One half of a meter	One half of one meter or two meters	sd	3
So now we use one half meter we can make how many  bows we can make	Two well would it be four	sd	4
Now we have two meters	Four yeah	aa	4
The reason being	Well you have to double that because now that there s  double that now it s two meters so	sv	5
And in two meters how many half meter we have	A half meter we have two	sd	4
In one meter how many half meters we have	Well we can make two we have one	sd	4
I said in one meter how many half meters we have	Is that like	aa	1
Half meter 50	One two one no that would be two	sd	4
Now we have two meters right	Yup	aa	1
The one we spent lots of time last time	Three meter	sd	4
Three meter	That would be I think that would be five	sv	4
Why five	Well because we just added one bow to that side oh no  now it d be six	sd	5
Ok so why s that	Because you re doubling you re doubling like last time  was three and three plus three is six	sd	5
Because you re doubling you re doubling like last time  was three and three plus three is six	And now I think that  would be 8 the next one	sd	5
And now I think that  would be 8 the next one	And that would be 10	sd	5
What about the last one	Oh they added one this time so	sd	5
If I fold it this like this and then I  measure it like this this is half of two meters right	That would be one meter	sd	4
But if I do this I make into three equal lengths then I  measure it what that would be	I think it d be a half	sd	4
I think it d be a half	Well it would be	sd	1
Right	Four	sd	4
Four	We need three right	sd	4
Right here we say twothirds	How would you make three	sd	3
How would you make three	That s four	ba	4
We have cut one meter into three equal lengths right	Put it up against this and see what it would come to	sd	1
Put it up against this and see what it would come to	Not  exactly	aa	4
Not  exactly	Thirtythree	sd	4
But then what I just  did a third	It would come to thirtythree	sd	4
So how can you get twothirds from  here	Well that came to  so then you get	sv	1
What is twothirds	Two one thirds	sd	4
Add them together	That would be um sixtysix	sd	4
Add two one	Sixtysix	sd	4
Sixtysix right	And that would equal up to here	sd	4
Convince me	It s double	sd	4
It s double	Its one half meter	sd	2
Its one half meter	This is two meters	sd	5
This is two meters	so one half of one meter would be two	sd	5
so one half of one meter would be two	And this is  two meters so another half of a meter would be plus the  other half would be four	sd	5
And this is  two meters so another half of a meter would be plus the  other half would be four	So that would explain why four  bows	sd	5
So that would explain why four  bows	Yeah what he s saying is you have this	sd	2
Yeah what he s saying is you have this	This acts as four	sd	4
Why acts as four	This	sd	1
Why does this act as four	Because this acts as two	sd	5
Because this acts as two	Well yeah this	b	2
Why does this act as two	Because we re saying this is a half	sd	5
Because we re saying this is a half	You cut this in half	sd	5
You cut this in half	You have two parts	sd	5
You have two parts	So you put that up to it  and it s two	sd	5
So you put that up to it  and it s two	And then you need   this is a  half of that	sv	5
And then you need   this is a  half of that	So you need one more and that s  four	sd	5
So you need one more and that s  four	So then this can act as three as cutting it into thirds	sd	5
So then this can act as three as cutting it into thirds	Is  putting sixthirds up to twothirds	sd	5
Is  putting sixthirds up to twothirds	But this two meters is  the whole so actually this	sd	5
But this two meters is  the whole so actually this	If two meters is the whole then  this is the half	sd	5
If two meters is the whole then  this is the half	This is almost like rods	sd	1
This is almost like rods	We don t have  every one though	sd	1
We don t have  every one though	This is the whole	sd	5
This is the whole	This is the half	sd	5
This is the half	We  have another one a half	sd	5
Um if  you have the blue ribbon and we want to figure out how  many bows we could make and each one is a half a meter  how did you figure out first you told me it was two and then  you said no it s four	It s four because	sd	4
It s four because	It could be either way	sd	2
Could it be either	I don t know	sd	1
I don t know	That one would be half of two meters	sd	4
That one would be half of two meters	So one half of two meters not one half of one meter	sd	2
And the question is how many bows can  you get out of that blue ribbon if each bow is gonna be a  half a meter long	Four cause this is going to be two meters long	sd	5
Four cause this is going to be two meters long	But its saying it s a half of two meters	sd	2
Let me see if I can understand what James is saying	But its saying it s a half of two meters because the blue  ribbon here is two meters is the whole so then this is half of  two meters that would only be two	sd	5
What is a half a  meter	One half of one of these	sd	4
One half of one of these	Yes four	sd	2
Yes four	That would be four and this would be	sd	4
That would be four and this would be	This would be two	sd	2
This would be two	One of these would go up against them	sd	5
One of these would go up against them	And that would be two halves and another one you put on  and that would be four	sd	5
If you took your  white ribbon and cut it in half how long would each bow  be	Each bow	b	1
How long is that white ribbon	100 meters so it would be 50	sd	4
100 meters so it would be 50	100 centimeters	sd	2
100 centimeters	Centimeters So it would be right	sd	2
Centimeters So it would be right	From there to there	sd	5
From there to there	Then you cut it in half it would be two	sd	5
If this is a meter how long would each  ribbon be	It would be 50 centimeters	sd	4
And in terms	These two are halves	sd	4
Halves of what	Of one meter	sd	4
Ok so now my  question	You can fit four of them in the blue	sd	4
How do you  know you can fit four of them in the blue	Well you can fit two of these in the blue	sd	5
Well you can fit two of these in the blue	Then you cut that  in half	sd	5
Then you cut that  in half	That s two	sd	5
That s two	So you have two in one	sd	5
So you have two in one	Then you have  the other side	sd	5
Then you have  the other side	That would be two and two is four	sd	5
Let s see if James agrees	Yeah I do agree	sd	2
You do agree	Yeah	b	2
What are you just doing now	I	b	1
What did you do	I put the   50 centimeters	sd	4
I put the   50 centimeters	Yeah so if you put that up to	sd	2
Can I hold the other side for  you so that it ll stay stretched out	Is the dot here yeah there s the crease	sd	4
You need another finger here	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So where the crease is is where it would be cut	sd	4
So where the crease is is where it would be cut	So  that s two	sd	4
Let s see	It s two	sd	4
Ok so out of this big blue ribbon we can make bows  that are a half a meter long and how many bows did you  get	And then with the third we were trying to figure out to be a  third of a bow	sd	4
Yeah	We thought it was sixty but	sd	4
Tell me why	Because there are three three	sd	5
You don t have to do it if you can  explain it to me	It would be three thirds in this so if you put three on one side	sd	5
It would be three thirds in this so if you put three on one side	and three on the other side	sd	5
Ok so you think you re gonna get six ribbons that  are a half of a meter  a third of a meter long from that big  blue ribbon	Yeah	b	1
T3 How about from the blue ribbon if you wanted to  make bows that are a quarter of a meter	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Eight	sd	2
Eight	Because maybe we can a half of the half is a fourth	sd	5
Because maybe we can a half of the half is a fourth	Since there s two halves it d be two four four on one side  four on the other so it would be eight	sd	5
Since there s two halves it d be two four four on one side  four on the other so it would be eight	It would be eight	sd	2
Ok you re both agreeing on that	Yes	b	2
Yes	The same for fifths	sd	4
What would be for fifths	It would be	sd	1
It would be	ten	sd	5
ten	Because it would be five on one side  and five on the other	sd	5
Now you want to cut  bows that are two thirds meters long	That s where we were	sd	1
That s where you were left	Ok alright let s try this again	sd	1
Ok alright let s try this again	Put that over there	sd	1
You re gonna hold it for him	I ll hold it right here	aa	1
I ll hold it right here	We were thinking it has to be somewhere between 71 and  60	sd	5
We were thinking it has to be somewhere between 71 and  60	Because we tried 60 and we tried 71 and 71 was over  and 60 was less so we came down and we were trying 69	sd	5
Because we tried 60 and we tried 71 and 71 was over  and 60 was less so we came down and we were trying 69	So it would be 69	sd	5
So it would be 69	And then 138	sd	2
And then 138	138 and 69 is	sd	4
138 and 69 is	It s over	sd	4
It s over	So we ll try 68	sd	4
So we ll try 68	68 and 68 is 136	sd	5
68 and 68 is 136	68 is over	sd	4
68 is over	So it s  about 105	sd	5
You are working with these numbers I didn t  hear you working with the numbers before	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	That s because the thirds We didn t actually find the  thirds yet	sd	5
That s because the thirds We didn t actually find the  thirds yet	And this is saying two thirds	sd	5
And this is saying two thirds	So it s kind of  harder	sd	1
So it s kind of  harder	Because the length of the third is 33	sd	5
Because the length of the third is 33	It would be  36	sd	5
It would be  36	I mean 66	sd	4
I mean 66		b	4
		b	2
	Yeah 32	b	2
Yeah 32	Only 98	sd	4
Only 98		b	4
		b	4
	66 and a half	sd	2
66 and a half	66 and half	sd	2
66 and half		b	4
		b	2
	Yeah 33	b	2
Yeah 33		b	4
	Yeah	b	2
Confused again	It s 199 not 200	sd	4
It s 199 not 200	We want it to be 200 right	sd	1
We want it to be 200 right	Yeah but this is 200	sd	2
Yeah but this is 200	We re talking about	sd	1
We re talking about	We counted this  and then 120 120 133 plus 60 is 290	sd	5
We counted this  and then 120 120 133 plus 60 is 290	66 and a half and 33 and that makes 99 and a half	sd	5
66 and a half and 33 and that makes 99 and a half	199 and a half	sd	2
199 and a half	Hold on let me try 67 67 134 yeah	sd	4
Hold on let me try 67 67 134 yeah	Yeah 134	b	2
Yeah 134	That s 67	ba	4
That s 67	It s one over	sd	4
What are you trying to figure out	We re trying to figure out a third of blue	sd	4
Tell me what kind of ribbon are you trying to cut  now from this big blue ribbon	We re trying to cut	sd	4
How long is going to be the ribbon you re going to  be cutting	Two thirds of one meter	sd	4
Ok and want do we want to find out	If it s two thirds of one meter that would be that would be	sv	1
Just tell me what the question is so I know that you  know what you re working on	It s two thirds of one meter	sd	4
What s two thirds of a meter	So it s two meters and two thirds of a meter the number of  bows	sd	4
James what are you trying to find out	I think it s four	sv	4
But what s the question just so  I know you know what you re working on	It s how many	sd	1
It s how many	Two thirds	sd	4
Two thirds	How many two thirds lengths bows can you make of two  meters	sd	3
Ok so how many bows are you going to cut from  this blue ribbon if each bow is going to be how big	Two thirds	sd	4
Two thirds of a meter right	Yeah	b	1
Ok	So one third is 33	sd	4
So one third is 33		b	4
	33 66 so that s two	sd	5
33 66 so that s two	Three you actually have two meters  left over I mean two thirds left over	sd	5
What do you mean you have two thirds leftover	Because if you want to make take two thirds and there s  three thirds so take two thirds plus two thirds plus one third  and one third you have two more thirds	sd	5
Say it again	There s three thirds so there s two  thirds and one third and one third that s two thirds and you  still have one two thirds left over	sd	5
This is real interesting	So then there s one third and two  thirds is two thirds so then here s the half	sd	5
So then there s one third and two  thirds is two thirds so then here s the half	So you only have one third so then you have to get  the other third	sd	5
So you only have one third so then you have to get  the other third	This is two  thirds so then you have two more thirds left over	sd	5
What did he just say	He s saying that there s six meters	sd	2
He s saying that there s six meters	There are two meters	sd	2
This blue ribbon is two meters uh huh	Yeah And there are six meters is in  each and it would be two thirds is one two thirds is again  and two thirds left	sd	5
Can you picture that white  ribbon over there if we took it and divided it into thirds	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then it would be you divide this	sd	5
And then it would be you divide this	This one and this one  around here would be a half	sd	5
This one and this one  around here would be a half	Like right there would be half  because this is the whole now	sd	5
Like right there would be half  because this is the whole now	So then it would be one  third two thirds three thirds	sd	5
Which ribbon am I looking at	The white	sd	4
The white	This whole thing is the blue ribbon and this is the white	sd	2
What did you divide it into  over here	Thirds	sd	4
Thirds ok	It would be a third of 33 66 99	sd	4
You just divided it into thirds and what did you end  up with over here	Two  I ended up with um two thirds	sd	5
Two  I ended up with um two thirds	That would be that  would be one and one third but you had two thirds left over	sd	5
Ok you re saying that if you take that white ribbon  and divide it up into thirds how many thirds would you get  if you took that white ribbon and divided it into thirds	Three	sd	4
What do you think James	Yeah three	aa	2
And what about from your finger  over to here if you took this white ribbon and divided it up	Three	sd	4
Ok now but what Andrew was saying which I think  is real interesting is  you re trying to make your bows that  are how long	Two thirds of a meter	sd	4
How  how many ribbons could you make from  this	I have to go	sd	1
You think you could only get two bows that are two  thirds	No three	sd	2
No three	I think three	sv	2
I think three	Why three if you have two thirds and two thirds	sd	3
Why three if you have two thirds and two thirds	You have two third and two thirds and  then there are six and this is two thirds and this is two thirds  would be one two three yeah four	sd	5
You have two third and two thirds and  then there are six and this is two thirds and this is two thirds  would be one two three yeah four	One two no three  one	sd	5
One two no three  one	I know but two thirds	sd	2
I know but two thirds	Andrew I know but half is	sd	2
Andrew I know but half is	So two thirds of this two thirds of the white then you have  two thirds of the white ribbon then two thirds of the white  ribbon right	sd	5
So two thirds of this two thirds of the white then you have  two thirds of the white ribbon then two thirds of the white  ribbon right	And there if you have one more third and one  more third of the white and there if you have one more third  and one more third of the white and then you have two  thirds left over going that way or going that way	sd	5
From this blue ribbon	Yeah	b	1
And then tell  us how you think you can you convince us that your  solution is correct	Well you re supposed to like  there s one meter of white  ribbon and then you have to split it into um a half so I got  um two bows	sd	5
Caitlin	Three	sd	4
Can you prove it	Well we have one meter so you take one and there s two in  one	sd	5
I see that how did you do that	Then it s one third so you divide it into thirds and you  would get three	sd	5
Kimberly	She folded it three times	sd	2
It s three  pieces right	Two but it came out	sd	2
And Jackie	We did it at first then we forgot how we did it	sd	1
Class	Three	sd	4
How many times did you fold it Danielle	Twice	sd	4
Kelly what do you think	We can measure it	sd	4
Graham	Well you could take four of these and put them up together on a meter stick and see  if they fit together	sd	4
Caitlin	I think that each time it goes up one	sd	5
I think that each time it goes up one	Like one two it went  up one for one meter	sd	5
Like one two it went  up one for one meter	Then so two would be three and three  would be four and four would be five	sd	5
What do you think Brian	How I got them was I divided all of them by one	sd	5
How I got them was I divided all of them by one	And I got  mostly when it said one third I got three bows	sd	5
You re telling me if you  have one meter and if you re dividing it by one half what  did you get	I d get two bows	sd	4
If you had one  meter length and divided it by one third what did you get	Three bows	sd	4
And what was the next one class	One fourth	sd	4
What do you think Kelly	There s a pattern	sd	4
What do you mean	Well each time you have one that like one half came out to  two then one third came out to three one fourth came  out  came out to four and one fifth came out to five so  there s like a pattern because with the ones and so you like  you look over here and you could see because the one and  the two you could really see that it comes out to two bows	sd	5
Graham	Maybe ten	sd	4
Kimberly	I think that it would be ten but they would be very very  tiny	sd	4
Andrew	Well I think if you re making one half of a meter and two  meters there would be four bows	sd	5
How can you convince me that that s true	Well the reason why it would be four bows is because it  says one half of one meter and there s two meters and so  you have the blue rod and you take see you put a white rod  up to it I mean ribbon and you put two you put one white  ribbon up to it and it equals one half	sd	5
Well the reason why it would be four bows is because it  says one half of one meter and there s two meters and so  you have the blue rod and you take see you put a white rod  up to it I mean ribbon and you put two you put one white  ribbon up to it and it equals one half	And then another one and it equals  the other half so two whites go into a blue	sd	5
And then another one and it equals  the other half so two whites go into a blue	So then since  this is one meter and it s asking one half of one meter and  so you have a half of it is two on one half of the blue and  then two on the other half side of the blue so that s four  bows	sd	5
How did you get six	Well there s two meters and in one meter there are three  thirds and in the other meter there are three thirds	sd	5
Well there s two meters and in one meter there are three  thirds and in the other meter there are three thirds	In the  other meter there are three thirds	sd	5
In the  other meter there are three thirds	So you add them	sd	5
So you add them	In one  meter there are three third and the other meter there are  three thirds	sd	5
In one  meter there are three third and the other meter there are  three thirds	If you add the two meters together it d be three  thirds and three thirds which is six	sd	5
Andrew it sounded very much like  the way you did the other one	Yeah	b	1
Good for you  Brian	I did the same thing on all of them like I did on the white	sd	5
I did the same thing on all of them like I did on the white	I  would times the two by whatever like the one third	sd	5
I  would times the two by whatever like the one third	Say  two times three is six	sd	5
So you re telling me you got that because two times three is  six	Right	b	1
Erin	I got three bows	sd	4
Andrew	I got four	sd	4
Brian	I have three	sd	4
Who s  gonna tell me	Well I think three because well it s just the same as the  other one	sd	5
Well I think three because well it s just the same as the  other one	You like you take this and you divide it in three  pieces and you get three	sd	5
What s the  length of each of those pieces	Two thirds	sd	4
How can you convince  us each piece is two thirds	You can measure it	sd	4
What do you  think	If this is two thirds it would be right here	sd	5
If this is two thirds it would be right here	This is one third and that s two thirds then three  thirds	sd	5
Gregory you like that Gregory	One then two wait hold on	sd	1
Yes thank you very much	You have the blue and you have this is and you take you  have a white	sd	5
Ok this is two meters right	Yeah you have a white so that is half of this	sd	5
Ok right I got that	The white is three and then the other white is three	sd	5
The white is three and then the other white is three	So it s  asking you how many two thirds of one meter you would  take a third	sd	5
You have six one third  meters so how many two third meters do you have	Well we have so you have two meters	sd	4
Show me  where two thirds would be	Right there	sd	4
Would you get three or  four	You get so it would be one two wait  there s one two and three	sd	5
You think three	I thought you see what I thought	sd	1
What did you think	No I thought two thirds I thought you had to get two  thirds	sd	4
No I thought two thirds I thought you had to get two  thirds	So you have two thirds two thirds so that s um	sd	4
So you have two thirds two thirds so that s um	I  didn t count the last two thirds	sd	5
So you counted  an extra two thirds	Yeah	b	1
Ok you re convinced of that	Yeah	b	1
Can you do it carefully to be sure that you can explain it  maybe	Yes	b	1
Hum instead of using this method that I was using let s use this method to keep track	I have a question	sd	3
I have a question	Shouldn t you make the square a triangle since the square and the triangle	sd	5
Shouldn t you make the square a triangle since the square and the triangle	I have a question	sd	3
I have a question	What if there is two triangles	sd	3
What if there is two triangles	Two times two plus one equals there should be two triangles	sd	5
Two times two plus one equals there should be two triangles	That is so stupid	sd	1
That is so stupid	Do they have to be the same	sd	2
Do they have to be the same	Can t you put a rectangle down and have it	sd	2
Yeah	That should be	sv	4
Some people use them but the circles look like zeros and if you are	How about a hexagon	sd	4
How about a hexagon	Can we use them	sd	1
Can we use them	A pentagon	sd	4
A pentagon	One and three	sd	2
One and three	A octagon	sd	2
A octagon	Put a stop sign	sd	2
What would I put in the triangle to make it true	One	sd	4
So that what this says is	There is no secret	sd	1
This is the so called truth set again	Is there a secret here	sd	1
Well there might be	I have a question	sd	1
I have a question	If you know it how can it be a secret	sd	1
If you know it how can it be a secret	He is the only one in the world who knows	sd	1
He is the only one in the world who knows	Yeah but somebody else knows it	sd	1
Yeah but somebody else knows it	Your stupid little calculator watch can t bail him out on the stupid problem	sd	1
Your stupid little calculator watch can t bail him out on the stupid problem	Wait	sd	1
Wait	No	sd	1
No	I want to ask a question	sd	1
Okay sure	How do you know like is there a secret for every like if I put a square a rectangle a triangle if I put like all of these different shapes how do you know there is a secret for everything	sd	3
How do you know like is there a secret for every like if I put a square a rectangle a triangle if I put like all of these different shapes how do you know there is a secret for everything	Why did you have to ask that	sd	1
Why did you have to ask that	I just felt like it	sd	1
Stephanie says how do you know there is a secret or not	You have to go through the problems and find out	sd	1
You have to go through the problems and find out	Yeah but it could work	sd	1
Yeah but it could work	You can do like five different problems and it could work and you cannot do this one little problem then it wouldn t work on	sd	4
You can do like five different problems and it could work and you cannot do this one little problem then it wouldn t work on	Maybe just one	sd	1
Maybe just one	Maybe it just works on everything else but that one	sd	4
Maybe it just works on everything else but that one	Yeah but then it doesn t work then	sd	2
Yeah but then it doesn t work then	Okay what about the secret that we just figured out	sd	3
Okay what about the secret that we just figured out	That won t work on Milin s problem	sd	4
That won t work on Milin s problem	Maybe we fixed it	sd	2
Maybe we fixed it	It might work in Milin s problem	sd	2
It might work in Milin s problem	We just didn t consider using half and fourths	sd	2
We just didn t consider using half and fourths	It wouldn t work	sd	2
If I put one in the box what do I have to put in the triangle to make it true	Go ahead and try it	sd	1
Go ahead and try it	Three	sd	4
Three	Oh God not the watch	sd	1
Suppose I put two in the box what do I have to put in the triangle to make it true	Five	b	4
Five	I think it s five	sv	4
I think it s five	If he knows a secret it s not a secret anymore	sd	1
If he knows a secret it s not a secret anymore	What are you doing	sd	1
If I put three in the box what do I have to put in the triangle	Seven	sd	4
Seven	Seven oh this is so easy	sd	2
Seven oh this is so easy	Four and nine	sd	2
Four and nine	I know the secret	sd	1
I know the secret	So do I Brian	sd	1
So do I Brian	It s no big secret	sd	1
It s no big secret	It goes zero one two three in the square and one three five and seven in the triangles	sd	5
Here is what I want to do	Four and nine	sd	4
Four and nine	Maybe not	sd	4
Maybe not	Anyone would work	sd	4
Anyone would work	Amy you are so lost	sd	2
Amy you are so lost	It s not even funny	sd	1
Do you understand what we are going to do	I don t have a pencil	sd	1
I don t have a pencil	Someone took my pencil	sd	1
You can put your papers the long way if you  want	One fifth	sd	1
One fifth	one tenth	sd	5
one tenth	One tenth would be one two three four five sixth    one two three four five sixth seven eight nine  ten	sd	5
One tenth would be one two three four five sixth    one two three four five sixth seven eight nine  ten	It would be right about there  one tenth right	sd	5
It would be right about there  one tenth right	One hundredth	sd	5
One hundredth	One onehundredth	sd	2
One onehundredth	Would be right here	sd	2
Would be right here	That would be like on top of the zero almost	sd	2
That would be like on top of the zero almost	And then one thousandth would be right there	sd	2
And then one thousandth would be right there	On top of it Like one onehundredths and one one thousands well like one onehundredth would be  right there and   One thousandths would be right on  the zero	sd	5
Then where would one tenthousandths be	You would have to have a bigger thing	sd	4
You would have to have a bigger thing	I think	sv	1
I think	if you squish it together then you could put it  all together	sd	4
if you squish it together then you could put it  all together	Well it depends on  Well	sd	2
Well it depends on  Well	It sort of depends how big	sd	2
It sort of depends how big	No not really because	sd	2
No not really because	Otherwise you would have to squish it all in	sd	4
You were saying Andrew	It would be like something you really cannot see	sd	5
It would be like something you really cannot see	Actually you would need something like a stop watch  to figure it out	sd	5
Actually you would need something like a stop watch  to figure it out	It does not matter what size it is  because you will still have to have one half and a one  third would still take up as much room as anything  else so	sd	5
It does not matter what size it is  because you will still have to have one half and a one  third would still take up as much room as anything  else so	I wonder where one onethousandth would go	sd	3
I wonder where one onethousandth would go	Oh  I know where one onethousandths would go thats  easy	sd	1
Oh  I know where one onethousandths would go thats  easy	I think it would be one onehundredth one  onethousandenths and one onetenthousandths	sd	4
Okay	Dr Maher I think I have oneone hundredth one  onethousandth  and one one umm ten thousandth  or Then you could do one onehundred thousandenths and one onemillionths	sd	4
Dr Maher I think I have oneone hundredth one  onethousandth  and one one umm ten thousandth  or Then you could do one onehundred thousandenths and one onemillionths	How high are we supposed to go	sd	3
How high are we supposed to go	I went to one onehundredth	sd	4
I went to one onehundredth	Up to one onehundredth	sd	4
Up to one onehundredth	Fifty should be here on the one hundredth so  its like	sd	4
Fifty should be here on the one hundredth so  its like	One one Hundreds	sd	2
One one Hundreds	one onethousandth would be at the  window	sd	4
one onethousandth would be at the  window	Would one onethousandth be somewhere on this  line or somewhere near the window	sd	3
Would one onethousandth be somewhere on this  line or somewhere near the window	You would have to make the line bigger	sd	4
You would have to make the line bigger	Probably not	sd	4
Probably not	Michael and  Erik In stead of making it exact but they will be a little  more approximate	sd	4
Michael and  Erik In stead of making it exact but they will be a little  more approximate	Meredith	sd	1
Meredith	I think I know where the hundredths would go	sd	5
I think I know where the hundredths would go	Because zero five ten fifteen 15 would go in there	sd	5
Because zero five ten fifteen 15 would go in there	100 would go in there 1000 would go in there	sd	5
100 would go in there 1000 would go in there	Its like a pattern	sd	5
If youre done and youre waiting for other  people to finish could you mark on your line where  three fourths would be	Three fourths	sd	4
Three fourths	One third one fourth three fourths would probably  be in the middle	sd	4
One third one fourth three fourths would probably  be in the middle	Well three fourths would probably be in the middle  of one fourth and one third	sd	4
How are you all doing here	I mean	sd	1
I mean	Three fourths	sd	4
Three fourths	Oh	b	1
Oh	I think it  would be between them	sd	4
I think it  would be between them	Here	sd	1
I see one third here and I see one third here	Yeah I did it on both sides	sd	4
Yeah I did it on both sides	Yeah I did it on both sides	sd	2
How does that work	Well you see it does not matter because I just did it  on both sides so that it this doesnt like work	sd	5
Well you see it does not matter because I just did it  on both sides so that it this doesnt like work	Yeah that is what I did I did it on both  sides	sd	2
Yeah that is what I did I did it on both  sides	You could go by that way	sd	4
You could go by that way	Or you could go by that way	sd	4
So you just sort have done it a  mirror image  both ways	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah you could just you could just do  it like that	sd	4
I see	Yeah	b	1
I see you put one one hundredth right there	Yeah	b	1
Thats interesting	What I thought was that I was trying to estimate  count all the way up to one half because	sd	4
How many times did you have to count	Like if you wanted to put the exact one hundredth  you would have to make it the length	sd	5
Like if you wanted to put the exact one hundredth  you would have to make it the length	All even	sd	2
All even	The length to count all the way up to fifty by one  half then the other fifty in the other one half	sd	5
Oh	So you would have to imagine  the length	sd	4
What do you think if you were going from zero to  one tenth how many times would you have to count  to place one hundredth	Well zero to one tenth you would have to place one  hundredth about ten times because ten	sd	5
Well zero to one tenth you would have to place one  hundredth about ten times because ten	Fifteen	sd	5
Fifteen	Twenty	sd	5
Twenty	Thirty	ba	5
Thirty	Well yeah I think it would be like ten times	sd	5
And then you could divide it into ten pieces	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	About ten times	sd	4
You all could imagine that can t you	Ohmhum	sd	1
Every time I wanted to measure something I would have to count up all the ones David said didn t he	Yeah	b	1
Now this is really a very interesting idea I think because we often think of a line as going on and on and on without ending you know if I asked you what is the biggest number	Nothing	sd	4
Nothing	It wouldn t be on	sd	4
You can look it up	Yeah	b	1
I would say I know one bigger just add one to it right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	1
Our question is this line you ll learn when you get to high school geometry but you will learn this when you get to high school geometry but I know that you will learn this before you get to high school geometry we can think of as made up of lots of points	Last year in Mrs Dominica s class we studied points and ohm	sd	4
Last year in Mrs Dominica s class we studied points and ohm	Segments and sections because the number line is just a section of the big line that goes on and on	sd	5
That goes on for ever	forever and there is just a little section  that is taken out	sd	4
You ve heard of infinity haven t you	Umhum	sd	1
And so yes Brian	A lot	sd	4
A lot	Yes	b	2
Yes	The definition of infinity is that it keeps going it never stops	sd	4
How many numbers we can put on this line	No	b	1
No	It would take a long time	sd	4
Go ahead and talk to your shoulder partner please for a quick moment	Ya vi que este no no esta  bien	sd	4
Ya vi que este no no esta  bien	No esta  bien	sd	4
No esta  bien	Porque este esta  cobrando mas que tiene que cobrar	sd	5
Porque este esta  cobrando mas que tiene que cobrar	Si no fueran aqui fueron 24	sd	5
Si no fueran aqui fueron 24	Oh si	b	2
Katie	Because its showing you that with with On with Online Flix and Mail Flix you still have to pay the monthly fee even though youre not buying any movies	sd	5
Could I have someone restate what Katie just shared	Like even though like it says for either one of them that you have to pay a fee and youre still paying it but on Movie Busters if you dont get anything youre not gonna have a fee to pay	sd	5
Okay	So it goes by what you rent	sd	4
How would you help Student A make sense of it	You would get I think I would get rid of the 0	sd	5
You would get I think I would get rid of the 0	Cause its kind of confusing	sd	5
Cause its kind of confusing	And then start off with 13	sd	5
And then start off with 13	Instead of 12	sd	5
Instead of 12	So they dont think that 12 plus 12 is 24	sv	5
So they dont think that 12 plus 12 is 24	So I would get rid of the 0	sd	5
What else could we do what else could a person suggest to Student A to help them with their table	You could tell them that you dont have to pay the first fee for every rental you just have to pay 1	sd	4
Okay so if you were to help them figure out that this was not 25 what would you tell them	Uh that you dont pay the flat fee for every rental you just pay 1	sd	4
So what would it cost for 1 movie from Online Flix	13	b	4
And how did you get your 13	Because 12 plus 1 is 13	sd	5
Okay	I got to add the odd number	sd	5
I got to add the odd number	Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	sd	5
Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	One plus three is	sd	5
One plus three is	Its just adding three	sd	5
Its just adding three	You find the answer easily	sd	5
You find the answer easily	1 plus 3 is 4	sd	5
1 plus 3 is 4	4 plus 3  is 7	sd	5
4 plus 3  is 7	7 plus 3 is 10	sd	5
7 plus 3 is 10	You just keep on adding three and you get all of your  answers	sd	5
I want to see if it is the same	I just got one thing	sd	1
Ariel	Seventy six	sd	4
Seventy six	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Seventysix for what	sd	3
Seventysix for what	For whats the name what was the one again	sd	3
Twentyfive	Yeah twentyfive	sd	1
How you got seventysix	Its not no seventysix its eighty	sd	4
Its not no seventysix its eighty	First ten times two  the thing of it is thirty  so then it would be 30  times 2 is 60 then 5 is 16 plus 16 is 76	sd	5
First ten times two  the thing of it is thirty  so then it would be 30  times 2 is 60 then 5 is 16 plus 16 is 76	Ten plus five is fifteen	sd	5
Ten plus five is fifteen	What happened	sd	3
What happened	Ten plus five is fifteen	sd	5
Ten plus five is fifteen	What happened	sd	3
What happened	Ten plus five is fifteen	sd	5
Ten plus five is fifteen	OK	b	1
Why did you do times two can you tell me	Oh because she said twentyfive so the thing for ten is thirty and ten  times two is twenty so thirty times two is sixty that will be twenty and  then for the five is sixteen	sd	5
Oh because she said twentyfive so the thing for ten is thirty and ten  times two is twenty so thirty times two is sixty that will be twenty and  then for the five is sixteen	What	ba	1
What	This is what I got	sd	1
This is what I got	I got eighty	sd	4
I got eighty	Five times five is twenty five	sd	5
Five times five is twenty five	Five times eleven is fiftyfive	sd	5
Five times eleven is fiftyfive	Five times sixteen is eighty because  I just found that out	sd	5
Five times sixteen is eighty because  I just found that out	So I got eighty	sd	5
So I got eighty		sd	1
	Ten times eight is eighty	sd	5
Ten times eight is eighty	Huh	b	1
Huh	and then thirty times eight is	sd	4
and then thirty times eight is	Two hundred and forty	sd	2
Two hundred and forty	Seventyfive	sd	4
Seventyfive	Seventyfive	sd	4
If X equals twentyfive then  what does Y equal	Huh	b	1
If X equals twentyfive so Y equals	Seventyfive	sd	4
And James you said when X equals twentyfive what does Y  equal	Huh	b	1
When X equals twentyfive what is Y equal	Eighty	sd	4
So what  do you guys think	Oh wait a minute	sd	1
Oh wait a minute	It is seventysix	sd	5
It is seventysix	If you follow  my rule  twentyfive times    oh wait a minute  so I must have  messed up somewhere because twentyfive times three is seventyfive  plus one is seventysix like I got up here	sd	5
What do you think James	I got eighty	sd	4
I got eighty	I dont see how he got it	sd	3
I dont see how he got it	Well Im going to go by my rule	sd	4
Well Im going to go by my rule	Just do the rule on the number	sd	1
Just do the rule on the number	Twentyfive times three plus one   but  wait a minute	sd	4
Twentyfive times three plus one   but  wait a minute	Do you even have the same rule as me	sd	3
Do you even have the same rule as me	Exactly	aa	1
Exactly	You have a different rule	sd	2
You have a different rule	Thats why	ba	1
Thats why	But my rule worked	sd	4
But my rule worked	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Like this one had two different rules	sd	5
Like this one had two different rules	It could have  more than one rule	sd	5
It could have  more than one rule	Seventysix	sd	4
Seventysix	SeventysixYeahhh	b	2
So I want you to explain to  each other whats your rule  and whats your rule	Mine is times three plus one	sd	4
And you explain what your rule is	Mine is every number odd add in order like plus one plus three plus  five	sd	4
What are you adding that plus one plus three plus five to	To X	sd	1
To X	What do you say	sd	1
What do you say	I start off with one then add the next  number by three then add the next number by five then seven then  nine add odd number in that order	sd	5
Does that make sense to you	Yeah	b	2
We have a few ideas here I ve  seen about four different five different models	We have like six	sd	1
Let s get	I think we may	sd	4
I think we may	We have six or seven models	sd	4
Let s hear it	The orange and the red would be one and the dark greens would be a  half and the light greens would be a quarter	sd	4
The orange and the red would be one and the dark greens would be a  half and the light greens would be a quarter	And um it we think it will be bigger we think one half would be  bigger than one quarter by one quarter because it takes two quarters  to equal that	sd	5
And um it we think it will be bigger we think one half would be  bigger than one quarter by one quarter because it takes two quarters  to equal that	And why we think that is because four is um two more  than two so it would take two fourths to equal two two pieces	sd	5
And why we think that is because four is um two more  than two so it would take two fourths to equal two two pieces	Because there s four pieces and then they would have to put those  two pieces together to make two pieces	sd	5
They added some extra ideas  what do you think Andrew	Is the green and the light green supposed to be uh are you going to  have the fourths to it	sd	1
Is the green and the light green supposed to be uh are you going to  have the fourths to it	What do you mean	qy	3
What do you mean	There s no fourths what rod is the fourths	sd	4
There s no fourths what rod is the fourths	One fourth is a quarter its another name for a quarter	sd	4
One fourth is a quarter its another name for a quarter	It s looks like you have a dark green there	sd	2
It s looks like you have a dark green there	This is just it s one of the regular ones because we ran out of the  greens	sd	1
This is just it s one of the regular ones because we ran out of the  greens	Yeah but do you have four fourths	sd	1
Yeah but do you have four fourths	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	One two three four	sd	1
Cynthia	This person thought in rows instead of columns and for every row he had 3 Vs and 1 C	sd	4
Yes sir what did you want to add to that	I think that theres maybe kind of a fraction way	sd	4
What do you mean	Like for in every row theres 4 columns I mean 4 rows	sd	4
Im understanding now	So then 1 is given to Cindy and 3 is given to Valerie so 1 4 is given to Cindy in each row	sd	5
And then go ahead and share with your partner when youre ready	The second one  I think its the second one	sd	5
The second one  I think its the second one	Because for each 3 that Valerie eats she gives one to her friend Cindy	sd	5
Because for each 3 that Valerie eats she gives one to her friend Cindy	I mean give one candy to Cindy	sd	5
How about the first one	This first one is stopping confusing	sd	3
This first one is stopping confusing	I think the second one is better because	sd	4
This one	Because if youre looking its confusing 3 Valeries and then 1	sd	4
And  let me get your name  Ashank nice and loud	I think that it would be also a good thing	sv	5
I think that it would be also a good thing	Because your brain in the first one your brain is its like very complicated to calculate like all the candies and the things that Valerie will eat and Cindy	sd	5
Because your brain in the first one your brain is its like very complicated to calculate like all the candies and the things that Valerie will eat and Cindy	But in the second its easy to calculate	sd	5
Okay so you think this one is a little harder to interpret	Yeah	b	1
What did you want to add Saurabh	I think the first one would be easier because because when you put the  it will be easier for people to understand because you can just draw the figure and put Vs in the ones that Valerie eats and then C in the ones Cindy eats	sd	5
I think the first one would be easier because because when you put the  it will be easier for people to understand because you can just draw the figure and put Vs in the ones that Valerie eats and then C in the ones Cindy eats	So then you can go in a kind of pattern 3 for Valerie 1 for Cindy	sd	5
So then you can go in a kind of pattern 3 for Valerie 1 for Cindy	Then 3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	sd	5
Then 3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	sd	5
You think this ones easier to see	Yeah the pattern  to understand	sd	4
Meredith doesn t think so and Mark what do you think	You probably gave Tom the uh bigger a bigger half than  Amy	sd	4
And does that make sense to give a bigger half	Mm hmm	sd	1
How	Well say you gave this was one  and then you gave this much to Tom  and this much to Amy	sd	5
Well say you gave this was one  and then you gave this much to Tom  and this much to Amy	That  wouldn t be a fair cut	sd	5
David	No because it wasn t even	sd	5
What do you mean by that David	Well um the half should be even so that the other side is the  same as it is	sd	5
Well um the half should be even so that the other side is the  same as it is	So the yellow is bigger than the green and the  half should be the same size	sd	5
Brian	Two purple would make a half	sd	4
Each of those would be one half	Yeah	b	1
Audra what do you think	Because see you had the red	sd	5
Because see you had the red	Well if the candy bar was  this size  and you  were to divide it in half and then Amy probably got a piece  like this  and	sd	5
You wouldn t  pull that on a younger brother or sister would you	Yes	b	1
What do you think Caitlin	Cause they re weren t the same size chocolate bar	sd	5
Brian	We re working with halves	sd	4
That s true we re working with halves	Because see since we re working with halves you took these  two together   and you called it called it two and it would be like one candy  bar and the other candy bar	sd	5
Because see since we re working with halves you took these  two together   and you called it called it two and it would be like one candy  bar and the other candy bar	And if you put the reds on top  um I think someone they said that if it was a half if you put  two reds on top of the green and it isn t  cause the two reds is  bigger than one green than one light green and it can t be  half	sd	5
And if you put the reds on top  um I think someone they said that if it was a half if you put  two reds on top of the green and it isn t  cause the two reds is  bigger than one green than one light green and it can t be  half	Just like the chocolate bar couldn t be a half	sd	5
How  do you imagine a half of a candy bar Jackie	Cut it right down the middle	sd	4
Why not  Graham	Cause there s three of them	sd	5
Cause there s three of them	And you would need to have four so I could cut it in half	sd	4
Gregory nice and loud so everyone can hear you back there	Well Danielle will have one row and Dr Landis will have  one row then I would have one row	sd	4
And how many wedges would that be for you	Um four	sd	4
So when you got half Jackie said  you got six out of twelve  and  when we got a third you got how many out of twelve	Um four	sd	4
What do you think Amy	The person who got a half	sd	4
Andrew	I would want the third	sd	4
Of the big one	Yeah	b	1
Michael	Because you uh you were gonna split up a big one so but  then she ran back and got the little one and split that in half  and gave that half to him and then she took the big one and  got a third of it and ate that piece	sd	5
David	The guy with one third	sd	4
Meredith	Which one s bigger	sd	4
Which	Which thing is bigger	sd	4
Is that really fair	No	b	1
Michael	Well normally half is bigger than one third but if you got a  bigger piece of a candy bar or pizza you got a big pizza and  you get and you get half or one third of that then that ll be  more than just a little pizza that you get half of	sd	5
Part of it yeah	Why cant we have the slant length of the cone	sd	1
But because its not a cone were missing this little piece down here	Right	b	1
Okay where would the tip of the cone be	The same place	sd	4
You guys feel like you have a greater starting point	Maybe	sd	1
Maybe	Maybe	sd	1
Maybe	And also	sd	1
Yeah	Im realizing so were back to like trying to find the pattern where if you multiply slant length times the wide diameter you get double the roll radius but only for four of them	sd	5
So if it only works for four of them would that be   would it be a valid solution	No	b	1
So you can test it using all of these values	Okay	b	1
And the two fractions we were comparing were as  Michael said	One half and one third	sd	4
One half and one third and when we were comparing them we asked  by how much some of you came up with a solution to that which  was	One sixth	sd	4
Uh we have learned something about the square do you remember	No	b	1
So uh we can answer the question like that the square of three is equal to nine nine	Right	b	1
Fung Chi Pui	Three times three	sd	4
So that can you write it on the blackboard	Are you tall enough	sd	1
Are you tall enough	Are you tall enough	sd	1
Are you tall enough	Wow so long	sd	1
Can you answer me	I want to write	sd	1
Law Oi Ping	Three	sd	4
Wong Chun Kei	A times A	sd	4
Or	Three squared	sd	4
Can you find the answer	Yes	b	1
Yeung Suk Ping	Negative three	sd	4
You just write this sentence as a as an equation as an equation	The square of A is  A	sd	4
Is it the same	No	b	1
No so you must add	Neg negative	sd	4
Yes just just talk	Uh a negative  equation	sd	4
Another sign	Uh	b	1
In	He wants to be on camera	sd	1
Woo Hau Pang	Negative six	sd	4
Ng Ka Wing	Seven	sd	4
Cheung Ka Wai	Ten	sd	4
To Tsung Him	Thirteen	sd	4
Thirteen	Fourteen	sd	2
So the answer is Lui Man Hing	Twelve	sd	4
No	Twenty	sd	4
Okay uh part G part G So the answer is Choi Ka Man	Thirteen	sd	4
Chan Wai Yan	Negative	sd	4
Huh	Negative 11	sd	4
So Chi Yan	Why are you thinking about it for so long	sd	1
La Lai Chi Fu	Negative	sd	4
Negative square root	Square root of nine	sd	4
If there is no question please do it by yourself	Ah	b	1
Number five	Youre kidding	sd	1
Lo Chi Hung	Negative four times negative four is it is equal to 16 and square root of 16 is four	sd	5
Is it equal equal to negative negative four	No	b	1
Uh it is this	No solution	aa	4
Okay	No solution	aa	4
Is it equal to two or negative two or no solution	No solution no solution	sd	4
So there is	No solution	aa	4
So which number times itself is equal to a negative number	None	aa	4
One is	Negative	sd	4
Or	No solution	aa	4
Maybe it is negative or	Zero	sd	4
Or zero	Positive	sd	4
And then if it is negative what is the result of the square of A	Positive	sd	4
If it is zero then what is the squ square of zero	Zero	sd	4
So is there any answer equal to negative	No	b	1
So read the pages and do the questions	Why is it not over yet	sd	1
Okay this times	Stop joking around	sd	1
Stop joking around	Are you for real	sd	1
Are you for real	Ah its really bad dont	sd	1
Ah its really bad dont	Thank you and goodbye Ms Tang	sd	1
Graham told me	Well one half plus one half equals a whole and two fourths  plus two fourths equals a whole	sd	5
Does that make sense	Uh I think theyre kind of off	sd	5
Uh I think theyre kind of off	Its true but theyre kind of  off	sd	5
Its true but theyre kind of  off	Its true that one half plus one half equals one whole but  two fourths plus two fourths equals four fourths which is one  whole	sd	5
Hold on lets hear what David has to say for a  moment	Well I was thinking	sd	5
Well I was thinking	That uh that like four fourths equals  one half which equals two halves	sd	5
Say that one more time David	Uh four fourths should be equals one half	sd	5
Uh four fourths should be equals one half	four fourths equals one half	sd	2
four fourths equals one half	four fourths	sd	1
four fourths	Two fourths	sd	2
Two fourths	two fourths oh wait one whole	sd	2
two fourths oh wait one whole	four fourths is equal to one whole	sd	5
four fourths is equal to one whole	Yeah thats what I mean	sd	2
four fourths equals one whole	Yeah um and two fourths is equal to one half	sd	5
Yeah um and two fourths is equal to one half	Because um two fourths uh would be equal to right up  right next to is like in the middle of like one whole and um	sd	5
In the middle between numbers	zero and one	sd	4
Ok	and um so then one half of it would be in the same place	sd	4
Ok	So the half would have to be in the same place	sd	4
Ok	because if you put them right next to each other the one half  would be in the same place as both of them because would  one half would be equals on both sides	sd	5
Want to take you picture with you	I just drew it like that  because	sd	5
I just drew it like that  because	thats the one whole um these are the one fourth and thats  the one half and this would be zero and that would be one	sd	5
Can you place your numbers here  now	You mean like one half	sd	4
It helps you to place those  numbers	Yes	b	1
What do the rest of  you think of that	I like it	sd	1
Thank you very much David	I agree with him	sd	2
Jakki	Its sort of like the Cuisenaire Rods	sd	4
Yeah that helps me a lot doesnt it	Its supposed to be the purple rod one fourth would be the  white and the half is like the red or the purple I think	sd	5
Its supposed to be the purple rod one fourth would be the  white and the half is like the red or the purple I think	Well I think it is sort of a new way to make a number line	sd	4
Its a way to build it isnt it	Yeah	b	1
Michael	Uhm I when I was working at home trying to make a  number line I um found out that if you um do like one whole  divided by two you would need would get like one half  because you would take one plus like that and then or  you could get two fourths if you divided it by two so that  would prove that two fourths and one half are the same	sd	5
James	Uhm I have another way to do it	sd	1
Uhm I have another way to do it	I also drew a picture	sd	1
Ok do you like to share it with us	Ok	b	1
Would you like to do it on this side	Ok	b	1
Ok	This is one half  and this is two  fourths  two fourths I made a circle  and divided it into 4ths and colored in two fourths and it  shows it equals one half	sd	5
This is one half  and this is two  fourths  two fourths I made a circle  and divided it into 4ths and colored in two fourths and it  shows it equals one half	One side of this and two sides of  this both are one half	sd	5
What do you think of that	s I agree	sd	2
And that  would therefore enable you to put them in the same place on  the number line	Yes	b	1
Okay um were doing revision from yesterday on the congruent triangle so do you remember what a con what a pair of tria congruent triangles are	Yep	b	1
Yeah	Two triangles that are the same	sd	4
Same what	Same angles same sides	sd	4
Which line is equal to B C	Im sorry	sd	1
Do you want me to repeat it	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Number one angle F	sd	4
Yep	Number two angle C	sd	4
Yes	Number three 60 degrees	sd	4
Yes	Number four 90 degrees	sd	4
Yes	Number five A D	sd	4
Yep	Number six A B	sd	4
Yes	Number seven four centimeters	sd	4
Yes	Number eight five centimeters	sd	4
Yes	Number nine triangle A B C is congruent to three lines	sd	4
Three lines	to triangle D E F	sd	4
She hasnt got it right	Oh F E D	sd	4
Triangle to triangle what	F E D	sd	4
F E D	D E F	sd	2
D E F	You said F E D	sd	2
Why did I say F E D	Because that tells  the same	sd	4
Whats the same	Like F equals A	sd	4
So F equals A and whats equal to C	D	b	4
So youve really got to write these in the same order	Oh	b	1
All right	And 10 is A B	sd	4
Just to show the congruence to show the relationship between them	Im doing them in alphabetical order	sd	1
Who got nine right	Yeah I did	b	1
Can you talk together	Where did you want us to move	sd	1
Heres a All right	How am I going to work	sd	1
So the task you need to produce a list of instructions so that anyone following them will construct exactly the same triangle	Oh	b	1
You actually have to follow the instructions	Do you make up instructions	sd	1
So youve got to draw your triangle first on the second page and then write down your instructions	Is there one in the drawer	sd	1
You draw it on the second sheet the top of the second sheet	Where it says your triangle	sd	1
Yep	Do you need to draw two dont you	sd	1
No just one	So miss the person thats giving the instructions	sd	1
Everyone draws a triangle and writes down their instructions	All right	aa	1
All right	So you want us to draw one triangle	sd	1
Just one triangle	Do you draw the triangle like this	sd	4
You ha yeah you use your protractor and your compass to draw the triangle	Can I trace this	sd	1
Yeah	Okay Ill use it after	sd	1
But youre not going to draw the same triangle are you	No	b	1
Yeah	Can I sharpen the pencil	sd	1
Pardon	I said I dont want to get up in front of the camera	sd	1
Yes you can	Im just waiting for a compass	sd	1
Im just waiting for a compass	Is that what were going to be doing finding the angles and stuff	sd	4
You can either find angles or you can find sides	Okay	b	1
Or a combination of both	So I could write all my angles and all my sides couldnt I	sd	4
You could but thats not the minimum number	Oh so you	ba	1
You might have a lot of instructions to start with and then you find after a couple that theyve actually drawn it	Okay	b	1
You should be doing yours up here	I am	sd	1
Youre not supposed to know what it looks like	Um I need to make a measurement	sd	1
Um I need to make a measurement	When I measured it its like that  Do I write like five point whatever	sd	1
Yes youll have to yeah	Okay	b	1
Okay	Im up to you	sd	1
Have you all finished	Yeah	b	1
When you all or uh three or four of you have finished the triangle you can start the first person can start reading theirs out	Okay can I read mine out now	sd	1
Has Jessica finished	Um when we write the instructions will it be in here	sd	1
Um when we write the instructions will it be in here	And um when we write it would it be draw up a five point six centimeter	sd	1
Depends on what you want to do	How many instructions do we have to have	sd	1
Okay	Yep	b	1
Yep	Is that right just like draw	sd	1
Yeah yeah	A line	sd	4
Yeah well youve got to read it out to the other two now theyre not to know what you have got	I know but	sd	1
Yes	Is that is that all you have to do	sv	1
Yes	Oh okay	b	1
Rightyo	Is mine right	sd	1
So youve got to try it	Okay	sd	1
Okay	It doesnt work	sd	1
It doesnt work	Shes deliberately not responding	sd	1
Shes deliberately not responding	Im responding	sd	1
Im responding	Shes like  because	sd	1
Shes like  because	Draw a half circle	sd	4
Draw a half circle	I said uh	sd	1
I said uh	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yes there you go	sd	1
Yes there you go	Okay now go to H	sd	1
Okay now go to H	Yes	b	1
Yes	Make radius six centimeters	sd	4
Make radius six centimeters	Yes	b	1
Yes	Okay have you done that	qy	1
Okay have you done that	Yes	b	1
Yes	Now draw an arc from H bisecting the arc from S	sd	4
Now draw an arc from H bisecting the arc from S	Okay	b	1
Okay	Using your compass measure the distance from	sd	4
Using your compass measure the distance from	Okay now you ready for this	sd	1
Okay now you ready for this	That was  point N so write point N Now draw Now draw a line from N to S	sd	5
Yes	Okay all right trace a set square but its two minimum isnt it	sd	4
No no I dont want that	Thats why I didnt think you wanted	sd	1
I want lines and angles	Thats what I thought	sd	1
All right	Yep	b	1
Because they might have a different size set square	Okay	b	1
Okay	Oh yeah	b	1
True	Yep	b	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Did it work	Well I knew how to say radius but I had to say it wasnt	sd	4
All right because if it if theyve worked you need to cut them out and give them back to Jessica	Were going to do them after	sd	1
All rightyo okay	So were doing one	sd	1
So were doing one	This just make a radius of five centimeters	sd	4
This just make a radius of five centimeters	Okay	b	1
Okay	Im not ready	sd	1
Im not ready	I think mines right	sd	1
Youll find out wont you	Yep	b	1
Yep	Can you can you can you bi I drew a line	sd	4
Yes	And I sort of bisected	sd	4
So did you decide that that was important or the length of the line was important	The length of the line oh no the angles	sd	4
All right	Interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	sd	4
Interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	A B	sd	2
A B	Yeah interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	sd	4
I think you can see theyre pretty right cant you	Interval A C is horizontal and it measures three centimeters	sd	4
So did it work	Uhh no because	sd	1
If they fit on top	Theyre the same but	sd	4
Theyre the same but	Its the same but	sd	2
She didnt have to did she	Shes got nice paper	sd	1
Do you want a different color	Im kidding no	sd	1
Im kidding no	So thats right	aa	1
So thats right	Theyre theyre congruent	sd	4
So you cut them out and give them is it yours Natalie	Thats mine thats mine	sd	1
All right yeah	Is um is this congruent	sd	4
Is um is this congruent	Because I wasnt here on Tuesday	sd	1
Yeah whats a con congruent triangles are triangles that have the sa exactly the same sides three sides are equal and three angles are equal	I dont cut this out do I	sd	1
She can cut Natalie can cut hers out	Oh can I cut this out	sd	1
Oh all right	This is mine	sd	1
This is mine	Thats mine	sd	1
So have you done one yet	Yeah weve done two	sd	1
All right	Okay	b	1
Okay	Hang on	sd	1
Hang on	Ive figured it out Miss	sd	1
Ive figured it out Miss	I think anyways	sd	1
I think anyways	I Im doing the the measurements	sd	4
You can make combinations	Oh I dont get this	sd	3
Oh I dont get this	Lets get the triangle and measure everything	sd	1
Yeah and and do the instructions on how to make it	Okay well whats the  gonna be because	sd	1
So have you done two	One	sd	1
One	Eight point seven centimeters	sd	4
Eight point seven centimeters	I dont think that was necessary	sd	2
I dont think that was necessary	Mines like five centimeters long	sd	2
Mines like five centimeters long	Mines eight point seven	sd	2
Mines eight point seven	Jessica	sd	1
Jessica	Mines eight point five	sd	2
Do you are you using yeah a compass to draw the	We would have to measure the	sd	4
Ah right	It was 60 degrees	sd	4
Thats all right	And it was six centimeters long	sd	4
And it was six centimeters long	And then	sd	1
And then	Draw a line from the top down to the	sd	5
Draw a line from the top down to the	Draw a line at 40 degrees that is five point one centimeters long	sd	5
Draw a line at 40 degrees that is five point one centimeters long	Miss what should we do now	sd	3
Pardon	What should we do now	sd	3
Have you done all of them have you	Yep	b	1
Yep	Yeah	b	1
Well did you end up working out how many instructions you actually needed for each one	Yep I needed four	sd	4
You needed four what were they	Um interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	sd	4
Um interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	Interval A C is horizontal	sd	4
So if its saying horizontal its saying its at an angle arent you	Yeah	b	1
So were saying ones vertical and ones horizontal	Yeah and you um	b	1
Then youre defining the angle between them arent you	Mm Im saying its a right angle	sd	4
Yes	Because interval interval A B C is a right angle	sd	5
Right so did they need all those instructions to finish your triangle	Yes	b	1
Yes	Draw an arc from angle uh angle C joining to the B C which is the hypotenuse and draw a dot in any	sd	5
All right so you started with a line that was vertical	Yep	b	1
And then a line that was horizontal of a certain length	Yep	b	1
And then you joined them	Yes	b	1
So what did you	And it was a right angle	sd	4
Yes and the right angle so you had two sides and a right angle and then joined them	The arc on the arc on angle C and then join the interval	sd	4
Right did you actually have to have so did you tell them what length that was	No	b	1
No	I just said join it	sd	1
No you didnt have to	Which is the hypotenuse	sd	4
Yes so you only needed two sides and the right angle	Yep	b	1
What did you need	Three	sd	4
And what was it	Okay I took my set square and drew a straight line nine centimeters for the base	sd	5
Okay I took my set square and drew a straight line nine centimeters for the base	Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square	sd	5
Its well how long was the base did you say	Um nine centimeters	sd	4
And so you drew a right angle as well	Yeah	b	1
Yes	Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square along the line the end on the corner and drew a straight line up six point two centimeters	sd	5
Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square along the line the end on the corner and drew a straight line up six point two centimeters	Yes	b	1
Yes	Number three I then joined the both ends up with the right angle triangle	sd	4
So you had the same thing you had a right angle and two sides	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And the degrees were 90 degrees so	sd	4
Did you have anything different	Nope	sd	2
You had the same thing	Almost	sd	2
You all did right angles	Yep	b	1
So no imagination	Nope	sd	1
So thats one of the think and see if you can think of the same triangle if you couldve given different instructions to have done the same triangle	Yep	b	1
See if you can all end up with different ideas	Okay	b	1
So how did you end up	Good	ba	1
Good	Good	ba	1
Good	We all won	sd	1
We all won	We have to check them	sd	1
We have to check them	I won	sd	1
I won	No we all won	sd	1
Yeah were were they all different	No theyre all the same	sd	2
What did you end up having to write	Construct a right angle	sd	4
What did you end up having to draw	Oh	b	1
Oh	Triangles	sd	4
Yeah	Congruent triangles theyre all congruent	sd	4
Yes but what were the instructions	Um I couldnt um	sd	1
Um I couldnt um	Draw an eightcentimeter line	sd	4
Yes	Um make a radius of five centimeters	sd	4
Yeah	She did not say that	sd	1
Yeah thats all right	Um place the point of the compass at the right end of the line and draw a circle	sd	4
Of what size	Pardon	sd	1
Yeah	Um with a five centimeter radius	sd	4
Yeah	Um uh and make a where am I	sd	1
Um uh and make a where am I	Oh make a sevencentimeter radius and draw a circle from the left end of the line	sd	5
Yes	And join where the point	sd	4
So what did you end up doing	The edited version	sd	1
Was it all the sides all the angles a combination	Pardon	sd	1
What did you end up with	All the same sides and angles	sd	4
Yep you end up with all the same angles but what did you tell them to draw sides or angles	Um sides	sd	4
All sides	Yeah	b	1
Did you draw all sides	Um I said an angle of 60 degrees and then but and then two lines	sd	5
Which lines	The beginning line	sd	4
Yes	Was A B 10 centimeters long	sd	4
Yes	And then an angle of 60 degrees at A	sd	4
Yes	And draw a line six centimeters long	sd	4
From where	From A	sd	4
So youve got two lines and an angle	Yes	b	1
And what did you end up with Tanya	Uh	b	1
Yours were all lines as well	Yes	b	1
Yes	Draw an eightcentimeter interval	sd	4
Right	Make a radius of five centimeters draw an arc make a radius of six	sd	5
Make a radius of five centimeters draw an arc make a radius of six	Draw an arc from H bisecting arc from X to form point N	sd	5
Bisect oh you mean intersecting	Oh crumbs	b	1
So youd end up with three sides	No no yes it was	sd	1
Yeah rightyo	Whats the difference between bisect and	sd	3
Bisecting means to cut it in half	Half yeah	b	1
Half yeah	Bi bi	b	1
Bi bi	But it did bisect it	sd	4
But it did bisect it	It cut it in half	sd	4
It depends on how long the line is	It was half a line	sd	4
Yes Louise	How many times do you have to go through them	sd	1
Are you finished	Is that all	sd	1
Yes	Shes just go to do hers	sd	1
Rightyo	We did all ours and they all figured it out	sd	1
Yes	Um with Louises we did	sd	1
When you cut them out you usually cut them out to see if they fit	but they the angles were all the same	sd	4
but they the angles were all the same	We measured the angles and all that	sd	4
Rightyo	Um with Louises she didnt give us any angles	sd	2
Yeah thats okay	But with um mine I gave the angles is that is that all right	sd	4
So which angles do you which angles did you give	I gave a five centimeter line and then a right angle with another five centimeter line	sd	5
And did you do anything different Nerida	Yes and Neridas is good	sd	1
Yes and Neridas is good	I like Neridas	sd	1
I like Neridas	Oh sorry	b	1
Yeah so what did you start with	Um	b	1
Um	I started with a six centimeter line going horizontally	sd	4
Yes	And then found halfway three centimeters and put a dot	sd	4
And then found halfway three centimeters and put a dot	You put the center point of a protractor on the dot	sd	4
Yes	And then you uh find 70 degrees	sd	4
Yes	And you draw a line then put a dot	sd	5
And you draw a line then put a dot	Then you connect um the top point to the bottom right point of the sixcentimeter line	sd	5
Yeah	And Neridas see how she has  like that	sd	1
Yes	And then you you put the pencil on the top dot again and draw it to the  left hand side	sd	4
Well that was very different	I liked hers cause she had like	sd	2
So you ended up with an angle there didnt you	Yep	b	1
Havent you	Yeah	b	1
So youve ended up with two triangles	Yep	b	1
That one and that one	Yep	b	1
That one had a line a line and an angle	Yep	b	1
That one had an angle a line and a line as well	Yep	b	1
Is everyone nearly finished	Yes	b	1
If Ive had a look at yours girls if Ive had a look at yours see if you can draw the same triangle in a different way using different instructions	Do we write down those as well	sd	1
But what did you draw	I drew a triangle	sd	4
What did you start with	A six centimeter line and then I just used compass points and joined them	sd	5
The length of three sides	No I but I didnt include the length of length	sd	4
Yes	I just I just said um draw a six centimeter line set your compass to three centimeters and draw an arc from each end and draw it	sd	5
So that ones three centimeters and how long is that one	I dont know the compa yeah thatd be three centimeters	sd	4
So youve done two the length of the bottom line and the length of each side	No the length of this like how much apart	sd	4
Yeah well thats that determines the length of a line doesnt it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Youve done something different	Used a ruler and protractor	sd	4
And what did you do	Um did eight centimeter line	sd	4
Yes	And then I got the protractor and did 60 degrees	sd	4
Yes	And join that and then join these together and found the measurements of the	sd	5
Right so its two sides and an angle	Yeah	b	1
Whats yours Justine	Um with a protractor	sd	4
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
First of all you started with a line didnt you	Oh yeah	b	1
Yep	And then 60 degrees	sd	4
Right so you draw a line 60 degrees here	And then thats six centimeters	sd	4
So the angle had to be between the two lines	Yes I put that in my notes two sides must be of the angle	sd	4
Must two sides must be	The two like the two cause you said the minimum and I said the two sides must be of the angle	sd	4
All right so its the two sides of the angle yes	Yeah	b	1
Helen	Is it different if you just if you say both angles	sd	4
Yes it is	I just did it that way because you said	sd	1
So youve got a a line	A line and then A B	sd	4
A B	And at A you make it 60 degrees and just draw a line intersecting	sd	5
Yes	And at B youd make an angle 37 degrees	sd	4
Yep	Until their intersecting	sd	4
Yes Kate	Uh another way is you get	sd	1
And whats the other one Kate	And you draw a 90 degree angle	sd	4
Yes	And you join the other side up	sd	4
And you join the other side up	Join the two ends	sd	4
You said Ive got a 90 degree angle what else are you going to tell me	The length	sd	4
So youve got the length of that side and the length of that side is that the same as anything Ive done	No	b	1
No	Like the bisecting ones	sd	4
Youve got the bisecting one	The two sides and an angle	sd	4
Yes	Is it	sd	1
No	Doesnt doesnt the two angles add up	sd	4
Yeah	Yes yes thats right	aa	1
Yes yes thats right	The the angle up the top	sd	4
Yeah	Has those two angles have to add up to 90 degrees	sd	4
They have to add up to 90 degrees but if I define the three angles will I get congruent triangles	Um	b	1
Um	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
Why not	Because theyll be different lengths	sd	5
This one is written as can you guess	S S S	sd	4
Question one on activity seventeen point one	Miss can I	sd	1
Yep	What is S S S	sd	3
Can you see that	Oh	b	1
Ill also check your homework	You said that was due Friday	sd	1
Okay so did you do your homework	Hows that	sd	1
Hows that	That that	aa	1
It was pretty easy you just had to say which sides were equal	What about	sd	1
Ill write these down next lesson anyhow and go over it	Oh	b	1
Did you do your homework	Yes	b	1
Good	I did actually I accidentally did two and two as well	sd	1
I did actually I accidentally did two and two as well	Like I did number two on the other page too	sd	1
These ones	No I did these ones too	sd	1
Did you realize	Yes	b	1
Have you done your homework	Um yes I did	sd	1
Um yes I did	I did those and these chapter seven through	sd	1
Yeah you did exactly the same thing Helen	Um yeah	b	1
Okay	D equals D	sd	4
Okay	Which activity is it	sd	1
Seventeen point one youre doing	Thats not 17 oh	ba	1
So just start those	Okay	b	1
All right did you do your homework	Its very messy	sd	1
Mikala	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I did the other homework	sd	1
Okay thats when you didnt do it the other day	Yeah	b	1
Elise you did werent here	I was in bed	sd	1
Pardon	I was in bed with mumps	sd	1
So you know you understand what were doing today	No	b	1
Congruent triangles have exactly the same three sides equal and three angles equal	Oh	b	1
Have a look at the beginning of the chapter of it and it will say that um that sheet I gave you	Oh okay	b	1
So its just saying three sides are equal and three angles are equal	Oh okay thats pretty easy	ba	1
Howd you go with the revision at beginning of the lesson	Um	sd	1
Nicole did you do your homework	Yeah	b	1
So you did it okay	No I wasnt here and I didnt know about it	sd	1
Yeah	I wasnt here	sd	1
You were here last lesson	No	b	1
No	I I was away	sd	1
Um all right okay	She was away	sd	1
Yep	What page were we on	sd	1
All right girls you may go	Miss what do we do with these	sd	1
Dont lose them	Um do we have maths tomorrow	sd	1
I think so	Well because Im not going to be here tomorrow	sd	1
Well because Im not going to be here tomorrow	Im going to Newcastle	sd	1
All right what for anything interesting	Uh yeah my sisters  competition and	sd	1
Yeah	Okay well Im trying to find my	sd	1
Well know what youre up to	Okay	b	1
Anybody get any numbers for number four	I have it down for like five minutes	sd	1
I have it down for like five minutes	We finished	sd	1
Fifteen times four	Yeah then why has it been down for the last eight minutes already	sd	1
Yeah then why has it been down for the last eight minutes already	Then what is it	sd	3
Then what is it	I got a different one	sd	2
I got a different one	Oh we are on number nine	sd	1
Oh we are on number nine	What is it a one	sd	3
What is it a one	I got a second answer	sd	2
I got a second answer	Seven won t work	sd	2
Seven won t work	Neither will eight	sd	2
Neither will eight	Maybe we should go holler at Amy	sd	1
Maybe we should go holler at Amy	We should check it out	sd	1
So what have we got	Fifteen minus	sd	4
Fifteen minus	We are on the next page	sd	1
We are on the next page	What is it	ba	3
What is it	What is it	sd	3
What is it	It s four	sd	2
It s four	Look on the board	sd	1
Look on the board	I ought to smack you	sd	1
I ought to smack you	I ll do the last one and when I get it I ll tell you	sd	1
I ll do the last one and when I get it I ll tell you	I m doing eight	sd	1
I m doing eight	I guess I have five and six	sd	1
I guess I have five and six	I m gonna check three	sd	1
I m gonna check three	I got a different number	sd	2
Uh it is going to be negative something	Negative fortyfour	sd	4
Negative fortyfour	Thirtysix	sd	2
Thirtysix	It can t be negative though	sd	2
It can t be negative though	It can t be four then	sd	2
It can t be four then	That can t be right	aa	2
That can t be right	That can t be that	sd	2
That can t be that	We have to go by work	sd	2
We have to go by work	Which one has to be higher than seven	sd	2
Which one has to be higher than seven	I got a different one and I know it s right	sd	2
I got a different one and I know it s right	We gave you the answer because you said you want to work with us and then	sd	1
We gave you the answer because you said you want to work with us and then	Number ten	sd	2
Number ten	Let s try three	sd	2
Let s try three	This one is five	sd	2
This one is five	Nine is number five	sd	2
Nine is number five	One times one	sd	2
Uh we need to figure out how much is sixteen minus sixty how much is that	It s eight	sd	2
It s eight	Negative fortyfour	sd	2
Negative fortyfour	Negative fortyfour	sd	2
Negative fortyfour	This is five and that s eight	sd	2
When I say that is equal to zero is that true or false	False	aa	4
False	I ll do five and eight and we ll be done pretty quick	sd	1
I ll do five and eight and we ll be done pretty quick	What did you get for six and seven	sd	3
What did you get for six and seven	I don t know	sd	1
I don t know	I didn t do them yet	sd	1
Okay so we don t want four alright	What are you laughing at	sd	1
Somebody got another number you would like to try	Stop it Jeff	sd	1
Stop it Jeff	I m doing number ten	sd	1
I m doing number ten	We already got nine and ten dimwit	sd	1
We already got nine and ten dimwit	We do	sd	1
We do	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Eight is ten and five is nine	sd	1
Eight is ten and five is nine	What are you always right	aa	1
What are you always right	That s that s	ba	1
That s that s	I m gonna do the last one on this page	sd	1
I m gonna do the last one on this page	We ll all work together first or we ll work separate because Shelly always comes up with	sd	1
We ll all work together first or we ll work separate because Shelly always comes up with	Let s do number eight first	sd	1
If I do that I ve got four	What are we on	sd	1
How much is four minus thirty	Negative twentysix	sd	4
Negative twentysix	Is number five five	sd	2
Is number five five	Negative twentysix	sd	2
So when we say four minus thirty plus twentysix equals zero is that true or false	I ve got eight	sd	1
I ve got eight	I called eight	sd	1
I called eight	Yeah I ll do six that s all	sd	1
Yeah I ll do six that s all	True	aa	4
True	True	aa	2
True	I ve got number five	sd	1
Okay so let s	It works	sd	1
Let s put that in that was two huh two	Are you done	qy	1
Are you done	You probably did all of the answers didn t you	sd	1
You probably did all of the answers didn t you	Most of them	sd	1
There might be another number	There you go	sd	1
How many rules did you guys do	Three	sd	1
James Ariel is writing this number three can  you write the other	He has written  the following table on paper      X Y      0   9      1 12      2 15      3 18      4 21      5 24	sd	1

I will get it	Thats a nine	sd	1
Thats a nine	Huh	sd	1
Huh	Thats a nine	sd	1
Thats a nine	Yeah right here	b	1
Yeah right here	This is pretty easy	sd	1
This is pretty easy	Got it	sd	1
Got it	What is it	sd	1
What is it	It is times two    no it is times three plus six	sd	5
It is times two    no it is times three plus six	What this	sd	1
What this	I  have written what I did yesterday	sd	1
I  have written what I did yesterday	Are we supposed to write all the  rules	sd	1
How you got this	Four times three is twelve	sd	5
Can you explain that		sd	1
Four times	Three	sd	4
OK then	Plus one is thirteen	sd	5
How did you get this	Six times three is eighteen plus one is nineteen	sd	5
Can you explain me this	Huh what	b	1
Huh what	This one	sd	1
Yeah	Oh seven   oh I messed up	sd	4
Oh seven   oh I messed up	No wonder thats why	sd	1
No wonder thats why	Yeah I messed  up	sd	4
Yeah I messed  up	This is twentytwo	sd	4
This is twentytwo	And this is supposed to be twentyfive	sd	4
And this is supposed to be twentyfive	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	Yeah that is  supposed to be twentyfive	sd	1
Yeah that is  supposed to be twentyfive	Ok so this if this is in fact the middle one what does that	sd	4
Ok so this if this is in fact the middle one what does that	I don t know I m  curious to know why you did this why you how you saw this as being helpful to  the pizza problem	sd	3
I don t know I m  curious to know why you did this why you how you saw this as being helpful to  the pizza problem	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Was this helpful to you when you were doing it or no	sd	2
Was this helpful to you when you were doing it or no	Um well not this part but the towers were	sd	4
Um well not this part but the towers were	But thats like because I remembered  how we figured out the total combinations	sd	4
But thats like because I remembered  how we figured out the total combinations	Mhmm	ba	2
Mhmm	That the same thing to figure this out	sd	4
That the same thing to figure this out	So I guess its helpful in that sense but this  wasn t it just	sd	1
So I guess its helpful in that sense but this  wasn t it just	Is there a yeah I was interested when you grabbed that	sd	2
Is there a yeah I was interested when you grabbed that	It was useless	sd	4
It was useless	We were just hoping there was an easier way	sd	2
We were just hoping there was an easier way	well you never know	sd	1
well you never know	We were hoping there was a really easy way	sd	4
We were hoping there was a really easy way	Well I think that the way you did it I mean you started to see some things that  made it easier right	sd	2
Well I think that the way you did it I mean you started to see some things that  made it easier right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I heard you say something about well there s an easier way and look we could get this right away and then you started fiddling with these numbers here	sd	2
I heard you say something about well there s an easier way and look we could get this right away and then you started fiddling with these numbers here	So maybe you did find an easier way	sd	2
So maybe you did find an easier way	I m not quite sure I think this is very interesting and I think it is interesting that these numbers that you see them reflected over there and I m just wondering if there is anything any other relationship between these two	sd	2
I m not quite sure I think this is very interesting and I think it is interesting that these numbers that you see them reflected over there and I m just wondering if there is anything any other relationship between these two	Hmm	sd	1
Hmm	You said something before uh also that interested me uh you said there is supposed to be a two over there or something when you were talking about what you did in Mr Pentozzi s class	sd	2
You said something before uh also that interested me uh you said there is supposed to be a two over there or something when you were talking about what you did in Mr Pentozzi s class	Oh no I think she left like one thing out because like I have it 1 and then I have two 1s because this is like zero toppings	sd	5
Oh no I think she left like one thing out because like I have it 1 and then I have two 1s because this is like zero toppings	Yeah I was thinking that	sd	2
Yeah I was thinking that	And then with one topping	sd	4
And then with one topping	Yeah it s supposed to be like one one	sd	2
Yeah it s supposed to be like one one	Mhmm	ba	2
Mhmm	And then actually that s why our top wasn t working out	sd	1
And then actually that s why our top wasn t working out	Because we were having trouble yeah Bobby thanks for uh telling us before	sd	1
Because we were having trouble yeah Bobby thanks for uh telling us before	As we re all here lost  Got anything Bobby	sd	1
As we re all here lost  Got anything Bobby	noooo I m just not doing anything	sd	1
noooo I m just not doing anything	Bobby s just drawing and we re like  why isn t it working	sd	1
Bobby s just drawing and we re like  why isn t it working	Well he s drawing all kinds of stuff over here so he was really busy	sd	1
Well he s drawing all kinds of stuff over here so he was really busy	So what wasn t working out before when you were missing that other one	sd	1
So what wasn t working out before when you were missing that other one	Oh it was just uhh	sd	1
Oh it was just uhh	Lets say this was plain	sd	4
Lets say this was plain	We would jump from like plain to like two toppings and we had no idea we were like	sd	2
We would jump from like plain to like two toppings and we had no idea we were like	Yeah and that didnt even work for plain so we were like why isn t working for plain	sd	2
Yeah and that didnt even work for plain so we were like why isn t working for plain	Yeah so were like that s not working	sd	2
Yeah so were like that s not working	Of course Bobby had the answer all along and didn t care to share with us	sd	1
Of course Bobby had the answer all along and didn t care to share with us	Got anything over there Bobby	sd	1
Got anything over there Bobby	No I don t have anything	sd	1
No I don t have anything	But hey we wont hold that against him	sd	1
But hey we wont hold that against him	Well he wanted to give you an opportunity to think about this	sd	2
Well he wanted to give you an opportunity to think about this	to look really stupid	sd	1
Now my next question is How many pizzas how many towers are these problems	The same	sd	4
The same or	Mhmm yeah	b	1
How can you convince me that these are the same problem	Its easier to explain the two thing with this because there are only two colors	sd	4
You like that huh	Yeah	b	1
I think that s easier to see that with the two colors I think most people	Its all the toppings it throws you off you expect like 800 pizzas	sd	4
Its all the toppings it throws you off you expect like 800 pizzas	Yeah mhmm	b	2
So that the toppings don t	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Toppings is the height	sd	4
Toppings is the height	Like 4 toppings would be a tower 4 high and then the two colors would be with or without toppings	sd	5
Like 4 toppings would be a tower 4 high and then the two colors would be with or without toppings	I guess that would work	sd	1
I guess that would work	Mhm	ba	2
That s what you just told me right	Yeah	b	1
In the pizza if you were thinking of	Peppers or oh no no it would be	sd	4
Peppers or oh no no it would be	It would either mean you had a topping there or you didn t have a topping there	sd	2
It would either mean you had a topping there or you didn t have a topping there	Yeah	b	2
Oh So  b  means you either put whatever topping is	Right	b	2
Right	Is that what you are trying to say	sd	2
Is that what you are trying to say	Yeah but like it wouldn t work because you d have more than one a topping	sd	5
Yeah but like it wouldn t work because you d have more than one a topping	I think he s on the right track but	sd	2
Lets follow that thinking right	So	b	1
Fair enough	Mhmm	aa	1
Ok so you have four toppings so let s go through our toppings right	Mhm	ba	1
We have what are they	Well for which	sd	3
Well for which	Peppers	sd	4
For four high	We have	sd	1
So this would mean you either choose peppers or you don t	Mhmm	aa	1
Mhmm	You choose peppers or you don t	sd	1
You choose peppers or you don t	No you choose mushrooms or you don t you choose sausage or you don t  and you choose um pepperoni or you don t because your going to have four of them	sd	5
No you choose mushrooms or you don t you choose sausage or you don t  and you choose um pepperoni or you don t because your going to have four of them	And each one is gonna have like if it was written like that like here would be mushrooms like going all the way across and each tower you had with an  r  there meant that you didn t have mushrooms	sd	5
Ok	You know what I mean	sd	1
You know what I mean	So youre gonna have all the towers four high like that	sd	5
So youre gonna have all the towers four high like that	And for each one with an r there you have mushrooms on it Or you dont have know and just like thatmushrooms on it	sd	5
And for each one with an r there you have mushrooms on it Or you dont have know and just like thatmushrooms on it	You know	sd	1
You know	And then heres the peppers and if theyre you	sd	4
Ok I wonder I know that you have to leave	Mhm	ba	1
Mhm	There are 11  men in the room	sd	1
There are 11  men in the room	There are 6 women in the room	sd	1
There are 6 women in the room	How  many fewer women are in the room	sd	1
How  many fewer women are in the room	Why do you like using the	sd	1
Why do you like using the	I like it	sd	1
Okay have you gone on to the second problem yet	Yes	b	1
You can go on  after you do the problem you can go on to the third one  before	It s five	sd	4
It s five	It s one two three four five six	sd	2
It s one two three four five six	One two three four five six women	sd	5
One two three four five six women	And then you go from  here one two three four  five	sd	5
Now eleven cubes or you  can use eleven cubes	Jim has 3  tennis	sd	1
Tennis balls	balls	sd	1
balls	Jim has 1 fewer tennis ball than Don	sd	1
Jim has 1 fewer tennis ball than Don	How many  tennis balls does Don have	sd	1
Okay so Jim has three has  tennis balls and Don has how many more	Fewer	sd	4
Fewer	It s two	sd	4
You think that s two	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	It s one fewer	sd	4
You think it s two	Yeah	b	1
Jim has one fewer  Think	Jim has one fewer	sd	1
Jim has one fewer than Don	Fewer fewer fewer fewer fewer	sd	1
Fewer fewer fewer fewer fewer	Four	sd	4
Four	One	aa	2
Jim has one fewer than Don so what does that make Don  have	That makes Don have four	sd	4
Let s  see if Jim has three does he have one fewer than Don	Yeah	b	1
What did you have to  do with the three and one to get that answer	Um I put three	sd	4
You have to add it	I took three and put one more	sd	5
I took three and put one more	So I added	sd	5
And now does Jim have one fewer than Don if Don  has four	Yes	b	1
All of you were Able to follow it	Amy tell me what she was saying	sd	1
I m thinking of the same rows can you tell what I am supposed to imagine  in my head with towers	Isn t like so many high and then so	sd	4
Ok so tell me so this  would be how high	That would be three high right	sd	4
That would be three high right	Yeah	b	1
Three high	Three high and then its how many colors you have	sd	4
remember we did it on the bottom	Yeah	b	1
If you had blue and red	If you have blue and red if you had two colors	sd	1
So what does the one represent	One of all like say blue like three high of all blue cubes	sd	4
Mhmm ok I could imagine that and what does the three represent	You could have like um three towers where you have like 2 blue and one red  umm	sd	4
So now you have	two red and one blue	sd	4
If your making this all blue and your making this	Oh that would probably be	sd	1
Oh that would probably be	I think that would be one the way that it would work  out it would be one blue and two reds and the next would  be two blue and one red	sd	5
How many blues are here	All	aa	4
All	Three	sd	2
So this your going from three blue to one blue	Oh I dont know	sd	3
Oh I dont know	Three blues to two blues	sd	4
Three blues to two blues	Too one blue to none	sd	2
Too one blue to none	Or you could do it the other way around with three reds	sd	2
So tell me where the 4	Okay	b	1
Because she hasn t played with it for a  long time right	Yeah I guess you could say that	sd	1
You too Shelly you haven t played with this in a while so you can help me	That would be four like four blue three blue two blue one blue no blue Or	sd	5
How does the one plus three  give you the four	Because youre just adding the extra block on	sd	5
Can you see them	Mhmm	aa	1
How do you see the three of them with exactly one red	Umm one with a red at the top	sd	4
Umm one with a red at the top	One with the red in the middle and one with a red at the bottom	sd	4
You all could imagine that	Mhmm	aa	1
So how do we now get these four with one red	Umm wait I have to think	sd	1
Alright	These are all blue Right	sd	4
These are all blue Right	And these are one blue	sd	4
And these are one blue	Is that what were saying	sd	1
These are	No red	sd	2
No red	So these are all blue and these are one blue	sd	2
So these are all blue and these are one blue	Yeah hehe same thing	sd	2
Youre much more expert  on these towers than I am without having them in front of me	Oh these are all blue these are two blue	sd	4
Oh these are all blue these are two blue	I m sorry	sd	1
I m sorry	That was	sd	1
Right or no red and one red	Ok that was	sd	1
Ok that was	Yes	aa	1
Yes	So here all you re doing is adding one red	sd	4
So this has to be a one red	Yes so you already have um three with one red so here this becomes the fourth  one with one red because here there is no reds	sd	5
Yes so you already have um three with one red so here this becomes the fourth  one with one red because here there is no reds	And each of them get a block like  added to them how do I ok	sd	5
I can see my little stack here and this little stack here there is only one of them  and its all blue no red right	Yeah where is your picture	sd	1
Yeah where is your picture	Do you have your picture to that	sv	1
Why don t you make a picture	Ok	sd	1
Ok	So here is you have the one  three high with all blue	sd	5
So here is you have the one  three high with all blue	Then you have the three with one red so you have red  blue blue blue red blue blue blue red	sd	5
Then you have the three with one red so you have red  blue blue blue red blue blue blue red	And then these two make	sd	5
And then these two make	This one is  four blues	sd	5
This one is  four blues	Well that was	ba	5
Well that was	ok and these two together make um  the one with four the four with one red	sd	5
ok and these two together make um  the one with four the four with one red	So this one gets a red added on because  its already got three blues so it cant have any more blues	sd	5
So this one gets a red added on because  its already got three blues so it cant have any more blues	And then these three  all get a blue added on to it	sd	5
Because they already have one red	They already have one red	sd	1
Does that make sense	Mhmm	aa	1
Anything we remembered about  making these ribbons that would be an important kind of  thing to have noticed	Well I noticed that after a while like it started making a  pattern	sd	5
Ok You want to say a little bit more about that	Well um I forget what pattern but I think it was going like  it started going in three six nine like  like when it said  when you had like different size ribbons and every time it  got like  like three times bigger and it kept doing it in all  different kinds of patterns I thought	sd	5
Well um I forget what pattern but I think it was going like  it started going in three six nine like  like when it said  when you had like different size ribbons and every time it  got like  like three times bigger and it kept doing it in all  different kinds of patterns I thought	Yeah because at first it went two three four five	sd	5
Yeah because at first it went two three four five	And then it went   Michael and the second one went uh the second one went four  eight something like four six yeah	sd	5
I dont remember any two four six or four eight	No its four it s four six eight ten  and then there was  that odd and then there was that two thirds one	sd	5
Ok lets lets let s hold out  Brian what were you just  saying	Well if we remember we had the three meters you would  always like times the number by three	sd	5
Well if we remember we had the three meters you would  always like times the number by three	Like you go three  six nine	sd	5
Michael	Uh one half	sd	4
Is it shorter than this length	Uhh huh	b	1
Jessica what  do you imagine	Well I imagine if you like pull the ruler into like three  pieces and then it would be like like up to the um I think  wait um thirtythree mark I think	sd	5
Well how how did you decide on the thirtythree mark	Well that s what I think because um um thirtythree plus  thirtythree plus thirtythree is ninety nine and that s   Michael No but there s a hundred   Jessica Yeah and then a hundred around like thirty three and like a  half almost	sd	5
What do you think	Jackie your hand up partially	sd	1
Something around that	I think there  it s thirtythree and one third because if you  take two more thirds you can get it to a hundred	sd	5
Thirtythree and a third	Yeah	b	1
That what youre imagining so this	Im I m imagining it just being cut into three equal halves	sd	4
A hundred what  here	A hundred centimeters	sd	4
How do you know that	Because it only goes up to ninetynine but theres an extra  length that could be a centimeter	sd	5
This piece over here	Mmm hmmm	sd	1
So youre telling me there are a hundred  centimeters here and youre telling me that if you were to  make three equal parts Graham what do you think	Well theres ten decimeters	sd	4
Ten decimeters well	Well thats ten centimeters and then theres ten decimeters	sd	4
How do you get ten decimeters	Well theres well theres ten centimeters in a decimeter and  theres ten of them on that so it would go to a hundred	sd	5
Well theres well theres ten centimeters in a decimeter and  theres ten of them on that so it would go to a hundred	What	ba	3
What	Ten centimeters plus ten centimeters plus ten  centimeters is	sd	5
Were going to hear Jessicas theory  now	Um	b	1
You  helped me with that and in faT2 you were very precise about  helping me with that and how many bows can you make	Um I think you could have made um oh I forget um	sd	1
Why dont you all sit and talk to your partner for a minute  and confer and see what you think	What do you think I think	sv	3
What do you think I think	How many	sd	3
How many	I think its nine	sv	4
I think its nine	I forget what I wrote on my paper	sd	1
I forget what I wrote on my paper	Three meters so	sd	4
Three meters so	Yeah you can make three bows	sd	2
How many bows  can I make from three meters of ribbon	One third of a meter	sd	5
One third of a meter	So if this  is a meter and  then	sd	5
So if this  is a meter and  then	and then this is a meter then this is a meter	sd	5
and then this is a meter then this is a meter	so this would be divided into thirds	sd	2
so this would be divided into thirds	Three six nine	sd	4
Three six nine	Yeah	b	2
Alright but a bow is going to be what do you think one  third of what	I think I thought in order to make bows I thought you can  make three of them	sd	4
From one meter	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	From from here to here	sd	4
Mmm hmm	For one meter and like like what I was saying like thirty  three and it would be somewhere arond there	sd	4
Right but now I have three meters of ribbon	Three meters	sd	4
Three meters	Oh three nine	sd	4
Laura	Yeah  because three times three is nine	sd	5
Yeah  because three times three is nine	Because three times three is nine	sd	5
Ok James	Um Andrew  um we think um its nine and  theres nine in three meter sticks	sd	4
Ok	That s what we think	sd	1
Ok and you could persuade us everybody that that s the  case	Yeah	b	1
Ok	It would be  like	sd	1
It would be  like	Can I ask Mrs Palmer	sd	1
Can I ask Mrs Palmer	Can we ask Mrs Palmer if we could borrow her meter  sticks or no	sd	1
Right here	Yeah	b	1
Alright	And then the other one right there	sd	4
And it s a third between Amy and  myself well how many to a meter then	Three	sd	4
How did you get that	Three times three three times	sd	4
Well is that right	I think so	sv	2
I think so	Yeah	b	2
Well heres here s one meter stick and I have how many  how many bows from here	You have three meters in one and then three meters	sd	4
You have three meters in one and then three meters	But doesnt it	aa	1
Doesnt it what hon	I dont know	sd	1
Alright well how many bows do you have here	Three	sd	4
How many how many uhh bows do you have in this one	Three	sd	4
Here comes the third one how  many do you have here in this third one	Three	sd	4
Youre sure	Yeah	b	1
If you think you know your means then use it	Can we take our papers back and start um	sd	1
Well you wont need it yet	Ok	b	1
Ok	Heres two  meters I mean one meter	sd	4
You mean twentyseven three times is eighty one now tell  me what you did here	I did twenty I did seven times three and that equals this  never mind	sd	4
Tell me what you did I want to know what you did Alan	Well its wrong anyway	sd	4
Well what did you do though	I did I multiplied seven times three and got twenty one	sd	5
Twentyone	And then I put the two up there added that times it and got  twelve now its wrong	sd	5
Ok so that particular rule didn t work now what did you  do Kimberly	I did twentyseven times three	sd	4
And how did you do it	I times twenty I times three times seven I got twentyone  so I carried the two then I did three times two and added  the two to my answer	sd	5
I mean Alan showed me here three times  if you have three times twentyseven that means you have a  twentyseven three times and he proved to me that its  eightyone how does why does that work	because you add that	sd	5
I dont understand why it works	Because youre basically doing is writing you have twenty seven three times	sd	5
Mmm hmm	And then you get your answer eightyone	sd	4
And then you get your answer eightyone	Its just youre just adding it faster	sd	2
Does it always work	No	b	1
Doesnt always work	But it does sometimes	sd	4
But Alans was different	Yeah	b	1
You know what it means  right	Yeah	b	1
Something to think about right	Yeah	b	1
Would it  work if you had twenty three times and seven three times	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Uh maybe uh I dont think so	sd	2
But you think so	I dont think so	sd	4
She doesnt think so you do	Yeah I do cuz you have twenty	sd	2
Right	if you have seven three times	sd	4
if you have seven three times	Add them together you d have to add them together	sd	2
Ok right	You would have to add them together	sd	4
What do you mean you have to  add them together Kimberly	You would have to add those two answers together to get	sd	4
You would have to add those two answers together to get	Because if you wanted to do it faster	sd	1
Here	Because you wouldnt be able to get the answer for this if  you were using this and you would try to get the answer  eightyone you wouldnt be able to get the answer unless  you added the two answers together	sd	5
Because you wouldnt be able to get the answer for this if  you were using this and you would try to get the answer  eightyone you wouldnt be able to get the answer unless  you added the two answers together	I dont know	sd	1
So those are the problems youre  working on I just want to be sure you know all know the  problems youre working on now	Ok now we have eightyone thats just extra	sd	4
Ok now we have eightyone thats just extra	Nine you got nine right	sd	4
Nine you got nine right	We got nine	sd	4
We got nine	So did I	sd	2
So did I	Lets get some paper to write this down on	sd	1
Lets get some paper to write this down on	I like your sweatshirt	sd	1
I like your sweatshirt	Guys this is math youre  on camera	sd	1
Guys this is math youre  on camera	Youre on camera and youre like oh nice  sweatshirt	sd	1
Youre on camera and youre like oh nice  sweatshirt	You can do that out at the playground	sd	1
You can do that out at the playground	Guys are you on the first one	sd	1
Guys are you on the first one	Seven times three and you get the twentyone	sd	5
Seven times three and you get the twentyone	You add  the sixty and the twentyone and you get the eightyone	sd	5
You add  the sixty and the twentyone and you get the eightyone	Now you get it	sd	2
Now you get it	Neither do I	sd	1
Neither do I	Got it	sd	1
Got it	What Im doing is you have your twentyseven so you take  off the seven and you get and you only have twenty	sd	5
What Im doing is you have your twentyseven so you take  off the seven and you get and you only have twenty	So  then you do twenty times three and you get sixty which  brings me to step two	sd	5
So  then you do twenty times three and you get sixty which  brings me to step two	You dont have two so you have the  seven	sd	5
You dont have two so you have the  seven	So you do seven times three and that equals twenty one	sd	5
So you do seven times three and that equals twenty one	So you add the sixty and the twentyone and you get  eight one	sd	5
So you add the sixty and the twentyone and you get  eight one	Ok	b	1
Ok	I think I got it	sd	1
I think I got it	Alright I dont get it	sd	1
Alright I dont get it	You still dont get it	sd	2
You still dont get it	Ok Ill put it in a lot more words	sd	1
Ok Ill put it in a lot more words	Cuz Im not sure about something	sd	3
Cuz Im not sure about something	I  think were supposed to try make a rule for that	sd	4
I  think were supposed to try make a rule for that	Not that one it was wrong	sd	4
Not that one it was wrong	Ok  I m confused	sd	3
Ok  I m confused	Ok you added twentyseven before you multiply you take  off the seven and then you get twenty	sd	5
Ok you added twentyseven before you multiply you take  off the seven and then you get twenty	And then you have  twenty times three and that equals sixty	sd	5
And then you have  twenty times three and that equals sixty	So then you go to  step two	sd	5
So then you go to  step two	You dont have the two there anymore so you have  the seven	sd	5
You dont have the two there anymore so you have  the seven	You do seven times three and that equals twenty one so you add your two answers and you get eighty one	sd	5
You do seven times three and that equals twenty one so you add your two answers and you get eighty one	Got it	sd	1
Got it	Good	ba	1
Good	So	sd	1
So	Ok what do we have to do now	sd	1
Ok what do we have to do now	Ok what do we have to  do now	sd	1
Ok what do we have to  do now	What do you want to do now	qy	1
What do you want to do now	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	We finished the problem so	sd	1
How much ribbon do you have	We have six thousand five hundred and sixty one yards um  meters of ribbon	sd	4
Did you have a calculator check your computation	And right now were tying ourselves down to get nine  meters of ribbon	sd	4
And right now were tying ourselves down to get nine  meters of ribbon	We re tying ourselves down	sd	4
Literally Erik you re literally tying yourself down	Yay we got	sd	1
Well did you figure it out Alan	For the strategy for the strategy	sd	1
Tell me	Twentyseven meters	sd	4
Ok Did you discuss it with Kimberly	Yeah	b	1
Did you both agree on this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Finally she got it	sd	2
Oh I cant wait	Yeah I got confused	sd	1
Yeah I got confused	Alright so you have the twentyseven before you multiply  it and you take off the seven and you have twenty so then  you multiply twenty three times and you get sixty	sd	5
Mmm hmm	And so you go to step two	sd	5
And so you go to step two	Then you dont have the two  anymore and you only have the seven	sd	5
Then you dont have the two  anymore and you only have the seven	And you multiply  seven times three and you get twentyone	sd	5
And you multiply  seven times three and you get twentyone	So then step  three you add sixty and twentyone and get eightyone	sd	5
Can you suppose someone cause I dont understand why  this procedure works I understand what you explained to  me but I want to know why this works cuz this seems to  work too	It does work	sd	4
But why does it work is my question to you	First can you explain the problem	sd	1
First can you explain the problem	Ok well all it is is you have the twentyseven but on his  you took the seven away	sd	5
Ok well all it is is you have the twentyseven but on his  you took the seven away	And all I did was multiply the  twentyseven and	sd	5
And all I did was multiply the  twentyseven and	You did	aa	2
You did	I multiplied it together instead of having to multiply it  separately and add them together	sd	5
Ok but tell me how you multiplied it together	Ok	b	1
In other words tell me what you did what did you do when  you multiplied	Well I put twenty seven times three equals  so I I  times the seven and the three and I got twenty one	sd	5
Well I put twenty seven times three equals  so I I  times the seven and the three and I got twenty one	I carried the two but	sd	4
Is that a two	In multiplication you dont carry	sd	4
Is that a two	Well I learned to do that	sd	1
Ok Kimberly is that a two	This is a one but my question  is is that a two	sd	\\
This is a one but my question  is is that a two	Yeah but why do you have the two up there	sd	3
Yeah but why do you have the two up there	Because two   because two added to two times three equals six you had  hold it two times two two plus two	sd	5
Because two   because two added to two times three equals six you had  hold it two times two two plus two	No what I learned to do was	sd	1
No what I learned to do was	times three equals twelve	sd	4
times three equals twelve	What I learned to do was do was multiplication then you  add that to your multiplication answer	sd	5
This is two tens I learned	But what I learned is you put the one there and then you  carry the two like you do in adding but you times the  number so I times three times two and then whatever you  got as your multiplication answer you added that number to  that and you put and then once you got there you got your  answer	sd	5
I understand that but I want to know why it works	I dont know why	sd	1
Alan	Well what she is doing is she multiplied seven times three  and got twentyone	sd	5
Well what she is doing is she multiplied seven times three  and got twentyone	She carried the two and added those  and multiplied it twice	sd	5
Ok well you gotta think about that one	But wait	sd	1
But wait	But	sd	1
Im not saying I dont agree  that it works but I dont know why it works	Kim you might have to rephrase your number problem  here	sd	5
Kim you might have to rephrase your number problem  here	Because what youre doing is your doing seven times  three is twentyone youre carrying that and you only  multiply every number by two	sd	5
Because what youre doing is your doing seven times  three is twentyone youre carrying that and you only  multiply every number by two	Maybe I should divide it into steps or something	sd	4
Maybe I should divide it into steps or something	If you can explain it that way	sd	2
If you can explain it that way	I think I can	sd	4
I think I can	Alright put it in steps	sd	2
Alright put it in steps	Let me try	sd	1
Let me try	And then Ill read your	sd	1
And then Ill read your	Alright I have an idea I gonna put it a little bit like that  ok	sd	1
Alright I have an idea I gonna put it a little bit like that  ok	No I keep making messing up	sd	4
No I keep making messing up	I m gonna do  it my own way	sd	1
I m gonna do  it my own way	I keep making mistakes on this	sd	4
I keep making mistakes on this	You want me to get a calculator	sd	1
You want me to get a calculator	No	b	1
No	Alright go use a calculator	sd	1
Alright go use a calculator	No I got it I got it	sd	1
No I got it I got it	Where is x	sd	1
Where is x	Ok ok ok I only have one little step hold on hold on	sd	1
Ok ok ok I only have one little step hold on hold on	Alright step one twentyseven times three equals sixty  one	sd	5
Alright step one twentyseven times three equals sixty  one	What	ba	3
What	No come here	sd	1
No come here	Look see this right here	sd	1
Look see this right here	If you I brought  that over	sd	5
If you I brought  that over	And then you do that you do those and then you  do that if you didnt if that number didnt exist youd have  sixtyone but then you take that and you add that two but  that two becomes a twenty and then you add it	sd	5
And then you do that you do those and then you  do that if you didnt if that number didnt exist youd have  sixtyone but then you take that and you add that two but  that two becomes a twenty and then you add it	So I I cant  explain this problem	sd	1
So I I cant  explain this problem	I can t explain how I did it I just  know how to do it that way	sd	1
I can t explain how I did it I just  know how to do it that way	Wait lets see	sd	1
Wait lets see	I know that twentyseven times three equals  eighty one	sd	5
I know that twentyseven times three equals  eighty one	Right	b	2
Right	It says right here	sd	1
It says right here	Right	b	1
Right	And if you do twentyseven times four it only equals it  equals one oh nine	sd	5
And if you do twentyseven times four it only equals it  equals one oh nine	Right there I typed that in	sd	1
Right there I typed that in	Anyway  um twentyseven equals so theres your eightyone	sd	4
Anyway  um twentyseven equals so theres your eightyone	Now  the way youre doing it cant be done on the calculator	sd	2
Now  the way youre doing it cant be done on the calculator	I know	aa	1
I know	Youre ignoring the two	sd	2
Youre ignoring the two	Forget that two	sd	1
Ok show me how you did three times twentyseven and got  seventyeight	We just kept on adding	sd	4
Well rather than adding three is there another  way you can do it	Times	sd	4
You said you could have twenty  you said you could add three twentyseven times	Yeah	b	1
What does three times  twentyseven mean	Three times twentyseven thats seventyeight	sd	5
Show me	I did	sd	1
What does it mean to have three times twentyseven	Twentyseven three times	sd	4
Ok thats true	Eighty one	sd	4
Seventyeight is that possible	Twentyseven three times	sd	4
You kept adding threes	No I guess we counted wrong	sd	4
Maybe you added twentysix times	Yeah that would be eighty one and that number would be  eightyone	sd	4
Can you show me how to do that	What do we have to do	sd	3
Three times twentyseven	Yeah and then you get eightyone	sd	4
Laura	Yeah	b	2
Three times twentyseven what did you do there	First I did three times seven is twentyone put down a two	sd	4
First I did three times seven is twentyone put down a two	Carry the two	sd	2
Carry the two	and then three times two is six plus two is seven I mean  eight	sd	5
and then three times two is six plus two is seven I mean  eight	And you get eightyone	sd	5
What does that mean the twentyone	The twentyone means that you re seven fourteen twenty one that youre taking the seven	sd	5
The twentyone means that you re seven fourteen twenty one that youre taking the seven	Youre taking the seven three times	sd	2
Youre taking the seven three times	Three times	sd	2
What does twenty one mean	Twentyone means that two times	sd	4
Ok	Yeah like if you have like last year we were doing about  these things and they were like ten blocks in there and then  we had two of them	sd	4
Oh ok yeah two tens	And then we had the one	sd	4
Ok so Im confused when you say carry the two youre not  carrying two of these	No were carrying two tens	sd	4
What does this  carrying the two mean	Because	sd	1
What are you thinking	I was thinking it would be alright because this this two is  in the tens column	sd	5
Does  that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Do you think you can explain it	Yeah	b	1
Because some people dont know why that works so I want  you to think about that	And that	sd	1
Ok well Beth lets see if Beth can explain it to you and be  sure you all agree and come up and write up why you think  that works	Because two is in the tens column and so is that so	sd	5
Because two is in the tens column and so is that so	So it would be so its like youre carrying  two tens	sd	4
So it would be so its like youre carrying  two tens	Yeah and plus two tens	sd	2
Yeah and plus two tens	Now lets keep doing this	sd	1
Now lets keep doing this	How many were we up to	sd	3
How many were we up to	Well we have to change that to an eightyone	sd	4
Well we have to change that to an eightyone	How much wait	sd	3
How much wait	You have to change this	sd	4
You have to change this	Change it to an eightyone	sd	4
Change it to an eightyone	Now lets go see how much eightyone meters is outside	sd	4
Now lets go see how much eightyone meters is outside	Now I now I have to change this to an eightyone	sd	4
Now I now I have to change this to an eightyone	What	ba	3
What	This	sd	4
This	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	This	sd	4
This	Now we gotta do this eightyone times	sd	4
Now we gotta do this eightyone times	Ok keep working	sd	1
Ok keep working	What were we up to	sd	3
What were we up to	Ok thats thirtythree down there	sd	4
Ok thats thirtythree down there	And thats thirtythree	ba	4
And thats thirtythree	Its thirtythree too	sv	4
Its thirtythree too	Its sixty six	sd	5
Its sixty six	Because its thirtythree  here and thirtythree here sixtysix	sd	5
Because its thirtythree  here and thirtythree here sixtysix	Fiftyseven fiftyeight fiftynine sixty	sd	1
Fiftyseven fiftyeight fiftynine sixty	Sixty now Im going to go to  the next page	sd	4
Sixty now Im going to go to  the next page	I guess right	aa	1
I guess right	Ok	b	1
Ok	Two for every meter	sd	4
Ok and	That means if you had  divided by how many  other meters you have but I think you should do two times  wait if you have eightyone meters and you want to find  out how many ribbons should be in that you know that two  ribbons can be made out of each meter	sv	5
Ok	So that means two times eightyone and your answer is one  hundred and sixtytwo which is obviously the answer youd  have to give	sd	5
Mmm hmmm Ok what did Kim what if instead	If you had a thousand	sd	4
Then what would you do	That would be times four	sd	4
Why does multiplying by two or  three or four work	Uh because uh thats the num thats the its like a four  and if youre using um a fourth and you use four its sort of  like youre just using regular numbers	sd	5
Ok so if I have one meter of ribbon and they were a fourth  of a meter how many bows could I make	Four	sd	4
Do you agree with that	eight twelve	sd	4
eight twelve	So that would be if you had eight one and then you d have  to multiply that by four you get three hundred and twenty four bows	sd	5
Three hundred and twentyfour bows if I had eightyone  meters of ribbon	Ok	sd	1
Ok	Three hundred and twentyfour meters would be the entire  perimeter of this school	sd	4
Wow are you up to measuring that out	No aT2ually this long hall is eightytwo so it would be only  one meter less than that	sd	5
No aT2ually this long hall is eightytwo so it would be only  one meter less than that	So if you would do it again you would have one thousand  two hundred thirtysix	sd	5
Ok	Times four	sd	4
Times four	If you use the answer of eightyone times four  youd get I dont know	sd	4
If you use the answer of eightyone times four  youd get I dont know	Youd just keep going and then  divide it by the number of	sd	4
Youd just keep going and then  divide it by the number of	In this	sd	1
The calculators not going past a million	The calculator quit	sd	1
You need a bigger calculator	No the calculator quit it said error	sd	1
Do you feel better about  being able to explain this	I think so	sv	1
Can you try it can you praT2ice on me before she asks you  to explain this	I don t think I can	sd	1
Yes you can	Oh I could tell you how I could explain mine	sd	1
Ok Kim why does this work	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	I m confused that s why I can t do it	sd	3
Well you just told me some beautiful things about all the  patterns and relationships here	Well I m confused	sd	3
Well I m confused	It  quit	sd	1
Ok How far did you go	We went up to three point eight seven four two six four  eight	sd	4
You have  twentyseven times three is eightyone	Twentyseven times three is eightyone but if and if you  have one meter and it was times four by fourths you get  four bows and if it was by thirds you get three bows so the  third or the fourth would be three or four	sd	5
I understand you got it by multiplying by 3	We got an answer	sd	1
We got an answer	She asked us what what would you get  how many bows would you get if you had three times nine  and we got twentyseven and she said how many bows  would you get if it was three twentyseven	sd	1
Ok so this is how much ribbon you have	Yeah	b	1
You have twentyseven meters of ribbon	Right	b	1
Ok and tell me again why youre multiplying by three	Because she said how many ribbons can you make out of  twentyseven meters out of um if youre making three  thirds	sd	1
If youre making a third ok I understand that perfeT2ly  well I think youre fine	But I m confused	sd	2
Its kind of a hard  idea	Yeah	b	1
Yeah I think thats what it is	Its easy to learn it but its hard to explain it	sd	1
ok	Carrying the two	sd	4
Carrying the two	Now what is your way of doing  that	sd	3
Now what is your way of doing  that	You multiplied the three times what Kim did is she  multiplied the three times the seven and then carried the two  up there	sd	5
You multiplied the three times what Kim did is she  multiplied the three times the seven and then carried the two  up there	We carried because that s	sd	4
We carried because that s	Just show me how you did yours	sd	1
Just show me how you did yours	Thats I did the same thing as Kimberly	sd	2
Thats I did the same thing as Kimberly	I know but	sd	1
I know but	And it works because this two is ten and that two is ten and  when you add them	sd	5
And it works because this two is ten and that two is ten and  when you add them	Its forty	sd	2
Its forty	No because you do three times two	sd	2
No because you do three times two	Right and that would be six	sd	2
Right and that would be six	And then plus two more	sd	2
And then plus two more	Is eight	aa	2
Is eight	Right	b	2
Right	But wait what youre doing is youre only multiplying that  two and adding that twenty onto that youre not multiplying  that two	sd	5
But wait what youre doing is youre only multiplying that  two and adding that twenty onto that youre not multiplying  that two	What youre doing is youre just adding that onto  there	sd	5
What youre doing is youre just adding that onto  there	Youre not multiplying that two	sd	5
Youre not multiplying that two	You re not supposed to	sd	2
You re not supposed to	Youre not supposed to youre not	sd	2
Youre not supposed to youre not	you have you learned that last year right	sd	1
you have you learned that last year right	And you had  Ms Firestone right	sd	1
And you had  Ms Firestone right	Then I know why youre getting a  different answer than him	sd	2
Then I know why youre getting a  different answer than him	He had  and I had  Warwick and you had Firestone	sd	1
He had  and I had  Warwick and you had Firestone	So maybe Warwick and  Firestone taught the same thing but  didn t	sd	1
So maybe Warwick and  Firestone taught the same thing but  didn t	So  that s why Alan s confused and we know what we re doing	sd	2
So  that s why Alan s confused and we know what we re doing	Well I made up one of mine and this is what I did	sd	1
Well I made up one of mine and this is what I did	First  you have your um twentyseven then you take off the seven  and you only have twenty	sd	5
First  you have your um twentyseven then you take off the seven  and you only have twenty	So you multiply twenty by three  and you get sixty	sd	5
So you multiply twenty by three  and you get sixty	So then in the step two you only have  your seven left so you multiply seven times three and you  get twentyone	sd	5
So then in the step two you only have  your seven left so you multiply seven times three and you  get twentyone	You add sixty and twentyone and you get  eightyone	sd	5
It s a different way isn t it	Very different	sd	4
Have you tried it for any other numbers to  see if it works	We did um we did um we can make out of nine meters  we can make twentyseven bows out of twentyseven  meters you can make eightyone bows and then out of  eightyone meters we got two hundred and twentyfourty  but nows its even so now we think its two hundred and  fourtythree	sd	5
We did um we did um we can make out of nine meters  we can make twentyseven bows out of twentyseven  meters you can make eightyone bows and then out of  eightyone meters we got two hundred and twentyfourty  but nows its even so now we think its two hundred and  fourtythree	Yeah it is	aa	2
Yeah it is	I got the same thing with the calculator	sd	2
I got the same thing with the calculator	And we were  doing it like this	sd	1
And we were  doing it like this	Yikes yikes yikes	sd	1
Oh ok	So we must have made an error	sd	4
What can I ask you I mean you probably have said this to  Dr Maher but I wasnt over here why are you multiplying  by three	Well because she asked us	sd	1
Well because she asked us	The first problem that we had to do was if we had three  meters	sd	1
Does it have to do with that three meters of ribbon	Cause you had to multiply it by the number of three by the  number of meters you had	sd	5
Cause you had to multiply it by the number of three by the  number of meters you had	Because its a pattern or something	sd	5
Ok its a pattern Im real	It just seems to be working	sd	4
Im real confused though about why the three why why  multiply by three why not multiply by two	Because the problem was to only have three meters	sd	5
Because the problem was to only have three meters	Right	b	2
Right	That wasnt the problem	sd	2
Ok what if I had	Had it been two meters this would have only been	sd	4
What if I had started with um six meters	Twentyseven times six	sd	4
Ok and I wanted to make bows that were a third a meter	And twentysix	sd	4
Six meters of ribbon	Hold it	sd	1
Bows that were a third a meter in length each	Times three nine no	sd	4
Times three nine no	Ok I got that too	sd	4
Ok I got that too	I think its	sv	1
Where did you get twentyseven from	We just did  only we pulled out the three and  put the six in we just doubled the three	sd	5
We just did  only we pulled out the three and  put the six in we just doubled the three	Right all we did  was we kept the twentyseven but we just doubled the three	sd	5
I dont want you to think about any of the past  stuff weve been working on today	Ok	b	1
Ok  New problem the problem is I have seven meters of  ribbon	Seven	sd	4
How many bows would I get	Youd get twentyone	sd	5
Youd get twentyone	Because seven times three is twenty one	sd	5
Because seven times three is twenty one	Right	b	2
We started  with seven meters	Right so that would be seven times seven	sd	4
Thats what I  dont understand	And youd get fortynine	sd	4
And youd get fortynine	No	b	2
Ok now youre saying something different here ok why	So you multiply the number of meters you got by the  number by the fraT2ion youre making	sd	4
So you multiply the number of meters you got by the  number by the fraT2ion youre making	The third is just like the three its like a regular number	sd	4
Is it	It isnt its sort of used as a regular number but its really a  third	sd	4
It isnt its sort of used as a regular number but its really a  third	Yeah what you do is you take the number of ribbon you  have and then make the fraT2ion the fraT2ion like one third  the three multiply the number of meters you have and then  you get your answer of how many bows can be made out of  them	sd	5
Oh youre using some sort of a rule here	Yeah cause say I had fifty fifty meters and I wanted a  third of each of those meters	sd	5
Yeah cause say I had fifty fifty meters and I wanted a  third of each of those meters	That would mean each meter  gets three parts so you multiply this by three and I get a  hundred and fifty so thats how many bows you can get	sd	5
You ll have to say that again	AT2ually the fraT2ion that you have the second digit in  fraT2ion is the number you multiply the number of meters  that you have	sd	5
AT2ually the fraT2ion that you have the second digit in  fraT2ion is the number you multiply the number of meters  that you have	That means if I had seven and I wanted to  divide it into fourths you go seven times four equals  twentyeight	sd	5
So when you say the second number of the fraT2ion you  mean the number on the bottom in the fraT2ion	So the second number of the fraT2ion like it one fourth	sd	4
Ok I see you have a slash line its the second number	The second number on the right side of the slash	sd	4
The second number on the right side of the slash	And then  you multiply by the meters that youve got and then you get  your answer of how many bows can be made out of em	sd	4
That seems to  work	Yeah	b	1
So Danielle you dont know how to  prove it	Kind of	sd	1
Sarah how would you prove  it	Um you go three	sd	4
Were listening to the  proof gentlemen	You go three plus three plus three and that would equal  nine	sd	5
You go three plus three plus three and that would equal  nine	And	sd	1
And	Or three times	sd	2
Or three times	Thats why because you have three meters and take  and  you have three one thirds in each meter so three three  threes and that equals nine	sd	5
Jackie Danielle does that make any sense	I think its three meters times three meters equals nine  meters	sd	5
Danielle do you agree or disagree	Yeah thats what I did	sd	2
You think thats a good idea	Well you can times it but you can add it too	sd	4
What are some  ways of doing this	Three times three	sd	4
Erin	Uh we took string and went out in the hallway and  measured the nine meters out	sd	4
You measured nine  bows or nine meters	Nine meters	sd	4
Im confused we started with three meters	Ok um I didnt have to um measure it out	sd	1
You didnt have to measure that one so that one you had  the three meters and what did you what was the question  you were asking you didnt have to measure it so how did  you do it	Um I did the first way umm three times three	sd	4
Jackie	Well well see we had three meters so you put three down  and youre trying to divide it into thirds so you put another  three down and then you times it and that would equal up to  nine	sd	5
Ok so youre telling me that in the one meter you have  three thirds is that what youre telling me	Mmm hmm	sd	1
You didnt do it that way	No Im trying to think	sd	1
Andrew	Well me and James did three times three like that and we  got the three and three because um you eventually have  three meters and so one third three so you have three thirds  of a meter so thats three thirds of a meter so thats three  times three meters equal nine meters nine meters	sd	5
Well me and James did three times three like that and we  got the three and three because um you eventually have  three meters and so one third three so you have three thirds  of a meter so thats three thirds of a meter so thats three  times three meters equal nine meters nine meters	Yeah	b	1
Do you agree with that	Yeah	b	2
Is that when you measured it in the hall  Erin	Yeah	b	1
You had nine meters of  ribbon	Umm and we measured it out and um	sd	4
So what did you do out in the hall we couldnt see you   What were you doing out there	Well um	sd	1
So whats the question you measured out nine meters out  there and youre making bows how long were the bows	One third	sd	4
Did you have one third meter string	Yeah	b	1
What  did you do Mark	Well we measured out um yeah we measured twenty seven meters	sd	4
You ended up with twentyseven of them	Yeah we	b	1
Erik We did we did it with Erin we did it with Erin	We did it with twentyseven meters	sd	4
Those of you who did it  without measuring it Sarah what did you do	We timesed	sd	4
Or twentyseven	Yeah and then we kept on timesing by three whatever the  answer was	sd	4
How many bows can you make	We re using nine meters right	sd	1
You have nine meters of ribbon and now your bows are  three meters in length	Ok you have nine meters of ribbon and your bows are  three meters in length	sd	5
Ok you have nine meters of ribbon and your bows are  three meters in length	If you have wait yeah if you have  three meters all you have to do is multiply three times three  and you get nine meters because you if you have if each	sd	5
Ok so how many can you make	You can make three three bows	sd	4
So youre saying if I have nine meters and Im making them  three meters in length we could make three bows	Yes	b	1
David	I think the same thing because um if each one takes up  like a meter um nine divided by three that that would be  three ribbons	sd	5
Each one takes up three meters	Yeah each one takes up three meters	sd	4
Yeah each one takes up three meters	Oh yeah wait a minute um it would be its like three  times three would equal nine so uh nine divided by three  equals three um  its just because if you have three  plus three plus three so you can if each one takes up three  meters then you can make three bows out of nine	sd	5
Oh yeah wait a minute um it would be its like three  times three would equal nine so uh nine divided by three  equals three um  its just because if you have three  plus three plus three so you can if each one takes up three  meters then you can make three bows out of nine	Because  you have three meters and then um alright one bow would  take up three so thered be six meters left another bow  would take up three so then there would be uh three meters  left and then thered be a third one and there wouldnt be  there wouldn t be any ribbon left	sd	5
What you did and why	So whatever answer you did	sd	1
So whatever answer you did	Whatever answers you did	sd	1
I need two   people to volunteer for something	He got the whole class	sd	1
I   guess	So they raise their hands higher	sd	1
Now this is the really   tricky job here	Oh me	sd	1
Oh me	Oh not me	sd	1
Amy Lynn would you would you   say go	Go	b	1
You have to say it loudly	Go	b	1
How many do you want him to put in	Seven	sd	1
Seven	All of them	sd	1
Okay you agree he put seven in	I believe so	sd	4
Now are there more of those pieces of glass in the bag uh  than there were when Amy Lynn said go or there are     fewer	There are more now	sd	4
How many more	Seven	sd	4
Seven	Seven more	sd	2
This was a   seven because he counted in seven okay then but this is it is it true that there are seven pieces of glass in  that bag	There is more than seven	sd	4
There is more than seven	At least seven	sd	2
What is it that this is saying	That he added seven	sd	4
Saying that there are more	Uh huh	b	1
Well I guess in some sense this is adding seven but this is saying as a result	Seven more	sd	4
How many would you like Milin to take out	Twelve	sd	1
Okay	Twelve	sd	1
Twelve	Jeff is counting	sd	1
Jeff is counting	Because I am good	sd	1
Because I am good	I ll make it hard on him	sd	1
I ll make it hard on him	How many is he taking out	sd	3
That was twelve	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
No	No I don t think so	sd	1
No I don t think so	Yeah I think he took one more extra	sd	4
Yeah I think he took one more extra	I think he took an extra one at least	sd	2
I think he took an extra one at least	He took an extra every single time	sd	3
Okay what will I write here to say he just   took twelve out	A little minus by the twelve	sd	4
Now at this point are  there more of those pieces of glass in the bag uh or fewer  than when Amy Lynn said  Go	There is less	sd	4
There is less	Less	sd	2
Less	Fewer	sd	2
Fewer	Less	sd	2
Does everyone agree with that	Yes I do	sd	2
Somebody come and   write it	Seven minus twelve equals five	sd	5
Uh Matt would you come and write that	Sure	b	1
Sure	They can hear you you know	sd	1
Can I change it a little bit	Go ahead	aa	1
We want it to say there are five less in the bag okay	Uh huh	b	1
Brian you want to come and   try it	to erase that	sd	1
Is it okay that we change it that  way	I believe it s okay	sd	1
Jeffery would you say go	Go	b	1
Are there more in the bag now or fewer than when Jeffery   said go	More	aa	4
More	One more	sd	2
One more	One more	sd	2
So if I wanted to write that ld say this	Say eighteen	sd	4
It says that he counted one in	Yeah but since I said go	sd	1
One more than  what	Than there were	sd	4
Than there were when	When Amy Lynn said go	sd	4
When Amy Lynn said go	No	b	1
No	When Jeff said go	sd	4
When Jeff said go	Oh don t confuse me now	sd	1
Oh don t confuse me now	One more than it s like five	sd	4
One more than it s like five	Thirteen	sd	2
Thirteen	Minus five plus one it s minus four	sd	5
Minus five plus one it s minus four	Yeah but since I said go not Amy Lynn	sd	1
Right	Oh since when he said go	sd	1
Oh since when he said go	One more since when he said go	sd	4
One more since when he said go	Oh he s got a name	sd	1
One more than when Jeff said go	That was hard	sd	1
That was hard	Thirteen	sd	1
How many do you want to take out	Thirteen	sd	1
Thirteen	Thirteen	sd	1
Thirteen	Thirteen	sd	1
Would you take out six	Why do you pick such stupid numbers	sd	1
Why do you pick such stupid numbers	Anyone can take  out six	sd	1
Anyone can take  out six	It takes skill to take out thirteen	sd	1
It takes skill to take out thirteen	He takes a whole handful of twelve	sd	1
Okay are there more or fewer than when Jeffery said go	Fewer	sd	4
Somebody come write it	Oh can I	sd	1
Jeffery come write it	That s the number they chose	sd	1
That s the number they chose	If you put in two and took   out six	sd	4
The five wants to be a  normal size five	Well I just it s I can t write like that	sd	1
Well I just it s I can t write like that	The thing is straight  up	sd	1
The thing is straight  up	It s weird	sd	1
Do you know how mathematicians read this symbol here	Negative	sd	4
Amy Lynn can you read it	One minus six equals negative five	sd	1
Michelle what would that be	Me	b	1
Me	Hum minus two	sd	4
Romina how would you read   that	Six minus eight equals negative two	sd	1
I would like you to take a turn to  make a problem that will challenge your partner	I made a problem	sd	1
And ask your partner that problem	You don t know mine	sd	1
So we  are gonna come and listen to you	You just don t know the problem I just made up	sd	1
You just don t know the problem I just made up	You don t  know the problem I made up	sd	1
You you can actually just do it with the rods but  you have to make up a problem for your partner and with the  rods and your partner will make one up for you and then  after you ve done that successfully I d like you to try this is  called  try to stump your partner	I know what mine is	sd	1
Are you experimenting	Yeah	b	1
Okay let us know when you ve got a problem	I have a problem already	sd	1
I have a problem already	I have a problem	sd	1
I have a problem	I have a  problem remember it	sd	1
I have a  problem remember it	If a light green um no no	sd	1
If a light green um no no	I have one for you	sd	1
I have one for you	I have one for you too	sd	1
I have one for you too	I have a  problem	sd	1
You going to give it to Alan	I have a problem and Alan has a problem too	sd	1
I want to hear these	If a light green was one third what would be a whole	sd	3
What would be what	If a light green was one third what would be a whole	sd	3
One what would one be	What would one be	sd	3
What would one be	A blue	sd	4
A blue	Yep	b	2
Looks like you were doing it in your heads	I could do it	sd	1
Doing it in your head	This was the problem I was going to give out on the  overhead	sd	1
This was the problem I was going to give out on the  overhead	There  that would if you look down it would equal up to a blue	sd	5
Let s see	Like this	sd	1
So it takes three of them	Now I ve got one for you	sd	1
Let s hear Alan s	If the white one was considered one fifth what would be  considered one	sd	3
If the white one was considered one fifth what would be  considered one	What	ba	1
What	If this was one fifth	sd	3
It s a good one	What would be one	sd	3
What would be one	Yellow	sd	4
Yellow	Right	b	2
Are you going to let him get off that easily	He knows it anyway	sd	1
He knows it anyway	One two	sd	1
Just in case you couldn t remember it in your head you  should always be able to go back and prove it	Umm and also I did I just counted up five	sd	1
Oh	And I know that that s half of   and I know that yellow is half of orange which is ten	sd	5
So you re using  Oh I m sorry	That s okay	ba	1
That s very clever	Should we think of another problem and do it	sd	1
Yeah why not	Ok lets see	sd	1
I have one for you	Okay	b	1
Which rod would one be	That s two	sd	4
That s two	Then one would be red	sd	4
Okay why	Well you see if that s two  this would be a half of it and half of two is one	sd	5
Well you see if that s two  this would be a half of it and half of two is one	And you take another one	sd	1
And you take another one	I have one  for you Alan	sd	1
Okay go ahead	If this is three  what is six	sd	3
If this is three  what is six	If this  is three what is six	sd	3
If this  is three what is six	If that little thing is three what is six	sd	2
If that little thing is three what is six	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	This	sd	1
This	This	sd	1
This	No	b	1
No	No if that if that if that	sd	1
No if that if that if that	If this is three what is six	sd	3
If this is three what is six	If that was considered	sd	1
If that was considered	Hold on I ve got to check	sd	1
Hold on I ve got to check	Three of something	sd	4
Three of something	Oh whoops you were right	sd	2
Oh whoops you were right	Sorry sorry	aa	1
Sorry sorry	All right now	aa	1
All right now	I was thinking it was that	sd	1
I was thinking it was that	Let me bump you off with one	sd	1
Let me bump you off with one	Like you can	sd	1
Like you can	If this  would be considered wait close  your eyes okay if this was consider one half what would be  one	sd	3
If this  would be considered wait close  your eyes okay if this was consider one half what would be  one	Probably what is that purple	aa	4
Probably what is that purple	A brown	sd	4
A brown	Yep I knew it	sd	1
Ok Jackie	Um well we thought it was six twelfths because	sd	4
Jackie I am sorry I cant hear its so loud here	Um we thought is was um six twelfths because there are um twelve  pieces in all and she got six and six makes half	sd	5
What do you think	I have another one	sd	1
Danielle	Um I thought um it would be um two fourths	sd	4
How did you think that	Because if she got a half then the top two rows um is a half and  then that s two fourths	sd	5
Danielle thinks  that another number name for how much of the candy bar we gave  Dr Martino is two fourths so we re interested in knowing how  Danielle was thinking about that	Well this row and this row is a half   and then these are two fourths	sd	4
Can you help the class understand that	Because there s four rows	sd	5
Brian	I just found out another way that a half can be	sd	1
Brian	If I agree	sd	2
If I agree	Ok	b	1
Ok	Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	sd	5
Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	Well  well I agree because there are four thirds on there but but when  there s a half there are only there s three fourths instead of four  thirds	sd	5
Where are your four thirds	Well well well when you said   to split it in half   like that there are only two fourths left over  yeah there are only two fourths when it s a whole there are four  thirds   I can t explain it too well	sd	4
Danielle do you want to go up there and	No I just have something to say	sd	1
No I just have something to say	Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	sd	5
Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	But I thought about it the other way around	sd	2
What do you mean by the other way around um Brian	Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	sd	5
Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	I have another way	sd	2
I have another way	It s I have three I think three sixths	sd	4
Three sixths	Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	sd	5
Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	sd	5
Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	There s one sixth another sixth another sixth another sixth another  sixth another sixth and if you split them in half there s three of  them on top	sd	5
So he is saying that  these two little pieces of candy and these two and these two and  these two and these two and these two I don t know if that is what  you said Brian but something like that	Yeah	b	1
Brian	We did two fourths	sd	4
Nice and loud	We did two fourths	sd	4
Two fourths Do we have another number name for half of the  candy bar	No I was going to say one half	sd	4
Are these all the ones we had	There are six twelfths	sd	4
We said six twelfths two fourths we  said one half Brian	Three sixths	sd	4
The two whites together	Two tenths	sd	4
Michael	One fifth	sd	4
And what other number name can I  call the red one	Two tenths	sd	4
Thank you gentlemen	Okay um we decided we tried the orange and we couldn t we just   we didn t want to make a train	sd	5
Okay um we decided we tried the orange and we couldn t we just   we didn t want to make a train	We wanted to use one color and we  couldn t find any thing to make a quarter of that so we went down to  the blue we couldn t find a half of that then we went down to the  black I mean brown and then we found a half of that and a quarter  for that and so we used brown and we took two purples and we put  those underneath the brown then we took then we found red were  half of purples so we put the reds underneath the purples and then  we had to see how many whites would equal up to all the would  equal up to a brown so we kept putting them on and so we found  eight	sd	5
What is bigger and by how much	James figured that out	sd	2
James figured that out	One eighth	sd	4
Are you convinced what James did	Yes	b	2
Yes	It s one eighth yeah we think its one eighth	sd	4
Okay so James says that in this model one half is bigger than a  quarter or one quarter is bigger than a half	No one half is bigger than one quarter	sd	4
By one eighth	Yeah	b	1
Kelly you disagree	Well me and Jackie have another one	sd	1
I m talking about this one	Oh	b	1
Then we ll hear from some others	Well you said its bigger by an eighth are you calling this an eighth	sd	1
Well you said its bigger by an eighth are you calling this an eighth	Ok Take these two	sd	5
Ok Take these two	This is an eighth it is not bigger  by an eighth because there is still negative spaceYou re calling that  an eighth it s not equal	sd	5
This is an eighth it is not bigger  by an eighth because there is still negative spaceYou re calling that  an eighth it s not equal	But if you take another one it could be  bigger by two eighths  and or it could be bigger by one quarter	sd	5
But if you take another one it could be  bigger by two eighths  and or it could be bigger by one quarter	One  quarter or one um two eighths	sd	5
One  quarter or one um two eighths	It s the only way it could be bigger  by	sd	5
What do you  think about what Meredith is saying	Um	b	1
Um	Well I think we meant that all these put all together are one eighth	sd	4
Well I think we meant that all these put all together are one eighth	I  think that s what we meant	sv	1
I  think that s what we meant	James Yeah	b	1
James Yeah	Both these put together are one eighth	sd	1
Both these put together are one eighth	No	b	2
No	We thought uh all of these whites put together were one eighth	sd	4
We thought uh all of these whites put together were one eighth	That s what we thought	sd	1
That s what we thought	But the question was Is one half bigger is one half bigger than one  quarter	sd	1
But the question was Is one half bigger is one half bigger than one  quarter	And we said one half	sd	2
And we said one half	So you think all these are one eighth	sd	2
So you think all these are one eighth	And that is bigger than 18	sd	2
And that is bigger than 18	The um because that s the question	sd	1
The um because that s the question	The question is is one half  bigger than one quarter right	sd	1
The question is is one half  bigger than one quarter right	Right	b	2
Right	You think its bigger than one eighth and all these are one eighth	sd	2
You think its bigger than one eighth and all these are one eighth	So  that s how much you think its bigger by	sv	2
So  that s how much you think its bigger by	No we I think we got the question wrong	sd	2
What question do you think you were answering uh Miss Jackie  you think you were answering a different question I m hearing you  say	Yeah	b	1
one half bigger than one quarter	That is what we said	sd	1
That is what we said	I think that is where we got a little wolbby	sd	1
Two what	Two eighths	sd	4
Or Meredith suggested another name for that would be	One quarter	aa	4
Tell the  rest of the class who may not have who may have missed it	Well this was one quarter and all these were one quarter and these  two together make up a quarter	sd	5
Ok so you are changing your answer to one quarter or two eighths	Yeah	b	1
Do you think you know  Jessica or not	Umm I am not sure well for that problem	sd	1
Yes	What they mean	sd	1
Yes	Umm well I don t get first they changed first they had an answer  then they changed it and well they didn t yeah they did they  changed it	sd	2
Umm well I don t get first they changed first they had an answer  then they changed it and well they didn t yeah they did they  changed it	And well I m not really sure	sd	1
How many thinking  about the number lines	Wow thats very good	ba	1
Wow thats very good	See  Mrs Phillips	sd	1
I think Michael was first so we will let him go first	Why do you have like you have for your half you have one half and one half	sd	3
Why do you have like you have for your half you have one half and one half	I  am not arguing that	sd	1
I  am not arguing that	But in your third number line you put two thirds as your  half and then two fourths then three fifthsI see the half but it is not exactly the  half way then I think the three fifths are either too small or too big	sd	3
But in your third number line you put two thirds as your  half and then two fourths then three fifthsI see the half but it is not exactly the  half way then I think the three fifths are either too small or too big	The two  fourths are fine	sd	3
The two  fourths are fine	The halves are fine	sd	3
The halves are fine	It is the two thirds and three fifths	sd	3
It is the two thirds and three fifths	Why  are you calling two thirds one half	sd	3
Why  are you calling two thirds one half	Because it is not half	sd	3
Because it is not half	It is bigger than one  half two thirds is bigger than one half	sd	3
It is bigger than one  half two thirds is bigger than one half	We did that once	sd	1
We did that once	I know it	sd	1
I know it	I just didnt know where to put it	sd	1
I just didnt know where to put it	Well this is what the bottom is	sd	5
Well this is what the bottom is	This is one third	sd	5
This is one third	This is two thirds	sd	5
This is two thirds	This area right here is one third	sd	5
This area right here is one third	This area right here is two thirds	sd	5
This area right here is two thirds	This area is three thirds	sd	5
This area is three thirds	You have one third two thirds and then three thirds	sd	2
You have one third two thirds and then three thirds	One third two thirds three thirds	sd	2
One third two thirds three thirds	This is the area in the middle	sd	4
This is the area in the middle	But two thirds is not the area in the middle because two thirds is not equal to  half	sd	5
But two thirds is not the area in the middle because two thirds is not equal to  half	This is two thirds	sd	4
This is two thirds	Then why did you put it there	sd	3
Then why did you put it there	I have	sd	1
I have	Why did you put it right under the half	sd	3
Why did you put it right under the half	See this is the one third area so I put it therethis is the two thirds area  so put it there	sd	4
See this is the one third area so I put it therethis is the two thirds area  so put it there	No Meredith what you did where you think is the one thirds area and you put it  under the line and in the one thirds area	sd	2
No Meredith what you did where you think is the one thirds area and you put it  under the line and in the one thirds area	It does not make sense	sd	3
It does not make sense	Which one is it	sd	3
Which one is it	It is the bottom one	sd	4
It is the bottom one	Then why did you put it in the area	sd	3
Then why did you put it in the area	Because I wanted to show the one thirds two thirds and three thirds area	sd	5
Because I wanted to show the one thirds two thirds and three thirds area	Yeah but they are in the wrong space	sd	5
Yeah but they are in the wrong space	If you wanted to do that you should put it  in the exact space or at least approximate	sd	5
Well I think her spaces are here Erik	Yeah	b	1
What I am hearing her say is pretend you dont see these	Oh I get it	sd	1
Oh I get it	She is just labeling the spaces like one third of a space and that is  two thirds and three thirds	sd	2
What do you think Amy	Ohm	sd	1
Thank you Meredith	My question was why didnt she just make one big one and not make like five	sd	3
My question was why didnt she just make one big one and not make like five	It just doesnt make sense because you do not need  to have  them there and a lot of people will think that they are the numbers and it is  confusing	sd	3
Do you have any trouble   with that	No	b	1
It that what you did Meredith	Yes	b	1
That is what I imagined you did	She is making smaller parts of it	sd	2
Why do you think she is doing that	It is just easier to see when making the whole number line  over	sd	4
It is just easier to see when making the whole number line  over	It is just easier to see	sd	4
Can you see  that	Yes	b	1
I got the feeling that the second one you were showing halves and the third  number line what were you trying to show	Thirds	sd	4
And the fourth one	Fourths	aa	4
The fifth one	Fifths	aa	4
She was focusing on showing different pieces of it	One third	sd	4
One third	Because it would take three of the red ones to make um one of  the green ones	sd	5
Because it would take three of the red ones to make um one of  the green ones	Oh I can convince you that it s possible	sd	1
Oh I can convince you that it s possible	It s possible because there s white and two whites equal one red	sd	5
It s possible because there s white and two whites equal one red	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
No	Not now	sd	1
Not now	Not if the dark green is one	sd	5
Not if the dark green is one	Because if youre comparing the red to  dark green it cant be one	sd	5
Because if youre comparing the red to  dark green it cant be one	But if youre comparing the red to  something else it can be a one it can be a whole	sd	5
But if youre comparing the red to  something else it can be a one it can be a whole	But if you are  comparing it to something bigger though	sd	1
But if you are  comparing it to something bigger though	Well red can t be a whole red can t be one because the green is  bigger and it takes three of the reds to make one green	sd	5
Well red can t be a whole red can t be one because the green is  bigger and it takes three of the reds to make one green	Three wholes	sd	4
Three wholes	Can t give it a name because it can t be put into into two	sd	4
Can t give it a name because it can t be put into into two	Because  look	sd	1
Because  look	But the dark green is bigger then that	sd	4
But the dark green is bigger then that	Three wh three wholes	sd	4
Three wh three wholes	Because if this is a one	sd	4
Because if this is a one	It would be three wholes	sd	5
It would be three wholes	Because if this is a one	sd	5
Because if this is a one	It takes three to figure this out	sd	4
It takes three to figure this out	And if all the reds are one	sd	4
And if all the reds are one	And there are three that ll be three wholes	sd	4
And there are three that ll be three wholes	Umm	sd	1
Umm	Umm yes I guess so	sd	1
Umm yes I guess so	Three wholes	sd	4
Three wholes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Three wholes	sd	4
Three wholes	Three wholes	sd	4
Three wholes	I know	aa	1
I know	I know why	b	1
I know why	Okay because the the	sd	1
Okay because the the	Okay if the red one is considered one  then the green one is a lot bigger	sd	5
Okay if the red one is considered one  then the green one is a lot bigger	So it would have to  be it would take three whole ones to make another green so it  should be considered three wholes	sd	5
So it would have to  be it would take three whole ones to make another green so it  should be considered three wholes	Well I think well if you if you say that this would be one	sd	5
Well I think well if you if you say that this would be one	This is one and it takes three  of the one the one wholes to equal up one of these	sd	5
This is one and it takes three  of the one the one wholes to equal up one of these	And it that s one whole umm one  whole plus one whole plus one whole would equal three wholes	sd	5
And it that s one whole umm one  whole plus one whole plus one whole would equal three wholes	So  the green would have to be three wholes	sd	5
So  the green would have to be three wholes	Well I thought the same thing because the dark green wait	sd	5
Well I thought the same thing because the dark green wait	If red  is one that would be one whole	sd	5
If red  is one that would be one whole	Then the green would have to be  ah two more wholes so that would be three wholes	sd	5
Then the green would have to be  ah two more wholes so that would be three wholes	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Mmm hmm	We were looking at the circumference and area of the circle and the difference	sd	4
We were looking at the circumference and area of the circle and the difference	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We talked about the area is length times width and perimeter is length plus width plus length plus width	sd	4
We talked about the area is length times width and perimeter is length plus width plus length plus width	a triangle	sd	4
a triangle	I mean  I mean the rectangle	sd	4
I mean  I mean the rectangle	Well the area is whats inside and the perimeter is whats outside	sd	4
Well the area is whats inside and the perimeter is whats outside	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Joey	b	1
Joey	Hes getting the perimeter of the circle	sd	4
Hes getting the perimeter of the circle	Alex he shaded in the middle of the square  cause its the area	sd	2
Alex he shaded in the middle of the square  cause its the area	He outlined the circle with the perimeter	sd	2
He outlined the circle with the perimeter	Yeah	b	1
And the heading	Is that a microphone Miss	sd	1
Twelve each please	Miss	sd	1
Miss	Yeah	aa	1
Six in each would be	Fourteen	sd	4
One to one	Eight in one group and four in the other	sd	4
Which group	In the two	sd	4
No	Three	sd	4
Okay	How did you get two piles of eight	sd	3
How many blocks have you got	Three	sd	4
Three	Twelve	sd	2
Follow that	Yeah	b	1
If youve used eight to three you should have eight empty boxes on your	Left	sd	4
Left hand side and three empty boxes on your right hand side which means you have used	Eleven	sd	4
Eleven	Eleven	sd	2
Money now	Money	sd	1
Ashley	Fifty dollars	sd	4
One to three is 50 to 150	Four shares is equal	sd	4
How many blocks required	Seven	sd	4
You dont need a calculator to do that	You told me to get it out Miss	sd	1
How would you find 30	Seven divided by	sd	4
Seven divided by	Three	sd	2
Write that down	Write what down	sd	1
A number for this share and a number for that share dont you	Yeah	b	1
Is one share six and the answer to that would be yes	So the eight would be	sd	4
Nicole	Yes	b	1
So what would the ratio eight to three be	Eighteen	sd	4
Do you follow whats going on	Fortyeight	sd	4
Fortyeight	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Fortyeight to 18	sd	2
Bobbie Jo	Easily divisible by	sd	4
So try to maintain that relationship where the total number of boxes	need a	sd	1
You can have a ratio of 25 to one if you want or	Forty a hundred to one	sd	4
Do you have to restrict yourself to dollars	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
Kilometers liters	He got eight	sd	4
Have you finished doing your friends question yet	No	b	1
Do you want a hand	All right	aa	1
Okay	Yeah we both wrote	sd	2
Yeah we both wrote	She had  because I did 121 divided by 65	sd	2
You shouldnt really use the division sign like that because youre not dividing by youre dividing in	Eightyone	sd	4
Eightyone	How do you	qy	1
In your head though not with your calculator not with	I was just doing	sd	1
What do you have to do	She had to	sd	1
Four is 25	Twentyfive	sd	4
Because 408 divided by 204 is only two so it should be 400 to eight	eight	sd	1
eight	Miss is that	sd	1
Turn around	What do we do when	sd	1
Nicole	Because you only need certain	sd	1
Because you only need certain	Because	sd	1
Thanks	Because you might only like a certain color	sd	5
How is that going to make a story that says divide 210 Smarties into the ratio two to five	One person might want color and one wants the other color	sd	5
One person might want color and one wants the other color	And theres more of one color like the blue ones theres heaps of those and the brown no and then theres a color  red	sd	5
Bobbie Jo	Theres seven people	sd	4
Lindsey	A	b	4
A	A	b	2
A	Um  to what person B	sd	2
So I had some Smarties and person A stole some	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Person B stole some from person A	sd	4
Person B stole some from person A	Person B pays	sd	2
Not Smarties this time something else	Marbles	aa	1
Marbles surfboards	I think Smarties	sd	1
Bodyboards	Ah Skittles	sd	1
We have 210 bodyboards and we want them divided in the ratio two to five	Eight	aa	4
What is it	No she said she said ones a pro surfboard ones just a beginner	sd	1
Bodyboards	In a shop	sd	1
In a shop	On the shore	sd	1
A or B	B	b	4
B	A	b	2
A would be the amateur and they get how many boards would they have got	Thirty	ba	4
Six boards and 15	You wouldnt even need you just need one	sd	1
But make a ratio and a quantity and write down a story for that question	I didnt get to work my ratio out Miss	sd	3
All right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	There were 11 boxes and 77 apples	sd	4
There were 11 boxes and 77 apples	Three were  and eight	sd	4
Yeah	That would	sd	1
How many went to market	Three	sd	4
Three	What happened to my story	sd	1
Isnt that right	Well I said that	sd	1
But you dont need to tell that in the story because thats what the person has to work out	Seventyseven apples	sd	4
That would be why they would divide it in a different ratio	Jessica needs help Miss	sd	1
Listening to Teague	No Jessica needs help first	sd	1
No Jessica needs help first	story makes sense	sd	1
story makes sense	No	b	1
Why not	Because they thought they already had stories but then they read mine and realized they didnt	sd	1
So you have a good story that you can	No its not good	sd	1
No its not good	It is	aa	1
All right	Ill read it for her	sd	1
Okay	Okay two basketball players were comparing how many points they had in their NBL careers	sd	5
Okay two basketball players were comparing how many points they had in their NBL careers	They had a ratio of one to one	sd	5
Shh Katie	They jointly scored five thousand fiftyfive	sd	4
Come on now please	Two basketball players were comparing how many plays they had in their NBL career	sd	5
Two basketball players were comparing how many plays they had in their NBL career	They had a ratio of one to one	sd	5
They had a ratio of one to one	They both scored five fiftyfive thousand six hundred fortynine points	sd	5
They both scored five fiftyfive thousand six hundred fortynine points	Together they equaled	sd	5
Together they equaled	One hundred and eleven thousand two hundred and ninetyeight	sd	2
Yeah so thats a good story but wheres the actual question if you were going to make it into a question for someone to do	My question was um one to one equals I mean one for the ratio of one equals 111298	sd	5
So really your question would have boiled down to divide 111000 in the ratio one to one	Yeah	b	1
Danny	I havent finished Miss	sd	1
All right well Ill give you	either	sd	1
Well you lets just go with what youve got then eh	What to say the story	sd	1
Yep	We didnt have a story	sd	1
We didnt have a story	Its just like	sd	1
Thatll be fine	One to four	sd	4
Yeah	person how much	sd	1
person how much	Emma has one blue candle and Laura has four red candles	sd	4
Emma has one blue candle and Laura has four red candles	Thats my story	sd	1
Danny	Yes	b	1
Read me what you have please	There was 30 lollies	sd	5
There was 30 lollies	One man got 10 lollies the other got 20 therefore the ratio was 10 to 20	sd	5
Anybody else got a good story	There is a Mars Bar competition and you can win a free Mars Bar	sd	5
There is a Mars Bar competition and you can win a free Mars Bar	Um five in six are losers and the shop has 121 Mars Bars how many Mars Bars are losers	sd	5
Did you understand the question Colin	Yep	b	1
However do you actually think the Mars Bar company would have a ratio of five to six of winners and losers	No	b	1
No	Um five are the losers and then the last one	sd	4
Is that likely	Probably not	sd	1
Lets do winners first to losers	Give me a pen	sd	1
Give me a pen	One to 10	sd	4
Emma	One to six	sd	4
One to six	One to five	sd	4
One to five	Two to 10	sd	4
Same thing isnt it	On that on that ad thing they have one to six	sd	4
On the on the ad	Or was it four	sd	4
Or was it four	That was one to six	sd	2
That was one to six	That was one to three	sd	2
That was one to three	It used to be	sd	1
So theres a is there an ad	Yeah	b	1
From the Mars Bar company that says that theyre going to	Something might	sd	1
You found 30 and multiplied by two and got	Sixty	b	4
Sixty and so what is the second share worth	A hundred and fifty	sd	4
Do you prefer the unitary method or the fraction method	Unitary method	sd	4
Okay	Yeah that one	aa	4
Michelle	The top one	sd	4
Who else	Was it Daniel was it you I was asking	sd	1
No	Unitary or fraction	sd	4
Exercise tenofour	When are we doing this	sd	1
Can you share with him please	All right then	sd	1
What are you doing	brought me lunch	sd	1
Can you make sure that you are  good person	Yes	b	1
It will take you that long to do if youre quiet	Do we have to write out the question Miss	sd	1
No	Do we do every every question	sd	1
Its ratio would be	Right	b	1
Right	Thats the ratio	sd	4
Thats the ratio	This ones 10 to six	sd	2
He was away yesterday too wasnt he	Whos got	sd	1
You	Me	b	1
Me	Yeah I told her you	sd	1
Instead of slash we use dotdot	Oh he told me to use the slash	sd	1
Lets say you move back a little bit so youre out of reach	So you dont	sd	1
Thats right	Id have to do	sd	1
Id have to do	And no	sd	1
Four of them	Four of them	sd	1
Which question is it	Four twenty	sd	1
Four twenty	Divide 420 in the ratio of seven to one	sd	1
One share	Thirtyfour	aa	4
How did you work that out	Four twenty divided by 12	sd	4
Four twenty divided by 12	Thirtyfive	b	2
One share equals 35 so then youd have to just do seven times 35 and five times 35	Three fortyfive	sd	4
Three fortyfive	They got the answer	sd	1
You right now then	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How come you have to get that microphone	sd	1
So they can listen to me talking to you	So they cant hear us but they can hear you	sd	1
Yes	How can I use this to bribe my mom to get me some Smarties	sd	1
All right	Ill need Ill need a few	sd	1
You cant eat the Smarties	Oh	b	1
Okay you make a prediction first	My prediction is 12	sd	4
How many	I said my prediction is 12 and you got to	sd	4
I said my prediction is 12 and you got to	Its twelve	sd	2
And you write two in the frequency	Ive got lots of blues	sd	1
Ive got lots of blues	Ive got five	sd	1
Who	You got 51	sd	4
You got 51	No	b	2
Itll be easier wont it	and just makes it even	sd	4
and just makes it even	Okay now you can  Miss	sd	1
Well the blue equals none brown is one red is three	Are we done  now Miss	sd	1
Id like it complete	What do you have to complete	sd	1
What do you have to complete	Just the	sd	1
Tallys the working column and frequencys the answer	Everything Miss	sd	1
Everything Miss	Oh Im hungry	sd	1
But we dont really need a work column so	Look at these theyre very tempting	sd	1
Look at these theyre very tempting	And now Ive got to	sd	1
Yes I think so	Miss can we eat this after we just calculate the frequency	sd	1
Hes got 13	What does it mean by frequency	sd	3
Frequency means how many	How do you work out percentage	sd	3
That would be two out of six which is a third	Its thirtythree point three three	sd	4
How many did you have Jessica	Thirteen	sd	4
Thirteen	Twelve	sd	4
Anybody have 14	I had 13	sd	4
Especially if youve got 13 because its an awkward number	Do you have to write down three over six times 100	sd	4
No the tally is the working column for the frequency	What if you have zero	sd	3
I already know a third is 33 and a third	How would you work out like to continue working without a	sd	1
How are you going to continue working without a biro	Im not going to  my calculator	sd	1
Did you happen to remember a calculator today	Its broken	sd	1
What for	I didnt have any blues any browns one green	sd	4
No that cant be right	No oranges four pinks	sd	4
Like pink yeah orange and black equal	Do you know any	sd	1
Eightthirds	Good choice	sd	1
What	Ive got 21 six seven	sd	4
Did you when you add them up make it six repeater and three repeater or just six and three	Just six and three	sd	4
Oh then thats where you probably youve got a	I got  left  ninenine	sd	4
Is that a three or an eight	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Eight point three	sd	4

What power is that	The third power	sd	4
Lubo	Eight to the tenth power	sd	4
What power is it	The tenth power	sd	4
Martin	Minus 11	sd	4
And how did you calculate it	Two to the second power minus three times five equals 15	sd	5
And why didnt you calculate two squared which is four minus three equals one times five	Because first I figured out the power and then I multiplied it	sd	5
All of you have one	No were missing one	sd	1
Okay I Do you boys each have one	No	b	1
You will do A B C D E F H G	I already have G	sd	1
Youll do B and you will do C	I have the letter A	sd	1
Come up here Paul take your work with you	Im not sure if I have it correct	sd	1
Thats why were in school to learn	May I go up to write the next one	sd	1
You may and do you have the same one as Paul is doing	Im doing	sd	1
Be careful so	Teacher may I do the letter H	sd	1
You want to do the letter A	The letter H	sd	1
You cant go up anymore but you may check the work	Teacher so I can go up	sd	1
Which assignment do you have	Letter B	sd	1
So who has done the letter A	Me	b	1
Lucka is not finished yet	I will do letter A	sd	1
Excuse me	I just have the last two assignments remaining	sd	1
Who has the letter C	Who has an A	sd	1
I did not assign the letter F to anyone	I have that one	sd	1
Excuse me	Im doing that one	sd	1
Which problem do you have	Letter A	sd	1
Write it up on the board	Im done	sd	1
Write it on the board	Im done	sd	1
Now Denisa will go up to the board	I have the letter C	sd	1
Okay	I have done the letter C as well	sd	1
From which two numbers did she come up with 16	Four plus 12	sd	2
Correct from what two numbers did she get the result	Number four and number seven	sd	2
What is the last calculating performance	Subtraction	aa	4
Subtraction no addition and from what two numbers	From 12 and four	sd	4
I cant see it	Its incorrect	sd	4
What is the correct answer	Minus eight	sd	4
Okay and number four what is the last calculating performance	Multiplication	aa	4
I cant hear you	Multiplication	aa	4
Multiplication good and what two numerators	Four	aa	4
Calculate whats in the parenthesis	Two squared is four and four minus three is one	sd	5
Go ahead	Its seven	sd	5
Its seven	Nine minus two	sd	5
Lukas	Nine minus four	sd	4
Excuse me	Nine minus four	sd	4
Next number three	Three minus four minus one	sd	5
Dennis	One	sd	4
Once again I want to know which two numbers are calculated Go ahead Jana	Nine plus ten	sd	4
What is that	Fourteen times two	sd	4
Number three is	Nine minus 10	sd	4
Number four is	Four times two	sd	4
Letter D	Sixteen minus five	sd	4
Dennis	Sixteen minus five	sd	4
Good	Sixteen minus 25	sd	4
Good Paul and the answer is	Minus nine	sd	4
Number three Paul	Four minus 25 equals minus 21	sd	5
Number four	Me	sd	1
You may	Four minus five equals one squared	sd	5
Okay but four minus five does not equal one	Minus one	sd	4
Isnt it negative one	Its	sd	1
The problem in letter D	Yes	b	1
Two minus 21 equals negative	Negative 19	sd	4
Next is letter E	Fifteen minus 36	sd	4
Fifteen minus 36 equals	Negative 21	sd	4
Number two	Fifteen minus 18	sd	4
Excuse me	Negative three	sd	4
Number three is	Fifteen minus 12	sd	4
Fine and number four	Fifteen minus six	sd	4
Problem number one	One plus four minus 25	sd	4
Minus 25 equals	Negative 20	sd	4
Number two	One plus four minus five equals zero	sd	5
Number three	Negative one minus four minus five equals negative 10	sd	5
Correct	And one minus four plus five equals	sd	5
And one minus four plus five equals	Plus two	sd	2
How about the problems in letter G	Ten minus 12	sd	4
Go ahead Jana	Ten minus 12 equals negative two	sd	5
Correct and do number two as well Jana	Seven times four equals 28	sd	5
Yes and Paul will try number three	Number three	sd	1
Yes	Sixtyfive minus three is	sd	4
Martin is helping him out so why dont you tell us since you know it	Okay so first we calculate the power of a number	sd	4
The root of the number yes	The root of the number	sd	1
How about number four	Ten minus 36	sd	4
Ten minus youre already doing the next one in that case go ahead Denisa give it a try	The square root of 100 is 10 minus three times two is six squared equals 36	sd	5
The square root of 100 is 10 minus three times two is six squared equals 36	So the answer is negative 36	sd	5
Why dont you try the first one Paul	Me	sd	1
Yes	So the square root of 25 is so its five two squared is four five minus four is one	sd	5
Multiplication	Five times four is 20 and 30 minus 20 is 10	sd	5
Jarka will try the next one	Parenthesis 30 minus the square root of 25 is five so 30 minus five is 25 times four equals 100	sd	5
Lubo will try number three	Thirty minus 20 equals 10 squared which is 20	sd	5
Thirty minus 20 equals 10 squared which is 20	Twenty times two is 40	sd	5
Mike Brizek has not been here in class for a while so hes just reviewing the work	10 squared is 100 30 minus 100 is minus 70 times two equals negative 140	sd	1
I see	Negative 145	sd	4
Negative 145	Negative	sd	4
Why does it say 100 it does say negative 100 but why does it say 145 on the board	Because someone wrote it up there	sd	1
Excuse me	A raised to the fifth power	sd	4
That was letter C and B	Negative four to the third power	sd	4
Go ahead Jana	Parenthesis	aa	4
What are we going to call it	Negative four to the third power as a whole number	sd	4
Negative four Nicole	Negative four to the third power	sd	4
Eight excellent	One thousand	sd	4
Yes	Zero	sd	4
Very good	Thirtysix	sd	4
One hundredth	One hundredth	sd	1
Hundredth	Zero point	sd	4
Eight	To the thousandths	sd	4
Correct	Zero point thousandths	sd	4
Everyone else should be quiet Lukas will tell us	One ten thousandths	sd	4
And the second to last problem	To the nearest thousandths	sd	4
And the last one is	Zero point four to the ten thousandths	sd	4
Jarka	Zero point four to the ten thousandths	sd	4
Paul	Negative 25	sd	4
Rosta	Negative 125	sd	4
Next problem	Negative one	sd	4
The fifth power	The fifth power	sd	1
The fifth power and the last one Paul	Positive one	sd	4
Positive one because its	Sixth power	sd	4
Fine and Paul has already said that it will be	Two A cubed	sd	4
We have X cubed which is once again a volume of a cube but we also have Y squared which is not a volume of a cube but its what	Square	b	4
So Jana what can we sum up	What page are we on	sd	1
Someone else may try it as well	The cubed numbers may be added	sd	4
The cubed numbers may be added up	And the squared numbers	sd	4
Please read this part for me	We can only add and subtract powers with the same base and exponent	sd	1
Denisa	Two A plus three A to the second power	sd	5
And what is it or why is it that we cant add them together	Because A is a side and A squared is the area of the cube face	sd	5
Marcela please read the one we cant add up	Yes five X minus four Y cant be calculated	sd	4
Was there enough for you guys back there	No	b	1
Place it on your desk	Im done	sd	1
Good	I cant figure it out	sd	3
This is five cubed plus three cubed equals	Eight	sd	4
Good is it working out for you Paul	Yes Im done	sd	1
Why dont you start Lubo	Three X cubed	sd	4
Three X cubed	Eight X cubed	sd	2
Paul	Three X squared	sd	4
Three X squared	Four X squared	aa	2
Marcela	Ten X to the fifth power	sd	4
Paul	Four A to the fourth power	sd	4
Marcela	Six A to the fourth power	sd	4
Lubo	Negative one A to the fourth power	sd	4
Jana	Negative Y squared	sd	4
Teresa	Negative one Y to the fourth power	sd	4
Negative one Y to the fourth power	No no	ba	2
Lukas	That one cant be solved	sd	4
Why is that	There are two different exponents	sd	5
Now hell try to explain what exactly are we going to do with this problem	Well use either subtraction or addition depending on the circle	sd	4
Very good so give it a try so we know how to do it	Well plus three X squared well subtract it from negative two	sd	4
I think Martin we should start with	X squared which is in the middle	sd	4
Yes thats two X squared and what else	Six X squared	sd	4
Good six X squared minus	Is one X squared	sd	4
Lets try another one	Two A cubed	sd	4
Yes	Three A cubed	sd	4
Yes	Eight A cubed one A cubed	sd	4
Sit up or youll have crookback	Really	aa	1
Yes	We have to do the entire page	sd	1
Do you need anything	No nothing at this time	sv	1
Fine	Can this be for an example three plus one	sd	1
Its zero times A to the fifth power which is	Zero	sd	4
Yes	Should I continue here	sd	1
Done very good	The entire page	sd	1
Excuse me	We have to figure out C and D	sd	1
We have to figure out C and D	Are we doing the entire page	sd	1
Yes youre doing the entire page	The results	sd	1
Yes you may	Your work is easy	sd	1
five to the fourth power	Okay	b	1
And it is five C to the fourth power isnt it	Well yes	b	1
You have negative here so youre going to find five C to the fourth power over here	Fine	sd	1
Youve scratched this out because its not correct yes	That was already crossed out	sd	1
Yes	Three	sd	4
Yes	Is that correct	sd	1
This may not be correct	Im satisfied with it	sd	1
Are you sure	If I have a problem for example zero A to the fifth power is that zero	sd	2
Yes	But I can write zero A to the fifth power	sd	4
The previous formula is a partial answer	Would it be wrong if it said	sd	1
Would it be wrong if it said	Do we have to do these along the sides as well	sd	1
Do we have to do these along the sides as well	A squared zero A squared	sd	4
A squared zero A squared	Is that incorrect	sd	1
Yes	If it says zero A squared is that zero	sd	4
Yes because zero times A squared is	Zero	sd	4
Yes	Teacher what am I supposed to do here	sd	3
And where you see the numbers incorrect you just cross it out	So I should do it like	sd	1
May I help you	Im done with my work	sd	1
Excellent and did you finish this part as well	No	b	1
Why dont you take a look at it than	These were assigned to us as well	sd	1
Its not calculated here	How do you calculate this do I just write out the results	sd	1
Denisa is back there already so lets see	Where am I going	sd	1
Is there anyone I did not call up	Me	b	1
You have what	A and B	sd	1
Okay one of you will go with the girls and the other one will go here okay	I should go with Verka	sd	1
Youre supposed to compare the answers and if your results come out different discuss it okay	This over here is incorrect	sd	4
This over here is incorrect	That should be zero	sd	4
Which one did you work on	Im done	sd	1
Im done	I had only one incorrect problem	sd	1
Petra Paul come here	I have everything correct	sd	1
Okay I would like to know how did you come up with number five	Because we substituted X with one and one minus one equals zero	sd	5
Because we substituted X with one and one minus one equals zero	So X A cubed equals zero	sd	5
Would that answer work or is zero a more accurate answer	It can be used as well	sd	4
If you calculate zero times X cubed the answer is zero	Zero	sd	1
Paul which one were you having a hard time with so we can discuss it	Well I was having some difficulty with the last one	sd	3
Well I was having some difficulty with the last one	The last one	sd	1
You did not read it accurately	Okay I see	b	1
Lucko how many problems did you calculate on your own	All of them	sd	4
All the problems and youre satisfied with the results	Yes	b	1
So you had some problems in the beginning	When I figured out the formula it got easy after that	sd	1
How are you doing over here	Weve discussed all the problems	sd	1
Were you having any difficulty	No	b	1
Fine	Negative C to the fourth power	sd	4
Negative C to the fourth power	Negative C to the fourth power	sd	2
You did check the rest of your work yes	Yes	b	1
Yes Im listening	May I go to the restroom	sd	1
Go ahead	Five X cubed plus X minus X	sd	5
Five X cubed plus X minus X	Is that possible to calculate it	sd	2
Positive X minus X equals to	X X zero X	sd	4
Zero and the only thing remaining will be the grand total of	I was right do you see	aa	1
Im listening	I have it calculated  two plus two is four plus four is eight eight plus eight is 16	sd	5
I have it calculated  two plus two is four plus four is eight eight plus eight is 16	and from 16 I got 66176	sd	5
And did you calculate it in dollars	No I didnt because I did not want to add it up	sd	5
Yes	Power numbers	sd	4
Power of what number	The power of one and two	sd	4
The power of one and two	To the second power	sd	2
So number two is to the first power four is	Two squared	sd	4
I mean number eight is	Two cubed	b	4
So these numbers are exponents	Exponents	sd	1
Due to our current situation students will not be allowed to go out during the break	Great	ba	1
Which you just did in class okay	Why didnt you assign number seven	sd	1
Did you write down your homework assignments	Yes I did	sd	1
Thats right	Thats right	aa	4
Whats  whats your reasoning	I dont think that you can do that because if  you put two yellows thatd be too big but  then if you put two purples thats uh thats  uh thatd be too short and	sv	5
I dont think that you can do that because if  you put two yellows thatd be too big but  then if you put two purples thats uh thats  uh thatd be too short and	I dont think there is anything	sd	5
Can you show us  your yellow and your purple	Well I was thinking	sd	1
Well I was thinking	Cause theres usually  the tall one	sd	5
Cause theres usually  the tall one	All right	aa	1
All right	You see  usually um they are only one with the  shorter one only one block apart	sd	5
You see  usually um they are only one with the  shorter one only one block apart	Like that  and so these but then if you have for the  blues like if you have two yellows it would  be too tall and if you have two purples	sd	5
Like that  and so these but then if you have for the  blues like if you have two yellows it would  be too tall and if you have two purples	Thatd be too short and then theres really  nothing in between  cause if you do	sd	5
Thatd be too short and then theres really  nothing in between  cause if you do	And then here theres nothing  in between right here so theres no way  that you can do that	sd	5
And then here theres nothing  in between right here so theres no way  that you can do that	But if you put three greens to it you could	sd	2
But if you put three greens to it you could	Yeah but Erik said Erik wants the half	sd	2
Yeah but Erik said Erik wants the half	cause I figured that out too	sd	1
cause I figured that out too	I think you could do it but theyre   See I  figure if you take a yellow and a purple its  equal	sv	5
I think you could do it but theyre   See I  figure if you take a yellow and a purple its  equal	Theyre  not exactly the same but theyre both  halves	sd	5
Theyre  not exactly the same but theyre both  halves	Because the purple would be half of  this even though the yellow is bigger  because if you put the purple on the bottom  and the yellow on top its equal so theyre  both halves but only ones bigger than the  other	sd	5
Because the purple would be half of  this even though the yellow is bigger  because if you put the purple on the bottom  and the yellow on top its equal so theyre  both halves but only ones bigger than the  other	So it equals up to the same thing	sd	5
So it equals up to the same thing	If this would be one whole  you could take the yellow to be and you  could call it one half	sd	5
If this would be one whole  you could take the yellow to be and you  could call it one half	But if you took another  yellow it would be too big	sd	5
But if you took another  yellow it would be too big	But if you took a  purple with the yellow and put it on top of  yellow it equaled to the blue	sd	5
But if you took a  purple with the yellow and put it on top of  yellow it equaled to the blue	So the purple  would be a half and the yellow would be a  half except that the yellow would just be  one bigger than the other	sd	5
So the purple  would be a half and the yellow would be a  half except that the yellow would just be  one bigger than the other	Or maybe you  could call this three quarters and you could call this one  quarter	sv	5
Or maybe you  could call this three quarters and you could call this one  quarter	And but it  would still equal up to the whole	sd	5
And but it  would still equal up to the whole	I didnt think of that	sv	1
I didnt think of that	Like that	sd	1
Like that	Cause I was  thinking that um that you would need the  same	sd	4
Cause I was  thinking that um that you would need the  same	You dont really	sd	2
You dont really	air	sd	1
air	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Well well I mean	sd	1
Well well I mean	Yes cause the pink is the purple is smaller  than the yellow and the person who got the  purple wouldnt have as much	sd	5
Yes cause the pink is the purple is smaller  than the yellow and the person who got the  purple wouldnt have as much	Yeah but you could call this three quarters  and this one quarter and it would still be  equal up to the whole	sd	5
Yeah but you could call this three quarters  and this one quarter and it would still be  equal up to the whole	Then it just wouldnt  be halves it would be quarters	sd	5
Then it just wouldnt  be halves it would be quarters	But it would  still look like youre dividing it into halves  but youre really dividing into quarters	sd	5
But it would  still look like youre dividing it into halves  but youre really dividing into quarters	Well you could you could use say if there if  there was three people   you could at least  split it into thirds you could at least split it  into thirds	sv	5
Well you could you could use say if there if  there was three people   you could at least  split it into thirds you could at least split it  into thirds	Its not	sd	4
Its not	You see were trying to do  it in halves	sd	4
You see were trying to do  it in halves	Oh	b	1
Oh	When youre dividing things into halves  both halves have to be equal   in order to be  considered a half	sd	5
When youre dividing things into halves  both halves have to be equal   in order to be  considered a half	this isnt a half	sd	2
this isnt a half	Those two arent  both even halves	sd	2
Those two arent  both even halves	Yeah	aa	1
Yeah	Well see	ba	1
Well see	This isnt exactly dividing into halves	sd	4
This isnt exactly dividing into halves	But Im still using two blocks but  not  Im dividing it in half still using two  blocks but one block is bigger than the  other block	sd	5
But Im still using two blocks but  not  Im dividing it in half still using two  blocks but one block is bigger than the  other block	So its like using three quarters  and one quarter but youre only using two  blocks so its almost like dividing it in half	sd	5
So its like using three quarters  and one quarter but youre only using two  blocks so its almost like dividing it in half	Well if hes saying hes saying that he wants  a half but if he puts that a purple and a  yellow he wont have a half	sd	5
Well if hes saying hes saying that he wants  a half but if he puts that a purple and a  yellow he wont have a half	He would have  three quarters and one quarter	sd	5
He would have  three quarters and one quarter	And he  wants a half	sd	5
And he  wants a half	Um	b	1
Um	You cant if youre div you cant divide  that into halves because youd have to use  rods that are of different sizes but you  could divide it into thirds using rods that are  the same size which which is the light green  rods	sd	5
You cant if youre div you cant divide  that into halves because youd have to use  rods that are of different sizes but you  could divide it into thirds using rods that are  the same size which which is the light green  rods	But I didnt want thirds	sd	2
But I didnt want thirds	I  think that some of these that you cant do  like this would be odd	sv	5
I  think that some of these that you cant do  like this would be odd	this could be even	sd	5
this could be even	This would be odd	sd	5
This would be odd	Be  even	sd	5
Be  even	This be you  see then when you get up to here blue  would be odd but like with brown you  could take these two	sd	5
This be you  see then when you get up to here blue  would be odd but like with brown you  could take these two	and put them  together and that would be even	sd	5
and put them  together and that would be even	Take the  orange put the yellows with the orange and  that would be even	sd	5
Take the  orange put the yellows with the orange and  that would be even	No	sd	2
No	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah yeah	b	1
Yeah yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And  I think one more time as a summary because  youre saying that purple could not be  considered one half because one of the  conditions isnt met right	sd	5
And  I think one more time as a summary because  youre saying that purple could not be  considered one half because one of the  conditions isnt met right	I mean theyre  both the same size	sd	5
I mean theyre  both the same size	But they dont um if you put like  that	sd	5
But they dont um if you put like  that	they dont uh theyre not as big as the blue	sd	5
Do you remember what you were trying to find some numbers what did those numbers do	The numbers replaced like the empty boxes or triangles	sd	4
Um what s the secret to that	It s one big secret	sd	1
Matt	That the the two multiple the two num the numbers have to like when you add them up it has to equal it has to equal the number to the to the left and be multiples of the number to the right	sd	5
Well you might not really mean multiples when you multiply them	Yeah be able to multiply them	sd	4
Jeff what was special about them	Cause there were two prime numbers in it so it was like impossible	sd	5
Cause there were two prime numbers in it so it was like impossible	No	b	2
No	or you had to go into decimals or whatever	sd	4
Right and what did we do then Stephanie what did we do	Well we had to put a number in the box and a number in the triangle so that the equation was true	sd	5
Uh you remember what you wrote on your paper	No	b	1
Well you suppose you can get it if you wrote small do you suppose you could get it up by the table the way you did it on your paper	Up here	sd	1
And you left out one parenthesis do you see where you left it out	oh	b	1
oh	Should I do more	sd	1
Well that s probably enough but she went down and did that and you agree that that s what we were doing	Yeah	b	1
Michelle	We tried to find a secret to it with a pattern like how the numbers	sd	4
Okay and some of you did find a very interesting secret and it might be an appropriate one to share um no Ankur says that we shouldn t do that	Yes we should	sd	1
Ask that each group leader has  the very first question when you get to your group  The  things that you re going to be working with today could you  just tell me what you have on your desk that you re working  with Devon	Um we have blocks and rocks	sd	1
Students you may start okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	David has 14 Legos	sd	1
David has 14 Legos		b	1
	Paul has 5 Legos	sd	1
And  Michael and Michelle what is it that you re doing	Eight eight s  the	sd	4
How many do you  have	Fifteen	sd	4
Fifteen	Okay nine	b	2
Okay nine	Eight	sd	2

It has to be eight	No it s not	sd	2
No it s not	It isn t eight	sd	4
It isn t eight	Yes it is	sd	2

How did  you figure that out	Jamie	sd	1
Jamie	You were supposed to go over the directions	sd	1
You were supposed to go over the directions	I didn t	sd	1
I didn t	One two three four  five six	sd	1
Want to try the stones to make sure	One two three four five six	sd	1
Could you read that first  problem for us again	David has 14 Lego blocks	sd	1
David has 14 Lego blocks	Paul has 5 Lego blocks	sd	1
Paul has 5 Lego blocks	How  many more Lego blocks does David have than Paul	sd	1
Let s  count the fourteen for me	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen	sd	4
Okay now perhaps you  can compare and see how many more Lego blocks does  David have than Paul	I got nine	sd	4
Okay perhaps you can share that with  the children in your group	Me and Milin got nine Jamie got eight	sd	4
Now where are the five for Paul	Right here	sd	4
Okay now how many more does David have	Eight	aa	4
Now count the ones that remain	One two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	1
Okay it s nice to  use	Fourths	aa	4
Fourths	Fourths	aa	4
Fourths	Well I put the four blocks up to the brown	sd	4
Well I put the four blocks up to the brown	Cause this is one  and if you line them all up  like that and you add them all up it would be four wholes	sd	5
Cause this is one  and if you line them all up  like that and you add them all up it would be four wholes	The red	sd	4
The red	You would take a white rod and stick it right on the end of a red  one	sd	4
Tell me  about this model and tell me just what you told me before	Ok originally I had two oranges and that was that would only use  twenty of the whites but if you added another two of them on it  would be forty of the whites	sd	5
Ok originally I had two oranges and that was that would only use  twenty of the whites but if you added another two of them on it  would be forty of the whites	So the whites down here are the  fortieths	sd	5
So the whites down here are the  fortieths	And the purples would take five to use  for the two and  another five over here so that would be the tenths	sd	5
And the purples would take five to use  for the two and  another five over here so that would be the tenths	And now these  if you put two oranges together the two oranges each would be the  halves	sd	5
And now these  if you put two oranges together the two oranges each would be the  halves	These would be the twentieths  and the browns would  be the fifths	sd	5
These would be the twentieths  and the browns would  be the fifths	Now there should be I think nineteen more on here to  complete the fortieths	sd	5
Now there should be I think nineteen more on here to  complete the fortieths	You cant make the model any bigger than  this You would have to use one blue	sd	5
You cant make the model any bigger than  this You would have to use one blue	It wouldnt be the exact size	sd	5
It wouldnt be the exact size	So you cant make a model any bigger than  this without making a train making all these uneven	sd	5
So you cant make a model any bigger than  this without making a train making all these uneven	So basically  this is the only model you can make thats even without using  trains like this one here that would make  all of these unequal	sv	5
So if I wanted to continue my train with oranges youre saying I  would have trouble showing	Another four no another four oranges to fit five more of the  browns on so it would be a yard long probably	sd	5
If you wan if  you wanted to make a train though where you were adding a  different color rod on the end of this train of four oranges do you  think you could come up with other models	Well it could be but this is the basically the only equal  model  using you know tenths twentieths fortieths	sd	5
Well it could be but this is the basically the only equal  model  using you know tenths twentieths fortieths	for the whole	sd	5
How would you go for eighty	Oh God	ba	1
Oh God	For eighty	aa	1
For eighty	I would go back to my calculations	sd	1
I would go back to my calculations	For eighty steps this is what I would do	sd	1
Eight zero	Yeah yeah	b	1
Last time you understood four hundred	I know what you are saying	sd	1
I know what you are saying	Didn t I do this on the other paper	sd	1
You did for eight	I know I know that s what I am saying	sd	1
I know I know that s what I am saying	OK it is twentysix	sd	4
OK it is twentysix	Twentysix times ten I didn t even get one man	sd	1
Twentysix times ten I didn t even get one man	I didn t get even a single juice	sd	1
You are saying for eighty right	Yes	b	1
How many you have	Two hundred sixty	sd	4
How did you do it	What I did was eight rods	sd	4
Which one of the two rules did you use	The Evens	sd	4
Take that number divide it by half right	Yeah	b	1
Did you do that for eighty	For who	sd	1
Eighty is an odd even number right	No because   yeah yeah and then I subtract two from this	sd	4
No because   yeah yeah and then I subtract two from this	Two fiftyeight	sd	4
What I am trying to say	Look this is what I did	sd	1
Look this is what I did	OK	b	1
Is eighty an even number or not	Yeah	b	1
So how can you do that	Because for eight rods it is twentysix	sd	4
Twentysix	So that represents eight and eight times ten is eighty so it is twentysix times ten equals two hundred and sixty and minus two equals two hundred and fiftyeight	sd	5
A hundred and twenty	I just hate that	sd	1
One two zero	Six that is sixty times two	sd	4
Six that is sixty times two	I got you	aa	1
I got you	So twenty that will be six times ten will be my sixty and twenty times two is two hundred minus the two is one hundred and ninety eight and that will be my sixty times two	sd	5
I don t see half of one twenty	Huh	b	1
In your rule you said you will do half of that one twenty	Yeah	b	1
Half is sixty	I know	aa	1
So how are you going to do it	I did	sd	1
I did	This six times ten is sixty	sd	5
This six times ten is sixty	My sixty is two hundred and two hundred minus two equals one hundred and ninetyeight so this is my sixty	sd	5
My sixty is two hundred and two hundred minus two equals one hundred and ninetyeight so this is my sixty	And then my sixty times two is	sd	5
Thirty	Three hundred and ninesix minus   Wait a minute	sd	4
Three hundred and ninesix minus   Wait a minute	Did I do my math right	sd	1
Did I do my math right	What	ba	1
What	We did not need to hear that	sd	1
We did not need to hear that	Let me just finish this problem real quick	sd	1
Let me just finish this problem real quick	OK nine times two is eighteen plus one is nineteen	sd	5
OK nine times two is eighteen plus one is nineteen	OK OK Then subtract two is three hundred ninety four	sd	5
OK OK Then subtract two is three hundred ninety four	I am nice	sd	1
David	He confused the area and the perimeter	sd	4
Can you explain a little more	He thought the perimeter was the area	sd	4
Can you tell me why 12 inches might be the perimeter	Because its 4 sides	sd	5
Its 4 sides	and 3 inches each	sd	4
What does the 28 actually mean	Its the area	sd	4
And then what do you have there	What	ba	1
What do you have there	12345   28	sd	4
Or the perimeter	Its the area	sd	4
His friend said what did his friend say	That the area is 22	sd	4
And do you agree	No	b	1
What was the friend confused about	I think its because he um accidentally added	sd	5
What was he doing	Um figuring out the perimeter	sd	4
Can you figure out the perimeter then	Yeah	b	1
So what was his friend thinking	That the area was that youre supposed to add	sd	4
So then you just proved that this is what	22	b	4
And thats the	Perimeter	sd	4
Show me the perimeter on your rectangle	How	aa	3
What did we do with the first picture	We colored the outside	sd	4
So could you show me the perimeter	Like this	sd	4
What did you do there	I  um showed the numbers the number in square inches and added the numbers like 28	sd	4
So then you agreed with  Robbie	Mmm hmm	sd	1
And so what was his friend thinking	I think his friend was thinking Yeah	sd	1
I think his friend was thinking Yeah	I think he was counting the perimeter instead	sd	4
Mmm hmm	Cause 7  cause  he was adding instead of multiplying	sd	5
Mmmm	He was adding all the length and width	sd	4
So maybe after you talk I might get some new hands up	Uh the square inches for the	sd	4
So then whats the area of this rectangle	28	b	4
And how do you know	Because of the square inches	sd	5
The square inches  youre actually looking at  whats inside	The area	sd	4
What do you see	Um um	sd	1
And how many squares are inside	28	b	4
Okay thank you Connie	She put 4 rows and 7 columns	sd	4
Okay why	Because its 4 is the height and 7 is the width	sd	5
What shape do you see inside	Squares	aa	4
Desiree	Because greens the perimeter	sd	5
Okay and red is	the area	sd	4
You want to say it to the camera or to everybody	It s just for number eight	sd	1
Who s talking	He can	sd	1
He can	Well like here it s zero and then it goes plus two then plus four then plus six then plus eight then plus ten	sd	5
Well like here it s zero and then it goes plus two then plus four then plus six then plus eight then plus ten	Then more plus twelve then plus fourteen	sd	5
You wouldn t be willing to tell that to everybody	Yeah why not	b	1
Yeah why not	It works for this one	sd	4
Would you explain it to everybody	It starts atyou explain it I m not good at explaining it	sd	1
It starts atyou explain it I m not good at explaining it	Here it s zero and then this is two then four then six eight then ten and if you keep going down it would be twelve fourteen if it went on	sd	5
OK I think that s worth thinking about Jeffery did you have something to show	Should I show everyone	sd	1
OK anybody else coming to help or are you doing it by yourself	I ll do it by myself	sd	1
I ll do it by myself	Basically when you start with two zeros you re going to subtract you know how when it s like box times box plus one equals triangle but if it s there s two zeros starting out it s going to be box times box minus a number equals triangle	sd	5
Basically when you start with two zeros you re going to subtract you know how when it s like box times box plus one equals triangle but if it s there s two zeros starting out it s going to be box times box minus a number equals triangle	We don t really know but we tried different numbers and it works out every time	sd	5
We don t really know but we tried different numbers and it works out every time	Yes you do if there s double zeros on the thing you minus	sd	5
Yes you do if there s double zeros on the thing you minus	Yeah we did we subtracted on eight and subtracted on nine too	sd	5
Yeah we did we subtracted on eight and subtracted on nine too	No I m not going to show you my paper	sd	1
OK but they re carefully not showing you their formula but they did tell you one interesting thing to think about	We re ready to explain what we got	sd	1
Okay	OK everybody goes up	sd	1
OK everybody goes up	Should I write I don t think I should write	sd	1
Should I write I don t think I should write	I don t know what to write	sd	1
I don t know what to write	Should I just this out	sd	1
Should I just this out	Well see don t erase the whole thing	sd	1
Well see don t erase the whole thing	OK you just divide basically to get the answer	sd	5
OK you just divide basically to get the answer	Like divide two into two and you get one if you multiply two times one plus zero you get two and that s what you re supposed to get because two s in the triangle	sd	5
Like divide two into two and you get one if you multiply two times one plus zero you get two and that s what you re supposed to get because two s in the triangle	And the triangle s supposed to be at the end	sd	5
And the triangle s supposed to be at the end	Divide six times three and you get two	sd	5
I think you mean divide six by three and you get two	You do	qy	1
You do	Awesome and that s one and then you take the one and the two out of there and the two times one I have to move down and then you just plus zero cause that s the number you have up there to start with and then it equals that two	sd	5
Awesome and that s one and then you take the one and the two out of there and the two times one I have to move down and then you just plus zero cause that s the number you have up there to start with and then it equals that two	This number should always be in the triangle at the end	sd	5

So What does this look like	An H	sd	4
What does this now look like for you	A chain or a necklace or something	sd	4
suppose it stands up	A building	sd	4
A building	Like a tower	sd	4
If its stand what would you call it	A building	sd	4
In this particular case what would you call this if we called this a ladder	A step	sd	4
Could that also be a ladder	Yes	b	1
And how many	eight	sd	4
So my question to you is that how many would that be if we had  rods how many would we need to build a ladder with 10 steps	Wow three steps	sd	4
Wow three steps	Ah I got an idea	sd	1
Ah I got an idea	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Thirtyfour	aa	4
For ten	For ten	sd	1
You also have the same number	Thirtyfour	aa	4
Thirtyfour	Yeah	b	1
How do you	I counted how many rods it is and then I just multiplied by two because five times two is ten	sd	5
I counted how many rods it is and then I just multiplied by two because five times two is ten	It was seventeen rods so seventeen times two is thirtyfour	sd	5
You are so fast for me	OK I did five steps and then I counted how many rods that was	sd	5
OK I did five steps and then I counted how many rods that was	It was seventeen and since five is half of ten five times two is ten so I just multiplied the number of rods by two and I got thirtyfour for seventeen rods	sd	5
So how would you get for hundred then	Four hundred	b	1
Four hundred	Two sixtytwo	sd	4
Two sixtytwo	I got two hundred and sixtytwo	sd	4
I got two hundred and sixtytwo	There is an announcement over the PA system	sd	1
There is an announcement over the PA system	I got one thousand three hundred and sixty	sd	4
I got one thousand three hundred and sixty	I just do this by times eighty	sd	4
How many you got	Thirteen sixty	sd	4
We have to find a way to figure this out whether it is right or wrong	It is right	aa	4
It can t be that for a hundred	Look ten is thirtyfour and ten times ten is one hundred so thirtyfour times ten is three hundred and forty   let me write that   OK then three hundred and forty times four which would be three hundred forty equals one hundred rods so three hundred and forty times four would be one thousand three hundred and sixty	sd	5
What is that four	The hundreds	sd	4
The hundreds	I got a different one	sd	2
I got a different one	which is eighty so I had to multiply seventeen times eighty	sd	2
What is that thirtyfour comes from	That is thirtyfour rods you would use to make ten steps	sv	4
Then you are multiplying by	By ten because ten times ten is one hundred	sd	5
Yeah	So thirtyfour times ten is three hundred and forty	sd	5
Yeah	And for four hundred it would be three hundred and forty times four since three hundred and forty would be one hundred steps so one hundred times four is four hundred	sd	5
What is that four come from	The one hundred times four	sd	4
What is that four	The steps	sd	4
But I am asking for a hundred steps	What	ba	1
We are saying for a hundred right	You said four hundred	sd	4
I am sorry did you understand four hundred	Yeah	b	1
I am sorry I meant a hundred	Oh three hundred and forty	sd	4
Three hundred and forty	Yeah	b	1

More specific	Two lengths	sd	4
Who can say in words how he is going to mark three times five on the upper straight line	I draw this length twice eh three times next to each other	sd	4
Now explain to me what I should do on the other straight line Bal Rafael	I take the compass of three centimeters and mark it from the right to the left	sd	4
What exactly are you doing with these three with the length three that you have been adapting to the compass	Eh I subtract it from from the lower straight line from the right to the left	sd	4
How many times	Twice	sd	4
Comment on what youre doing	Well you have to eh five plus five plus five plus five minus three	sd	5
Well you have to eh five plus five plus five plus five minus three	Well can I present it in one step	sd	1
Well can I present it in one step	Without minus	sd	4
Is it okay like that	Yes I think so	sv	2
Yes I think so	Well maybe you should ehm move over ehm the yellow one	sd	4
Well maybe you should ehm move over ehm the yellow one	So that its  with the line	sd	2
So that its  with the line	Yes exactly	aa	2
Can you show it Tamara	Ehm down there	sd	1
Yes	Here	sd	1
From the left margin of the blackboard to the margin of the sheet on the right	Yes	b	1
Do you have another idea	Mhm yes	aa	1
Namely	Eh five and four times the three times the five	sd	5
Sandra please also comment on what youre doing	Five times three	sd	5
Five times three	Plus three times three	sd	5
Christoph	Plus three	sd	4
Jenny	Equals 27	sd	4
And further Andi	Ehm you ehm have to if you calculate three times five you have to take the three five times and not one sheet of five and one of three	sd	5
Tamara	A length of eight	sd	4
Not 27 or 26 but a total length would be here	teen	sd	4
At the blackboard	So five times five equals equals 25	sd	5
Stephanie	Equals ten	sd	4
Equals ten	Well cant I multi eh multiply that	sd	4
Desiree	He should put up all sheets of five because thats the only way they can be 25	sd	5
He should put up all sheets of five because thats the only way they can be 25	Because we also have to count five and five and five	sd	5
Well That way yes I will let Anja explain too	Ehm five is just like a length of five centimeters and five five is 10 centimeters	sd	5
Ehm five is just like a length of five centimeters and five five is 10 centimeters	But you want 25	sd	2
One moment do you understand that	Yes ah the	sd	1
Michelle	I would only mark it four times	sd	4
Adrian are you satisfied with your work	Yes	b	1

What does the arrow indicate	Oh yes I know	aa	1
Oh yes I know	Where it goes through well it goes this way and afterwards at the lower line it continues that way	sd	4
Where it goes through well it goes this way and afterwards at the lower line it continues that way	Yes	b	1
What calculating operation	Plus	sd	4
Here it would be nine hm	Mhm yes	aa	1
Could you also do the problem at the blackboard	With the sheets	sd	1
So now Im going to ask you how to present problem two A the number 15	Eh mark the five three times ehm on one line	sd	4
B the number 12	Also three times the five and then one times the three on the second line	sd	5
In the	In the counter direction	sd	4
Carmen	Two times the five and in the counter direction one times the three That is minus	sd	5
Two times the five and in the counter direction one times the three That is minus	Plus eh	sd	2
What is your comment about Anjas work at the blackboard	Eh not so exact but it is correct	sd	4
If you say not so exact what is it that is not so exact	Eh the lines	sd	4
Mhm I see	Not so exact	sd	4
But basically its correct	Eh	b	1
Patrick please read it out loud	are drawn	sd	1
Three	X Y and Z	sd	4
So how do we present the term X plus Y minus Z Fabian	First the just draw a line somewhere a	sd	4
Exactly the way that you instruct me to	Then put a starting point somewhere	sd	4
Yes	And then mark the length X	sd	5
And then mark the length X	From this point mark the length Y	sd	5
From this point mark the length Y	And then a second length	sd	5
And then a second length	Eh line and then from this point at the Y  ehm in the counter direction Z	sd	4
Menhir	It is correct	sd	1
Or did you think it was correct	Yes	b	1
You dont agree	That eh thats the eh the last length which Fabian drew just now	sd	2
Yes	He he actually should have drawn the length X the length Y and the length Z	sd	2
Can you also describe it in words what your head shaking means	Hrm no its correct	sd	2
Hrm no its correct	Because	sd	1
Because	Because X plus Y minus Z is equal to a length and that length you have to in	sd	5
Think about E	E	b	1
It will come out even better Fabian and Menhir if you comment on what you are doing	Eh well here we have drawn a straight line and eh a starting point and now we will mark Y here the first time	sd	5
Eh well here we have drawn a straight line and eh a starting point and now we will mark Y here the first time	From this point once more once more	sd	5
From this point once more once more	And	sd	5
And	The yellow here thats the length five times Y	sd	5
Could you also name the partial lengths	Thats correct	ba	2
Which one	C	b	1
Also C	We mark the length Z three times	sd	4
From where to where does three Z go	Mh from here to here	sd	1
Christoph	Its correct	sd	2
Please go ahead then	Im making a length again	sd	4
Im making a length again	Eh a straight line	sd	5
Eh a straight line	And mark the starting point	sd	5
And mark the starting point	Then Im marking Y	sd	5
Then Im marking Y	And four times Z	sd	5
And four times Z	Now thats the the length	sd	5
What length	Y plus four times Z	sd	4
Two times X plus Z	All right I draw a straight line	sd	4
All right I draw a straight line	Put a point somewhere	sd	2
Put a point somewhere	Then I mark Y twice	sd	5
Then I mark Y twice	And then Z once again	sd	5
Jenny	Its correct	sd	2
The letter E does not stand for a length anymore but in our case Debbie	Admission fee for an adult	sd	4
In exactly the same way the letter K stands for Pascal	Eh the admission fee for a child	sd	4
The letter A means in our case Tamara	Additional charge for a locker	sd	4
And finally the letter B according to our problem Menhir	Additional charge for a cabin	sd	4
Please explain Fabian	Ehm the family has to consist of five people	sd	4
Mhm yes namely	Two adults and three children	sd	4
It consists of two adults three children What else	They take three lockers and one cabin	sd	4
Ok Lets listen to Davids theory and see if we could  convince those or else they have to show us our theory doesnt  work	Well first um Meredith made um a model which had one  orange one blue and one black	sd	2
Thats  what you told me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	sd	2
And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	Twentyfourths	sd	2
Twentyfourths	Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and um	sd	2
Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and um	Just like the one up there	sd	4
Just like the one up there	Yeah	b	2
So youre saying that if I had an orange a blue and a black that the  model should look like the one up here	Just about	sd	4
See what happens	But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	sd	1
But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	sd	4
Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites couldnt be  twentyfourths	sd	2
Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites couldnt be  twentyfourths	Right it would either take one	sd	2
Andrew and Jessica what do you  think	Well I made a model  that had the white was one fortyeighth and the purples were  twelfths and the white was I mean the red was twentyfourths and I  took two browns as the thirds and two dark greens as the fourths  and they I called them the fourths and then the whole was four  oranges and two purples	sd	5
Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns to be	One like one one third	sd	4
One like one one third	Yeah	b	4
One brown was one third two browns was two thirds	No	b	1
Is that what youre telling me	No	b	1
No	Two browns was one third	sd	4
Two browns was one third	Two browns was one third	sd	2
Two browns was one third	I took two browns and put them together	sd	4
Two browns to be one third	Yeah	b	1
Ok lets  see what theyre doing here because um it looks to me as if you  need a bunch of rods to do this	It might not be enough	sd	4
I think can you see Alan and Erik	Not really	sd	1
So some of you may have to go up in a minute to see  what theyre doing	Well what we did was we made a model and we counted um	sd	4
Well what we did was we made a model and we counted um	four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our thirds we  counted we counted two oranges as one I mean two browns as  one	sd	5
four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our thirds we  counted we counted two oranges as one I mean two browns as  one	And we had	sd	1
And we had	that was our third	sd	4
that was our third	That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two greens as  one  two dark greens as  one	sd	4
That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two greens as  one  two dark greens as  one	Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were fortyeights	sd	4
Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were fortyeights	Fortyeighths	sd	2
Fortyeighths	And we think that we think that three um fourths  are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I mean four  fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	sd	5
And we think that we think that three um fourths  are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I mean four  fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	No two twentyfourths	sd	2
No two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourth or whats that	sd	3
Two twentyfourth or whats that	One twelfth	sd	4
What do you think about that Michael	I guess I agree with it its what I came up with	sd	2
You came up with the same model didnt you	Yeah	b	1
Meredith and David  and Erik and Alan  does this model have anything to do with the  theory you tested David	Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one forty eighth	sd	5
Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one forty eighth	And and the	sd	1
And and the	And then the reds would be um one	sd	4
And then the reds would be um one	Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought that the  light greens would be well David thought that the light greens  would be twelfths but then we tried it and they would become the  sixteenths so then we tried the purple yeah the sixteenths and we  tried the purple and then that was the twelfths	sd	5
Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought that the  light greens would be well David thought that the light greens  would be twelfths but then we tried it and they would become the  sixteenths so then we tried the purple yeah the sixteenths and we  tried the purple and then that was the twelfths	Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	sd	5
Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	So in other words we doubled everything	sd	2
So in other words we doubled everything	Yeah	b	5
Yeah	You basically just added like there originally were just two  oranges now there are four oranges and an extra purple	sd	5
You basically just added like there originally were just two  oranges now there are four oranges and an extra purple	Now there  are six there are six browns	sd	5
All of these  represent one is that a surprise	It could have been two purples changing into a brown	sd	4
It could have been two purples changing into a brown	Yeah	b	1
Thats true	And	sd	1
You see this one here you  called the orange and red one isnt that right and here you called  one two orange and purple right	So basically its just doubled	sd	4
So basically its just doubled	Thats	ba	1
In what way is it doubled	Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and two  purples or a brown so	sd	5
But the first one doesnt have any purples	Well thats because this had nothing to do with the first problem  because of the first question but	sv	5
Im not sure I understand what youre saying	Had there have been sixths	sd	4
Had there have been sixths	I know	aa	1
We didnt have sixths we had twelfths here	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Mmm hmm	I think I know what hes saying	sd	2
I think I know what hes saying	Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are forty eighths this time	sd	5
Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are forty eighths this time	Now up there there are no purples because they  werent put on	sd	5
Now up there there are no purples because they  werent put on	But had they have been on the bottom which they  are they are twelfths because	sd	5
But had they have been on the bottom which they  are they are twelfths because	Purples	sd	2
Purples	In that	sd	1
In that	Purples are twelfths	sd	4
Purples are twelfths	In that model they became twelfths but over there they would be  the sixths	sd	5
In that model they became twelfths but over there they would be  the sixths	Like Amy said if	sd	2
Like Amy said if	Right because if you double each of them it would come out to  twice the number	sd	5
Right because if you double each of them it would come out to  twice the number	Exactly	aa	2
James	Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and two  purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the reds there  its two reds make a purple and that that means the two oranges  and the red make two oranges and a purple	sd	5
Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and two  purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the reds there  its two reds make a purple and that that means the two oranges  and the red make two oranges and a purple	Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model and a  purple and then two more oranges and a purple and you put them  on top of each other theyd be equal	sd	5
Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model and a  purple and then two more oranges and a purple and you put them  on top of each other theyd be equal	But if you put em side to side  youd have four oranges and two purples or the two purples could  be a brown	sd	5
But if you put em side to side  youd have four oranges and two purples or the two purples could  be a brown	So its basically doubled each of the length is doubled	sd	5
But how did the red get  doubled	The red	sd	4
Im confused how did the red get doubled here	The red	sd	4
Kimberly	Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a purple so  now if they have a purple they doubled the red	sd	5
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I was going to say something different	sd	2
What would you expect we would have then if its  doubled	Um four oranges and two purples	sd	4
Do we have four oranges and two purples	One two three four yup or four oranges and one brown	sd	4
Or four oranges and one brown	Yep	b	1
If I were to make another model  Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question what do you  think my question is Andrew	If you were gonna make another model what um the doubles be	sd	4
Brian	Um fortyeight	sd	4
Imagine in your head what I would call  one	Fortyeight	b	5
Fortyeight	Cuz there would be well cuz there would be forty eight whites equal up to one and then	sd	5
In this model	So we have to double that	sd	4
So we have to double that	But no	sd	2
I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew what do  you think	Well youre saying what	sd	1
Well youre saying what	No it cant	sd	4
No it cant	Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	sd	4
Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	It cant be done	sd	2
Eight orange rods Im listening	Eight orange rods and two browns	sd	4
Eight orange rods and two browns	And two browns	sd	2
And two brown rods	You cant double that	sd	5
You cant double that	You cant double that model because if you  did then you wouldnt be able to third it	sv	5
You cant double that model because if you  did then you wouldnt be able to third it	You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you just train  it	sd	2
You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you just train  it	Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges and  two browns now is there any rod that could third that	sd	3
Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges and  two browns now is there any rod that could third that	Well if you use a train	sd	2
Well if you use a train	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	sd	2
If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	sd	5
Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	It would probably be	sd	1
It would probably be	Up there its just plain except for the whole	sd	4
Up there its just plain except for the whole	It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and three  dark greens would be the fourths	sd	4
It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and three  dark greens would be the fourths	Right but that would be using more than one rod to make another  rod to fit fit the same thing	sd	2
Right but that would be using more than one rod to make another  rod to fit fit the same thing	Yeah so you can do that	aa	2
Yeah so you can do that	Just like you Andrew said you can use  a train to make a third and a fourth	sd	5
Just like you Andrew said you can use  a train to make a third and a fourth	Cuz he like I I overheard  they said that if you can use a train to make a whole why cant you  use it to make a third and a fourth	sd	5
Cuz he like I I overheard  they said that if you can use a train to make a whole why cant you  use it to make a third and a fourth	Yeah	b	2
David	And a half	sd	4
And a half	But then it wouldnt be equal	sd	2
But then it wouldnt be equal	Yeah they would	sd	5
Yeah they would	Cuz the third could be like in that model  Andrew used the two browns thats equal	sd	5
Cuz the third could be like in that model  Andrew used the two browns thats equal	But in that model the three browns dont have anything attached  on so its totally equal	sd	5
But in that model the three browns dont have anything attached  on so its totally equal	They just doubled it	sd	2
They just doubled it	But if you added something on	sd	2
But if you added something on	We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that model	sd	4
We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that model	Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	sd	4
Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	Yeah exactly	b	2
Yeah exactly	So in the next model	sd	1
Did you want to say something	Um I agree with Erik	sd	2
What part of what Erik said	Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like Erik said  that you can train it and put the other blocks onto the other one	sd	2
Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like Erik said  that you can train it and put the other blocks onto the other one	What I meant what I meant is you cant third it just using one rod	sd	4
Ok Alan	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	You cant third it using one rod but you can third it using  trains	sd	5
You cant third it using one rod but you can third it using  trains	You could double that but you would have to use two rods to  make it	sd	5
Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can imagine   can you make one bigger than that	If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges  and  sixteen oranges and four browns	sd	5
Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id like you  to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful models you built  but the question Id like you to think about is uh is there is there a  biggest model	Thirtytwo oranges	sd	4
And if you dont have enough uh rods  you could imagine we could write to Cuisenaire and we can have  them ship us buckets and buckets and buckets and buckets	Or we could combine all our stuff	sd	1
Or we could combine all our stuff	We could start by that but my question to all of you is there a  biggest model	sd	1
We could start by that but my question to all of you is there a  biggest model	Why or why not	sd	1
Why or why not	And Id like you to write to me  about about that	sd	1
And Id like you to write to me  about about that	Would you do that	qy	1
Would you do that	Would you write to me	sd	1
Would you write to me	Maybe Mrs Phillips can let you combine and build together that  might take a little while	sd	1
Maybe Mrs Phillips can let you combine and build together that  might take a little while	I just noticed one plus one is two So you couldnt get that so I thought  about one times two and that will be two and then add one and thats  three	sd	5
Do you want another  problem	Whatever	sd	1
Lets try this one	Five plus two	sd	4
Five plus two	Oh this is easy	sd	1
Oh this is easy	Its the same thing just  wait a minute  yeah it is the same thing no no its not yeah yeah	sd	4
Its the same thing just  wait a minute  yeah it is the same thing no no its not yeah yeah	Its the same thing	sd	4
What do you mean by same thing	Its zero times two plus five is five	sd	5
Its zero times two plus five is five	Zero times two plus five is five	sd	5
Zero times two plus five is five	One times two is two plus five is is  seven	sd	5
One times two is two plus five is is  seven	Then two times two wait a minute I mean two plus seven	sd	5
Then two times two wait a minute I mean two plus seven	Three times five is eight I mean fifteen three times five is fifteen	sd	5
Three times five is eight I mean fifteen three times five is fifteen	I didnt say five I said plus five	sd	2
I didnt say five I said plus five	Its times two	sd	4
Its times two	Plus five	sd	2
Plus five	Three times two is six	sd	5
Three times two is six	So one times two is two plus five is seven and then two times two is four  plus five is nine three times three is six I mean three times two two  two two  let me  write	sd	5
So one times two is two plus five is seven and then two times two is four  plus five is nine three times three is six I mean three times two two  two two  let me  write	Times two plus five	sd	5
Times two plus five	I got this big O mark	sd	1
I got this big O mark	Zero times two plus five equals five	sd	5
Zero times two plus five equals five	And then look one times  two is two and two plus five is seven	sd	5
And then look one times  two is two and two plus five is seven	Then two times two is four and  plus five is nine	sd	5
Then two times two is four and  plus five is nine	Three times three times two two two is six plus five  is eleven then four times two is eight plus five is thirteen	sd	5
Three times three times two two two is six plus five  is eleven then four times two is eight plus five is thirteen	This is easy	sd	1
This is easy	Done	b	1
Done	Next	b	1
How do you compare the first one and the second one when you  were telling me it is the same thing	Because it is both times two	sd	5
Because it is both times two	You are just  changing the adding	sd	5
You are just  changing the adding	Next	sd	1
Next	Times something plus something	sd	1
Times something plus something	Now we can take a break	sd	1
Or do you  think that is the only rule we can get	Thats the only one we can get	sd	1
Thats the only one we can get	Times no times four plus no	sd	4
Times no times four plus no	Oh I see a pattern	sd	1
Oh I see a pattern	I cant even do that its too hard	sd	1
I cant even do that its too hard	I see a pattern  though	sd	1
I see a pattern  though	It is going to be straight up	sd	4
It is going to be straight up	Im done	sd	1
Im done	Ohhhh	b	1
Ohhhh	I see it	sd	1
I see it	Its add by five Zero plus five	sd	5
Its add by five Zero plus five	No first is five you add  five right here	sd	5
No first is five you add  five right here	Then you add six then you add seven then you add  eight then nine and then right here you add twentyfive thirty	sd	5
Then you add six then you add seven then you add  eight then nine and then right here you add twentyfive thirty	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	How are we doing this again	sd	3
How are we doing this again	0310	sd	1
So explain to me what you are doing here	Because zero plus five is five and then one plus six is seven and then  two plus seven is nine then three plus eight is eleven and four plus nine  is thirteen	sd	5
And what about for twentyfive	And then twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	sd	5
Why thirty	Because twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	sd	5
Because twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	Well I just put that because  you asked me whats twentyfive plus	sd	5
I was just curious to see because I see here you said Im going to add  five here then Im going to add six here then Im going to add seven      here how you know when you get down to twentyfive you are going to  add thirty there	Ten eleven twelve then thirteen and then fourteen and then fifteen   and then for twentyfive	sd	5
What if I wanted to know the value for eightytwo	You mean we can write eightytwo right here	sd	1
Hmm hmm	Then you will try to	sd	1
Do you want to explain to  him what you have found	No I dont remember	sd	1
OK then how about if I ask you for eightytwo X is eightytwo	X is eightytwo	aa	1
X is eightytwo	And then you would just	sd	1
And then you would just	Oh X is eightytwo	sd	1
Oh X is eightytwo	You said that that was eightytwo	sd	1
You said that that was eightytwo	Oh thats easy	ba	1
If X was eightytwo	You would add um zero X oh eightytwo	sd	5
You would add um zero X oh eightytwo	Its One hundred and sixty four and then you gotta add five so  one hundred  and sixtynine	sd	5
OK so what did you use to get this number	Multiply eightytwo by two and then add five to the answer and then I  get one hundred and sixty nine	sd	5
OK so this was using this equation	Yeah	b	1
Ok and then you told me you found another way of finding the  numbers	Yeah and then you notice that eightytwo plus	sd	4
Can you explain to T2 what you have found here	Oh for like every number you add another one for like zero is five since  youre going to one now you add another is six going to two you add      another is seven going to three you add another is eight going to four  you add another is nine	sd	5
And so how would you express that rule	Huh	b	1
Huh	Well the first rule that we came up with was times two plus five	sd	5
Well the first rule that we came up with was times two plus five	Because zero times two plus five is five	sd	5
Because zero times two plus five is five	One times two is two plus five  is seven and then we can up with	sd	5
Does it work for the others	Yeah it worked for all of them and then we came up with this one	sd	4
Can you show me	Zero times two plus five equals five	sd	5
Zero times two plus five equals five	One times two plus five equals seven	sd	5
One times two plus five equals seven	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	Yeah yeah	b	1
Yeah yeah	Two times two plus five equals nine	sd	5
Two times two plus five equals nine	Then its three times two plus five equals eleven	sd	5
Then its three times two plus five equals eleven	And the pattern is five plus two is seven plus two is nine plus two is  eleven plus two is thirteen	sd	5
Do you and James agree on that	Yeah	b	2
Have you guys talked about it	Yeah	b	1
OK would you like another challenge	OKWe have already done two	sd	1
Let me give you a third one	They did the same model	sd	2

No it wouldnt yeah it would and then you  could make a train for the thirds	Ok  and then the browns two browns would make a train for one third	sd	4
Ok  and then the browns two browns would make a train for one third	Right	b	2
Right	And then	sd	1
And then	Woo woo woo woo	sd	1
Woo woo woo woo	And then two more browns would make another train for thirds	sd	4

David Just listen out	Me need a brown rod	sd	1
Me need a brown rod	It all works out	sd	1
It all works out	You know what you could try	sd	2
You know what you could try	Use three blues and the light green  then use the oranges to third it then you could fourth it easily	sd	5
Use three blues and the light green  then use the oranges to third it then you could fourth it easily	Now	sd	1
Now	I already have a third	sd	1
I already have a third	See just put down the purple and I took off  the green	sd	1

Yup	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	I thirded it	sd	4
I thirded it	One two three and then plus nine other of those which  would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	5
One two three and then plus nine other of those which  would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	So its just like  making a new rod	sd	1
So its just like  making a new rod	Fourthing it might be	sd	1
Fourthing it might be	Ok	b	1
Ok	I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones which  would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would add one to there  one to there and one to there which would be three	sd	5
I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones which  would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would add one to there  one to there and one to there which would be three	And then four  five six seven eight nine	sd	5
And then four  five six seven eight nine	So its like adding another blue but Im  making a new rod	sd	5
So its like adding another blue but Im  making a new rod	Well in thirds	sd	4
Well in thirds	Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the three next  to that and the three next to that	sd	5
Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the three next  to that and the three next to that	Huh	b	1
Huh	Ill show you what I mean	sd	1
Ill show you what I mean	How can we make it bigger than him	sd	3
How can we make it bigger than him	He did the exact same thing	sd	2
He did the exact same thing	Ohhhh	b	1
Ohhhh	Get it	sd	2
Get it	see there are there to that three to that and three to that so  its like its a blue plus one would be an orange plus another would  be a new rod plus another would be a new rod and if you have  another one itd youd youre just making new rods	sd	5
see there are there to that three to that and three to that so  its like its a blue plus one would be an orange plus another would  be a new rod plus another would be a new rod and if you have  another one itd youd youre just making new rods	Because if you  add one of those to that itd be an orange but then you add another  two itd be bigger than an orange	sd	5
Because if you  add one of those to that itd be an orange but then you add another  two itd be bigger than an orange	Told you I got it	sd	1
Told you I got it	Or you could just take the oranges and do that	sd	4
Or you could just take the oranges and do that	No those were uh   David You could take out the three six nine	sd	2
No those were uh   David You could take out the three six nine	You could take out the orange and use two ones	sd	2
You could take out the orange and use two ones	I think the greens would be sixteenths not   David You could take out the three six nine and put a blue in there	sd	2

What do you think	Which red rods	sd	1
Which red rods	These little ones	sd	4
What do you think	No	b	1
No	Look	sd	1
Look	Nope	sd	1
Nope	You d have to fit more here	sd	4
You d have to fit more here	There is enough to fit another light  green in here	sd	4
Danielle what do you think	No	b	1
Can you speak nice and loud Danielle	Put the two red ones next to the yellow one	sd	4
Put the two red ones next to the yellow one	And there s more space	sd	4
Okay someone told me that the  purple rod	This one	sd	1
Is half as long as the black rod	No	b	1
What do you think	No	b	2
No	Nope	sd	2
The black rod	Oh the black rod	sd	1
Oh the black rod	It would take another light green to make a whole and that s not  half	sd	5
It would take another light green to make a whole and that s not  half	That is not as long as the black it would take another light green  one	sd	4
That is not as long as the black it would take another light green  one	Oh	b	1
What do you think	No	b	1
David doesn t believe it why not David	Because if you put the two on top	sd	4
Nice and loud David	Cause if you put the two purple if you put the two purples on top  of each other they ll be taller than the black	sd	5
What do you think	Yep	b	2
Yep	Yep	b	2
Yep	Cause two of these would make	sd	5
Discuss it with your partner	Yeah I think so	sd	1
Yeah I think so	Umm cause if you did it like this	sd	4
Someone told me Jackie	Yeah	b	1
That s lovely thank you  Jackie	If you make this 99	sv	4
Yep	its 100 inches	sd	4
its 100 inches	But if we make this 999 it goes to 1000 inches	sd	5
Well think about it what happens when you add that 9	A zero is added on	sd	4
A zero is added on	Yeah but you make it	sd	2
A zero is added on but what happens to	more similar to the wide diameter	sd	4
So what does that mean about the comparison of the wide and narrow diameter	Its very important and it changes the radius	sd	4
It changes the what	It changes the roll radius	sd	4
So if I have a really really large wide diameter and a really really small narrow diameter how does that change the roll radius	It makes it smaller which means it cant go as far	sd	5
Now you guys have an example of when the narrow diameter is zero	So its like a triangle I think this way	sd	4
Whats a threedimensional word for it	A pyramid	sd	4
A pyramid	A cone	sd	2
Because you have to account for that missing cone part	Yeah	b	1
How would you account for that	Do you like add on that volume  or area to it and	sd	4
Do you like add on that volume  or area to it and	I dont know	sd	3
So so draw a picture and youll be able to kind of see okay	So like this	sd	4
So like this	And you have to take away this smaller triangle	sd	4
And you have to take away this smaller triangle	which is like	sd	1
which is like	When you  when you find the equation would you just add on this part of it	sd	4
So the whole equation will have to do with this whole image you have	Okay	b	1
So the roll radius when I have a zero as the narrow diameter is equal to what	The slant height	sd	4
Its equal to my slant height and then I also have to account for all the way down right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So how do I find that	sd	3
So how do I find that	Its like similar triangles	sd	4
And the game that were going to  play is called	Guess my rule	sd	1
Guess my rule	He told you that you were going to play the game or that you had  worked on that game already	sd	1
He told you which	That we were going to play Guess My Rule	sd	1
So uh the game goes as follows I am going to  think in my mind of some rule	And then you got to guess it	sd	1
Youre going to try and guess it but do you know how youre  going to try and guess the rule	Yea were going to be working with numbers	sd	1
My rule takes the number	You cant tell us what the rule is	sd	1
Okay	Oh	b	1
Thirteen	Is it Oh I know what to do	sd	1
Hold on	He just added eight	sd	4
He just added eight	Just add the eight	sd	2
Dont Dont say what you think the rule is	Then how are we supposed to know	sd	1
So the first number was what	Five and then	sd	4
And it gave you	Thirteen	sd	4
Alright but I dont  want you to try and guess the rule just yet	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	4
So Dawud said three and my number my what do you think  my number is going to do to three	Its going to make it into eleven	sd	4
Nope my rule takes  the number three and makes it seven	So how do you get thirteen from the five	sd	4
So how do you get thirteen from the five	Oh I get it	sd	1
Well you have to guess my rule	I get it	sd	1
But like for every	I know your rule	aa	1
Okay so what are the two results we have so far	Alright five and thirteen	sd	4
So you can mention another  number and Ill tell you	I know they both theyre both higher	sd	4
Okay Dawud said What number did Dawud just say	Wait I want to say a number he said one	sd	1
Wait I want to say a number he said one	Can I say four	sd	1
Can I say four	Dont say a number guess the rule	sd	1
What do you  think my rule is going to do to six	I know	aa	1
I know	Look Look Look	sd	1
Look Look Look	When you had	sd	1
Tell me what you think if we have six what do you think is  going to happen to six	Its going to go six to twentyfour	sd	4
Does everyone agree	I think six is going to go to ten	sd	4
You think six is going to go to ten	Cause look	sd	1
Cause look	We made five we made five with eight we made  seven with four	sd	5
We made five we made five with eight we made  seven with four	So six it will be twentyfour	sd	5
Does anyone else have a guess	I say ten I say ten	sd	4
I say ten I say ten	Its going to be twentyfour then thirtysix	sd	4
Why does  he think that	Fifteen	sd	4
Fifteen	Cause cause the first one is five and like I think that you keep on  adding on cause the number Like three you added it on four  for five its matching the five you added on eight	sd	5
Cause cause the first one is five and like I think that you keep on  adding on cause the number Like three you added it on four  for five its matching the five you added on eight	It depends on  the number thats how much you add on	sd	5
It depends on  the number thats how much you add on	Its eight	sd	4
Its eight	Its going to be eight	sd	4
Im going to write down the  number	I knew it was ten	sd	1
I knew it was ten	What are you talking about  its ten	sd	5
What are you talking about  its ten	Look cause 5 was at an eight then you added two more and for  like number 3 it was four	sd	5
Look cause 5 was at an eight then you added two more and for  like number 3 it was four	And if it was four you would add a  six	sd	5
And if it was four you would add a  six	And for five you would add eight	sd	5
He says that any number I put in this column you do  what Ariel	Well like it would depending on that number you would add  two on to what you did to the last one right	sd	5
Well like it would depending on that number you would add  two on to what you did to the last one right	Like cause five you  added eight and for six you added ten	sd	5
Like cause five you  added eight and for six you added ten	So and for three you  added four	sd	5
So and for three you  added four	So it would be eight then four then  ten	sd	5
So it would be eight then four then  ten	So like five is just one number lower than six and it was  eight	sd	5
So like five is just one number lower than six and it was  eight	And since the six is ten so I figured it would go by each  number add two	sd	5
James would you like to pick a number to try	Eight	sd	1
What number do you think my rule is  going to give back for eight	Eight	aa	1
Eight	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Eighteen	sd	4
Eighteen	Nah	b	2
Look at all the numbers	Could I see that paper	sd	1
Ill hold on to this	Oh I got it I know I got it	sd	1
Oh I got it I know I got it	Its twentytwo	sd	4
Its twentytwo	Eighteen	sd	2
Eighteen	Twentytwo	sd	2
Twentytwo	Twentytwo	sd	2
Twentytwo	How did you get twentytwo Ariel	sd	3
How did you get twentytwo Ariel	Add two	sd	4
Add two	What you talking about  add two	sd	3
What you talking about  add two	Oh I found a dollar	sd	1
Oh I found a dollar	It would be funny if I got nine	sd	1
It would be funny if I got nine	No its seventeen	sd	4
No its seventeen	It would be funny if you were wrong	sd	1
It would be funny if you were wrong	I think its twentytwo	sv	4
Okay can everyone see what Im writing	I know like a way to represent it too	sd	1
I know like a way to represent it too	Like the square is the  numbers going in like the triangle it goes into like a say a  factory and it comes out the triangle number	sd	5
Id like everyone to  hear what Ariel just said	Let Ariel talk	sd	1
Okay Ariel go ahead	Alright so like the square could be the number youre putting in  and it can say like it can go to like the factory or something like  that and it come out the number in the triangle triangle number	sd	5
Alright so like the square could be the number youre putting in  and it can say like it can go to like the factory or something like  that and it come out the number in the triangle triangle number	Square number and triangle number	sd	5
Okay so did you hear what Ariel said	Yup hes mad smart	sd	1
Yup hes mad smart	No he talks too fast	sd	1
Dawud could you tell us what Ariel said	Umm I didnt hear him	sd	1
Umm I didnt hear him	He talks too fast	sd	1
He talks too fast	Can you repeat that again please	sd	1
Can you repeat that again please	Can you repeat that	sd	1
Can you repeat that	The square could be like a type a number and then when it goes  into say like a factory or something like that	sd	5
The square could be like a type a number and then when it goes  into say like a factory or something like that	It would come out  the triangle type of number	sd	5
It would come out  the triangle type of number	So square is a number and triangle is a factor	sd	2
So square is a number and triangle is a factor	Is that what you  trying to say	sd	2
Is that what you  trying to say	Look look	sd	1
Look look	Its like the square is like the bigger kind of shape  and then the like triangle goes into the square to make	sd	5
Its like the square is like the bigger kind of shape  and then the like triangle goes into the square to make	It keep on multiplying by four	sd	5
Is that what you think	Look thats eight four then twelve	sd	5
Look thats eight four then twelve	So thats eight four  twelve	sv	5
So thats eight four  twelve	You mean adding	sd	2
You mean adding	You mean adding	sd	2
You mean adding	You mean factors of four	sd	2
You mean factors of four	Yea	b	1
Yea	No its not	sd	2
No its not	He means factors of four	sd	2
Alright here goes the number	So thats thats going to be eighteen	sv	4
So thats thats going to be eighteen	No its going to add up by  eighteen	sd	4
No its going to add up by  eighteen	No its going to be sixteen	sd	4
No its going to be sixteen	Look at the five look at the five	sd	2
Look at the five look at the five	Its twentytwo	sd	4
Its twentytwo	Its twentytwo	sd	2

Oh yeah its ten yeah	Twentyfour	sd	2
Twentyfour	Cause youre going to add six	sd	5
Cause youre going to add six	Cause for five you added um	sd	5
Cause for five you added um	But howbut how are you going to go	sd	3
But howbut how are you going to go	Wait so its minus another two	sd	4
Wait so its minus another two	minus four six	sd	4
minus four six	Cause for the five you had thirteen and then the six you got  eighteen you just added um  whats your name to this one and   whats your name to that one	sd	5
Cause for the five you had thirteen and then the six you got  eighteen you just added um  whats your name to this one and   whats your name to that one	The number is ten	sd	4
Okay	Zero is zero	sd	4
Zero is zero	Zero	sd	4
Zero	Zero	sd	4

Dont put zero	Come on Brandon	sd	1
Come on Brandon	Its zero	sd	4
Its zero	No two	sd	2
No two	No its not	sd	2
No its not	Its two	sd	4
My my rule says	It might be four	sd	4
It might be four	Negative two	sd	4
Negative two	I told you it was something two	sd	1
I told you it was something two	Ohhhhh	b	1
Ohhhhh	I told you it was  something two	sd	1
I told you it was  something two	Oh that relates to our	sd	1
Have you guessed have you guessed my rule yet	I did	sd	1
I did	Yeah the rule is by two	aa	4
What do you think the rule is	I think from zero No I didnt	sd	4
I think from zero No I didnt	I got your rule	aa	1
I got your rule	Two two eight eight	sd	4
Two two eight eight	Zero done messed up my whole thing	sd	1
Zero done messed up my whole thing	Look this is what I  thought So for four you added six for five you added eight for  six you added ten I mean twelve	sd	5
Look this is what I  thought So for four you added six for five you added eight for  six you added ten I mean twelve	Wait yeah yeahyeah	b	1
Wait yeah yeahyeah	Look can I guess	sd	1
Look can I guess	Its eight and then it goes then it goes eight	sd	5
Its eight and then it goes then it goes eight	Then it go twelve	sd	5
Then it go twelve	Then it go um I think its supposed to be by  adding four then add eight then it add four and then it add  eight	sd	5
Then it go um I think its supposed to be by  adding four then add eight then it add four and then it add  eight	I think that the total you get it adds by two	sv	2
Okay	Well at least he got the method right	sd	2
Well at least he got the method right	He or she got the method right and I hope the answer right	sd	2
Kevin what are you thinking	Hes very close to the answer but he messed up	sd	2
Hes very close to the answer but he messed up	So 1 cream plus 2 chocolate equals 3 so 3 of them they they subtract then they come out its 9 then he just go on not	sd	5
9 in all so youre saying theyre very close because they added the 1 and the 2 to get the 3 kind of like I think Ashank was helping us with over here	Uh huh	b	1
What did you want to add Cynthia	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	He knew that 1 cup of cream is with 2 cups of chocolate and that equals 3 but she knew that the total cups was 9 so had to multiply 3 by 3 and so they  2 cups of chocolate that would make 6 cups of chocolate	sd	5
Daniel	I would think hes right because he knows that theres 9 cups in total and for every 1 cup of cream theres 2 chocolates so he first adds them up and theres only 3 but then the whole thing is 9 so he thinks he should do more until he reaches 9 and then if you add the chocolates itd be 6	sd	5
This goes under your desk Jared	Bless you	sd	1
Lets go start the warmup please	Oh sorry	b	1
Yes	Can I  my backpack	sd	1
Yes quickly	Can I borrow a pencil	sd	1
Yes Bren	Can I sharpen my pencil	sd	1
Quickly please	I didnt finish	sd	1
You didnt do this part	No	sd	1
Oh and here you had to do the ones that were left not the ones you crossed out	Okay	b	1

Good work	This is my homework	sd	1
Did you pick up yesterdays homework	Im almost done with it	sd	1
Patrick homework	Yeah	b	1
Okay Aubrey good work	Thanks	b	1
Number one is that a right triangle	Yes	b	1
Yes John why	Twentyfive plus 144 equals 169	sd	5
Okay whered you get the 25 and the 144	Uh five squared plus 12 squared	sd	4
Number two Alex	Ten point five nine one three	sd	4
Number three Ryan	One and eightfifteenths	sd	4
Marcus how about four	Four point zero zero five	sd	4
Whatd you have Aubrey	One one and seven twentyones	sd	4
Reduce it Jen	I I got one and onethird	sd	4
Questions one through five	Number two	sd	1
What did you get for your first set of parentheses	Point one three four five	sd	4
Did you copy it correctly	No	b	1
Make sure you do that John	What was number two	sd	1
Ten point five nine one three	What was the first parenthesis	sd	3
Make sure you line up your decimals and then	Oops I added	sd	4
Ashley	The first one was yes right	sd	1
Correct	I got no	sd	4
Does it equal 13 squared	I had 25 plus 144	sd	4
Thats correct one	Equals 52	sd	4
Okay number six Patrick	Eight divided by four equals two and two plus two equals four and four times six equals 24	sd	5
Tim	Six times two equals 12 12 plus eight equals twenty	sd	5
Six times two equals 12 12 plus eight equals twenty	Twenty plus four equals 24	sd	5
Josh	Four minus two equals two uh six divided by two is three and three times eight is 24	sd	5
Good	Eight plus six is 14 14 times two is 28 and 28 minus four is 24	sd	5
Marcus	Uh six times two is 12 eight divided by four is two 12 times two is 24	sd	5
Another one Patrick	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Four divided by two equals two eight divided by two equals four and four times six equals 24	sd	5
Ryan	Nine minus seven equals two two times four equals eight three times eight is 24	sd	5
Alex	Nine times three is 27 27 minus seven is 20 and 20 plus four is 24	sd	5
Ashley	Seven minus three is four nine minus eight is six wait no Oops	sd	5
Seven minus three is four nine minus eight is six wait no Oops	I mean nine minus four is six	sd	5
Whats nine minus four	I got it wrong	sd	4
Thats okay	I did it right now	sd	1
Marcus	Nine minus seven is two eight I mean four times two is eight and eight times three is 24	sd	5
Good Patrick	Nine minus seven equals two two times three equals six six times four equals 24	sd	5
Again take a minute look see if you have any questions	What if you put on number uh where it says integers between negative five and negative eight	sd	3
What if you put on number uh where it says integers between negative five and negative eight	What if you put negative seven and negative six	sd	3
What if you put negative seven and negative six	Does it matter what order you put them	sd	3
No thats okay	Thank you	aa	1
Some of you drew lines which is okay	Uh I have a question	sd	3
Uh I have a question	Okay on the first it says like graph one through four	sd	3
Okay on the first it says like graph one through four	Its youre supposed to graph it on the top one right	sd	3
Its youre supposed to graph it on the top one right	Like on	sd	1
One through four	Yeah youre supposed to graph it on top right	sd	4
No I think	I mean I mean I mean one and four like that	sd	4
I mean I mean I mean one and four like that	Remember	sd	1
Here	Yeah	b	1
Is that was that your question	Yeah cause I put it	sd	1

All right were batting a thousand	Equal to less than and less than	sd	4
Marcus	Uh less than greater than and less than	sd	4
And Jen how about the last row	Greater than greater than greater than	sd	4
How many had all those right	Everybody	sd	1
Any questions on the second page	Yeah why wouldnt number three be equal	sd	3
Number three	Mhhm	b	1
Okay negative one and positive one	Yeah	b	1
Look up on the	Because its equal part so	sd	1
Not how far each one was apart from zero	Oh okay	b	1
Alex	A snake shake	sd	1
Raise your hand	The twentyeighth	sd	4
Ryan	The twentyeighth	sd	4
Yes	Are we allowed to take notes in pen if if we want to	sd	1
Michelle	What is the best What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task	sd	1
What is the best What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task	but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought and brought again and again before the mind with ever renewed encouragement	sd	1
Patrick	It means to not think of math as a like as not something fun to do and only use it in school but to use it in your everyday life	sd	2
Anybody else	That math is around you all the time	sd	1
Learn it because you want to and have it as a part of your daily life because math is	Power	sd	1
Ashley	How old is she turning	sd	4
Okay	Tom is five inches taller than Suzie	sd	4
Patrick	Uh never mind	sd	1
Kendra	Like when youre taking a test or something and the teacher is like you got a 20 out of like 40	sd	4
Is that how much they cost here	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yep	b	1
Yep	They rip you off	sd	1
Tim	Like my shoe size is like 12 and  are	sd	4
Compared to maybe somebody elses	Yeah	b	1
Alex	Hour	sd	4
Patrick	Me	sd	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Patrick	A variable	sd	4
Yes Brandon	So the numbers change not the uh letter	sd	4
Yes	Then like so you have like eight dollars could you go like eight and like B	sd	4
Jen	Therell be point fifty after seven	sd	4
Okay so seven point five H right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	I dont I didnt get it	sd	1
Which part	The uh the H seven H and then the four where do you get the four Ws to	sd	3
Youre going to an Eagles game	Oh	b	1
I used Phillies in my other classes but for you Tim I used Eagles	First the Raiders	sd	1
Theyre very good by the way in Philadelphia	So are the cheese steaks	sd	1
Marcus	N hot over three dollars	sd	4
Not over because that means divided	Three N	sd	4
Three N means however many I buy I have to pay three dollars for right	Where do you get the N from	sd	3
Jen	Wouldnt that mean you have to multiply them	sd	4
So if I got two hotdogs how much money am I spending	Six dollars	sd	4
Yes	Can it be like any letter	sd	1
Yes Michelle it can be	But isnt it confusing	sd	1
How much money are you going to make this week Ryan	Fourteen	sd	4
Josh	Seventy	sd	4
Michelle	Multiplied it by a seven	sd	4
Yes	So for the hotdog thing would the N be two	sd	4
We substituted two for the N	Oh	b	1
We evaluated that example	Do you have to write that then	sv	1
Do you have to write that then	Or can you just write like how like however many dollars it was times two	sd	4
This	Do you have to write the N or	sd	1
Well normally youll be given that yes	Okay	b	1
Marcus	I guess like four times two	sd	4
I guess like four times two	Four times two plus three would be eleven	sd	5
And remember if there is nothing in between a number and parenthesis what operation do we do	Multiplication	aa	4
Patrick	Multiplication	aa	4
Yes	So my answer to the question is four times two is eight plus three is	sd	4
Is 11	All right	aa	1
Social Studies class is three times as long as math	It is	sd	1
Because math class is fun Tim	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	Oh I get it	sd	1
Oh I get it	I just like math	sd	1
Theyre all the same but that was just an	I thought fifth period was the longest	sd	1
I thought fifth period was the longest	Yeah	b	1
Take numbers and change them into words	You can do one of those	sd	1
Im gonna give you an some examples	Wait	sd	1
Patrick	A plus negative three	sd	4
Im going to give you another Yes	Whyd you put the parenthesis around negative three	sd	3
If I put	Oh	b	1
Andrea	Do you have to put it down there	sd	1
Tim	Would it make a difference if we put it around N plus or not	sd	3
Marcus	What if you switched it around  negative three before	sd	3
Before N	Yeah	b	1
But its but Its backwards here from what the words are	Oh	b	1
Yes	So a number means like you put a letter	sd	4
Any letter	So that means oh	sd	1
Michelle	Six minus N	sd	4
Six minus N	N minus six	sd	4
Why do you think that	Oh because	sd	1
Tell me why	Six is less than the number	sd	4
Six less than a number	Oh	b	1
Alex	So then when it says less than in like a question you always minus the number from the letter	sd	4
So then when it says less than in like a question you always minus the number from the letter	Like go the letter minus the number	sd	4
Yes	Who did do you have to put the parenthesis around the minus six or would that be considered a negative six	sd	3
So Im going to give you this time Yes	Is this in the book too	sd	1
Jen	K over eight	sd	4
Thats Steve	K into eight	sd	4
That would be eight into K	Oh	b	1
Christy	K of eight	b	4
What does of mean in that	Oh	b	1
Fifteen minus B Patrick	Fifteen less than B	sd	4
Fifteen less than B	Or less B less than 15	aa	4
Andrea	What does quotient mean	sd	3
Alex	Uh says sub well take Substitute words and change them into numbers	sd	4
Do you remember back what order of operations means Jen	PEMDAS	sd	4
Whats that mean	Parenthesis exponent multiplication division and addition and subtraction	sd	4
And whats the saying that goes along with that	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
Jen	Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally	sd	4
Aubrey whats please mean	Oh parenthesis	aa	4
Whats that mean	Exponent	sd	4
My	Multiplication	aa	4
Dear	Division	b	4
Sally	Subtraction	aa	4
Patrick	You do the multiplication first	sd	5
You do the multiplication first	But put the you put 12 in for N and then you do the multiplication and then you add	sd	5
Alex	Or you could substitute N for 12 and put quotations around	sd	4
Parenthesis	Yeah parenthesis around N 12 so you know how to do those first	sd	4
Jen	What about for us in the example that says uh a number plus a negative three	sd	5
What about for us in the example that says uh a number plus a negative three	Wouldnt you have to do something with those parenthesis though cause thats the order of operations	sv	5
Marcus	I have a question	sd	3
I have a question	Is that one point five	sd	1
So Patrick said put 12 N for N Class whats two times 12	Twentyfour	sd	4
Plus one point five gives us twentyfive point five	Is this all in our notes	sd	1
Is this all in our notes	Yes	b	1
Michelle	Write a variable expression for each quantity	sd	1
Write a variable expression for each quantity	Explain what the variable represents	sd	1
Steve	Like N N minus negative six	sd	4
No just N minus six	N minus six	sd	4
What does N represent	Her moms height	sd	1
Patrick	Uh C times three	sd	4
Or how else could you say that	Three times C	sd	4
Andrea	Three C	sd	4
Ryan	Three X	sd	4
Think think about that one again	Plus X	aa	4
So what would it be	Three plus X	sd	4
Whats X represent	Jill	sd	1
Alex	N two	sd	4
Quotient of three divided by W Marcus	W over three	sd	4
W over three	Or three over W	sd	4
Michelle	N minus 17	sd	4
Im going to pass out your homework	Oh do we on our homework uh	sd	1
Patrick	When youre trying to figure out all the problems	sv	1
Steve	When youre trying to figure out like how much something weighs	sd	4
Okay	Yeah	b	1
How about Yes Patrick	Very good	sd	4
Jen	When youre trying to find the price of clothes or something	sd	4
Yes	Like in science like when you try try to find density	sd	4
Andrea	Page 64 from workbook Xerox copy numbers one to 22 do all of them	sd	1
Page 64 from workbook Xerox copy numbers one to 22 do all of them	And a quiz on Friday	sd	1
Yes	For number one through 16 you dont have to write the answer	sd	1
It doesnt say evaluate	Oh yeah	b	1
Yeah just write the expression	Theres an extra	sd	1
Thank you John	On uh on number one do you have to have do you have to put the number before you uh subtraction	sd	1
So like	So it would be like five subtract uh any number you any letter you want to	sd	4
Yes	On number two it says the absolute value do you have to put the lines in	sd	1
What do you think	Yes	b	1
Yes	But do you like put an N	sd	4
Yes	For number five do you have to put two expressions because it says uh says three more than the product	sd	5
What would the product of eight and a number be	So wouldnt it be like X	sd	4
Okay	So What should I use	sd	3
Please John please work	So then eight and equals	sd	4
Because thats three more than	Okay	b	1
Marcus	I have a question on like number three	sd	3
Josh whats your question	How do you solve this	qy	3
What does product mean	Multiplication	aa	4
Okay so how would you do that	Uh	b	1
Uh	I dont know	sd	1
What are you multiplying here	Negative eight	sd	4
Negative eight	A number	sd	4
Okay so how would we do that	Negative eight N	sd	4
Good	All right	aa	1
Very good	Whats the answer	sd	3
Yes	All right I have no clue what to put first	sd	3
What does product mean	Like the answer to a number	sd	4
What kind of operation are we using for product	Multiplication	aa	4
So what are we multiplying here	Uh negative eight	sd	4
Uh negative eight	Negative eight and P And the product of	sd	4
Negative eight and P And the product of	So is it negative eight	sd	4
Times	P So negative	sd	4
Alex do you have a question	sum of the quarters	sd	4
Okay	It would be	sd	1
How much is a quarter	Twentyfive cents	sd	4
So how do we represent that in numbers	Point twentyfive	sd	4
Okay	So it would be N 25 or	sd	4
Point two five N	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yes	b	1
Yes	Right here	aa	1
Right here	So if its five less than a number would it be five subtract X	sd	4
X is the number so it has to be the other way	Oh	b	1
Oh	So it up here it would be 15 more than how do I So it would be X plus 15	sd	4
Just make sure you put it in absolute value of the box	Oh so thats good	ba	1
Oh so thats good	So fifteens got to be in the box	sd	4
Yeah no the number does	What number	sd	3
Any va any variable that you use	Oh so it would be uh the box then X then plus 15	sd	4
Yes	And then down	sd	1
Okay please listen	Give me my magazine	sd	1
Give me my magazine	Give me my magazine	sd	1
We have about three minutes	start	sd	1
start	No I almost	sd	1
Class were going to finish by playing 24	I get to go first	sd	1
I get to go first	No you dont	qy	1
Please finish your homework assignment and have it tomorrow	All right	aa	1
All right	Eight two five and seven	sd	1
Carly	Two times five equals 10	sd	5
Two times five equals 10	Ten minus seven equals three	sd	5

I had nine that s not fair	Tim got one	sd	1
He had his hand up	Cheater Jen	sd	1
Cheater Jen	Cheater Jen	sd	1
Cheater Jen	Thats his second one	sd	1
Thats his second one	Write the same one	sd	1
Write the same one	Say it out loud	sd	1
Say it out loud	Three nine three two and then seven	sd	1
Nine three two seven	Got it	sd	1

Uh nine Wait a minute	Yeah nine plus seven	sd	4
Yeah nine plus seven	Oh my	aa	1
Ill see you tomorrow	Its the same one	sd	1
Its the same one	Nine plus three equals  the same one	sd	4
And I will tell you that there will be more than one number that might work here but remember that whatever number you put in the first box what do you have to do	Put it in the rest of them	sd	4
Good	Oh I got it	sd	1
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	sd	1
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	sd	1
What	Six times six	sd	4
Okay hum let s get the paper passed out and let s try that	That s not true	sd	1
That s not true	Yes it is	sd	2
Yes it is	Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is thirty	sd	5
Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is thirty	No it s impossible that s wrong	sd	2
No it s impossible that s wrong	Yeah that s right	aa	2
Yeah that s right	That s one of the ways	sd	2
That s one of the ways	I told you	aa	2
I told you	Oh shut up	aa	1
Oh shut up	It doesn t work	sd	2
It doesn t work	Why don t you pass the paper down	sd	1
Does work or doesn t work	Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	sd	4
Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	There are two different numbers	sd	2
There are two different numbers	Two different numbers	sd	2
Six doesn t work okay	No two	sd	4
No two	A couple different can go	sd	4
A couple different can go	No	sd	2
No	No	sd	2
No	Doesn t it have to be all one number have to be in every box	sd	2
Doesn t it have to be all one number have to be in every box	Yes the same number has to be	sd	2
Yes the same number has to be	But there is two different possible answers though	sd	2
But there is two different possible answers though	I think I got it I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I got it	sd	1
Michelle	Yeah	b	1
Everybody agrees with that	Oh I don t want it to be right	sd	1
Matt can you show that	I have a different number	sd	2
I have a different number	I think it might work with three	sv	4
Yeah okay and	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Two and three work that works	sd	4
How much is that	Negative six	sd	4
How much is that	Plus the six would be zero	sd	4
Plus the six would be zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Yes	aa	2
Yes	Thank You	aa	1
And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	True	aa	4
True	That was three	sd	4
Do I put the two here or here	No three wouldn t work	sd	4
No three wouldn t work	In the brackets	sd	2
It goes in the truth set that makes it true	Let s try three now	sd	4
Let s try three now	Three	sd	2
Now various people are saying three	Three is not going to work	sd	4
You say three you say three  it works	It is	sd	4
It is	It works	aa	4
It works	Three is going to work	sd	2
Three is going to work	I m just thinking don t	sd	1
I m just thinking don t	No	b	2
No	It works	aa	2
It works	It works	aa	2
So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that	Negative six	sd	4
That is negative six but we are not through then it says plus six how much is that	Zero	sd	4
Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false	It s true	aa	4
Okay well I ve got some of these that I made up that I am wondering if I can get any of them cause they re so hard that none of you can do them	How about if we make something and have it like be impossible	sd	4
Not even Michelle not anybody not Ankur not Milin no one not anybody	Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	sd	5
Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	If it s impossible forget it	sd	2
If it s impossible forget it	The first one is easy	sd	2
The first one is easy	It s right up there	aa	2
It s right up there	Do we write both of them	sd	1
Okay	Should we go onto the next one	sd	1
You may as well	Didn t we do this one already	sd	1
Erik you were going to say something	Well see if someone was to look at this for the first time on the third number  line for the first time I know when I did I got confused because I thought that in  the middle of the section where she put the one third two thirds and three thirds	sd	5
Well see if someone was to look at this for the first time on the third number  line for the first time I know when I did I got confused because I thought that in  the middle of the section where she put the one third two thirds and three thirds	I thought that that is where they would be	sd	5
I thought that that is where they would be	So thats why	sd	5
So thats why	I think that is what  Michael did too	sv	2
I think that is what  Michael did too	So that is why he asked the question	sd	2
So we all looked at it differently	I think what Erik means is that he thought Meredith was making a whole new  number line like she thought two thirds was the half	sd	2
I think what Erik means is that he thought Meredith was making a whole new  number line like she thought two thirds was the half	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	It looks confusing	sd	1
But that was not what she was doing was she	No	b	2
Alan what were you going to say	The way I thought when you divide it up into fractions then you have a line  going to the fraction but Meredith just put the fractions above the number line  without the line so that meant she was labeling the area	sd	5
Okay now in the particular region over here she has two thirds in this region see  where I am pointing	Yes	b	1
Between the one third and the two thirds in that region represent two thirds of the  line	It represent one third	sd	4
OK it represents one third How do you know that	Because the way you said that one segment	sd	5
Because the way you said that one segment	Well if you use  both those segments like the segment here to here that would be two thirds but  you said the segment here	sd	5
Well if you use  both those segments like the segment here to here that would be two thirds but  you said the segment here	It would be the two thirds the segment but it would  be only one segment	sd	5
Could you show me what represents two thirds what part of that line represents  two thirds	Right to there	aa	4
Right to there	That would represent two thirds	sd	4
What do you think	That is true	aa	2
How many of you agree with that	Right but what I think   Meredith was trying  to do was you see how it had one third and the one third being here	sd	2
Right but what I think   Meredith was trying  to do was you see how it had one third and the one third being here	She was  saying that she was labeling this to be the second third of   the line and labeling this to be the third third of the line	sd	2
She was  saying that she was labeling this to be the second third of   the line and labeling this to be the third third of the line	Alg	aa	1
Okay so where would you put three over three where would you write that  number if you were to write it on the number line	You are doing it the way Eriks talking about it you would   put one third over that area and you would put two thirds in   that area and three thirds in that area because this would be  representing one third   both of those would be two thirds and   three of those would be three thirds	sd	5
I see over here the  numbers zero  one third two thirds and one  Where would you put three thirds	If you put three thirds you would put it just in that big area because it would be	sd	5
If you put three thirds you would put it just in that big area because it would be	It would be right  there	sd	4
It would be right  there	Right that would be the mark of the three third  but all three of those are the  three thirds	sd	5
Right that would be the mark of the three third  but all three of those are the  three thirds	Meredith is saying right here that three thirds is right here she says that is one  three thirds in her perspective would be right here	sd	2
Meredith is saying right here that three thirds is right here she says that is one  three thirds in her perspective would be right here	No	b	2
Let us hear what Meredith has to say	But	sd	1
Let us hear what Meredith has to say	As I did over here I am saying this area here is three thirds	sd	4
As I did over here I am saying this area here is three thirds	I know but if someone were to look at this for the one time they would think  that would be one whole and that would be three thirds because you did not  label	sv	5
I know but if someone were to look at this for the one time they would think  that would be one whole and that would be three thirds because you did not  label	You should label one whole and under it put three thirds	sd	5
But I did hear Meredith say that this piece is three thirds did you mean that Meredith	Yeah this whole entire piece right here	sd	4
You mean that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And another thing Alan said	sd	1
And another thing Alan said	Well that is why I said	sd	1
Well that is why I said	I agree that would be the first piece	sd	5
I agree that would be the first piece	That is the second piece	sd	5
That is the second piece	But together they make twothirds	sd	5
And what makes three thirds	Entire thing	sd	4
Entire thing	Three thirds would be the entire thing it would go right  here if this is the third one third segment	sd	5
Three thirds would be the entire thing it would go right  here if this is the third one third segment	Right that is just representing the threethirds	sd	2
Right that is just representing the threethirds	Thats what I was talking about Alan I am talking about one section is one third  one section is two thirds like what Meredith said they are separate when you put  them together they are two thirds	sd	5
Brian	I know what Meredith is trying to say	sd	2
I know what Meredith is trying to say	She is trying to say to label between  it because if someone said if someone looks at it and they did not know a  thing about a number line they would probably think that the one third would be  between the one third and two thirds that is why she labeled it also in the middle  because if someone saw it and did not know what a number line was they would  probably think one third is between the one third mark and the two third mark so  she is just labeling it in the middle to make it less confusing	sd	5
Ok Amy and Jakki you were going to say something	and  Jakki	sd	1
You have a comment yes Mark	I agree with Bryan because if no one ever saw a  number line they would think that this was one third  and this was two thirds	sd	5
Alan	We could do that so that we could represent one half two thirds and   three thirds in pieces	sd	4
We could do that so that we could represent one half two thirds and   three thirds in pieces	Here is one way to  do it	sd	4
Here is one way to  do it	Now here would be one mark two marks	sd	5
Now here would be one mark two marks	Now you could  could take out one of those pieces and say it is one third	sd	5
What about zero	Zero would be put here	sd	4
Are there others	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I know I just did one	sd	1
You have another one	Yeah	b	1
I would like one that uh is the next smallest	Next sma	sd	1
Brian whats your prediction	I think it would be twentyfour	sd	4
What rods	Well the next the next the next larger one will be I think the  whole will be twentyfour	sd	4
But we we call the whole one	Yeah I know but what I mean	sd	1
Yeah I know but what I mean	No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole	sd	2
What would be what would be twentyfourths	Like the there would be there would take twentyfour white cubes  to equal up to a whole	sd	5
Like the there would be there would take twentyfour white cubes  to equal up to a whole	I I also have a strategy	sd	1
Wait wait a second youre saying twentyfour white ones would  equal your train	Yeah yeah	b	1
So then what would one white one  be called in that next model do you think	One twelfth	sd	4
One twelfth	I think um	sv	1
What would that white one be called	Well its not gonna were not gonna	sd	1
Well its not gonna were not gonna	Let me see this	sd	1
Let me see this	Um one twentyfourth I think	sd	4
You think that too	Yeah Alan and I made that same model	sd	5
Yeah Alan and I made that same model	We made the same model  that was I think it was two oranges and like one purple yeah it was  two oranges and one purple and then it had the thirds	sd	5
Is that what you  had	I made that also	sd	2
Ok can you leave the other one up there maybe  while youre making that	Sure we can	sd	1
James why dont you make the other one too so it doesnt go away  on the bottom	Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	sd	1
Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	2  more no  6 more	sd	4
I would suggest  you to make both models in your seats and keep them in front of  you	Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twentyfour  twentyfour here	sd	5
Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twentyfour  twentyfour here	Youve got twentyfour plus twentyfour is forty eight	sd	5
Youve got twentyfour plus twentyfour is forty eight	I need those	sd	1
I need those	I need another red	sd	1
I need another red	I need thirtysix whites	sd	1
I need thirtysix whites	Thirtysix	sd	2
Thirtysix	Why are you saying thirtysix	sd	3
Why are you saying thirtysix	I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	sd	1
I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	You can have all the reds you want	sd	1
You can have all the reds you want	Im going to sit here and watch  you guys	sd	1
Im going to sit here and watch  you guys	Were in battle	sd	1
I see that you built a model that has two oranges and a  purple that youre calling one	Well I imagine the white ones	sd	1
And youre imagining the whites and how many do you imagine  are there	Twentyfour	sd	4
And  how many do you have there Andrew	Um twentyfour whites	sd	4
But you built it too Amy how many  do you have Amy	Twentyfour	sd	4
Yes	Twentyfour	sd	4
Because  if youre not you may want to go up and count them to be sure or  go to someone else who built the model and count them	I I built the model	sd	1
Ok so Sarah  and Beth you built one you dont have enough	No	b	1
Ok do you believe there are  Sarah and  Beth	Yeah	b	1
That hes now going to give the white one the number name what  class	One twentyfourth	sd	4
We know  the white one has number name one twentyfourth in that model	Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the thirds	sd	4
Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the thirds	Yes mmm hmmm	sd	2
Yes mmm hmmm	And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths would  do it	sd	2
And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths would  do it	mmm hmmm	sd	2
mmm hmmm	So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is two  whites and then people think the twelfths would be the answer but  if you take two of the twentyfourths	sd	5
So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is two  whites and then people think the twelfths would be the answer but  if you take two of the twentyfourths	It would equal up to a red rod	sd	2
It would equal up to a red rod	It would equal up to a red rod	sd	2
It would equal up to a red rod	Which would be equal to twelfths	sd	2
Which would be equal to twelfths	Which would be one twelfth	sd	2
Which would be one twelfth	So see we think I think that the  answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	sd	4
So see we think I think that the  answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	Mmm hmmm	sd	2
How many of you agree with what they said	So there are two answers	sd	4
So there are two answers	Both the same	sd	4
Good morning class	Good morning Mr Leung	sd	1
Uh for last Friday I have asked you to prepare for this topic have you read over this chapter	Yes	b	1
PENTAGON	PENTAGON	sd	1
Pentagon	Pentagon	sd	1
What does it mean	Uh more than 180 degrees	sd	4
More more than 180 degrees	Yes	b	1
Okay that means uh this angle is more than 180 degrees	Yes	b	1
Can we find any angles more than 180 degrees	No	b	1
Okay can can you get the meaning of of of your thank you thank you your your classmate say	Yeah	b	1
Do you still remember it	Yes	b	1
All the sides	Are equal	sd	4
All the sizes of the angle	Are equal	sd	4
How how how do we call this kind of polygon	Square	b	4
Okay do you still remember the spelling	R	b	1
It is equal to	One hundred and eighty degrees	sd	4
The the abbreviation to describe such properties	Angle sum of triangle	sd	4
Uh is it done by you	No	b	1
You you you you have to uh uh do it by yourself	Okay	b	1
It is not done by you	Yes	b	1
It asks you to draw from vertex A to vertices C and D how many triangles are formed	Three	sd	4
What is the sum of the angles in each triangle	One hundred	sd	4
One hundred and 80 degrees	Eighty degrees	sd	1
These three triangles	Five	sd	4
Five hundred and forty degrees	Five hundred and forty degrees	sd	1
It becomes	Five 540 degrees	sd	4
Ok hw many  think you know the answer to that some of you have built a James	aren t really sure	sd	1
What do you think	I think its one sixth	sv	4
You think the white is one sixth	Yeah	b	1
Okay so James isn t sure but he thinks its one sixth Brian	Is it one twelfth	sd	4
Brian thinks its one twelfth	One tenth	sd	4
Okay what s the number name for the white when  you have an orange and red	Yo yo	aa	1
Yo yo	One sixth	sd	4
One sixth	Count the ones	sd	2
Count the ones	No We re working with orange and red	sd	2
No We re working with orange and red	No We re working with that	sd	2
No We re working with that	We re working with that model	sd	4
Orange and red is one	We are working with orange and red	sd	4
We are working with orange and red	Oh Orange and red	sd	5
Oh Orange and red	Then it s twelve	sd	5
Then it s twelve	One twelfth	sd	4
He thinks he s  going to argue for why he s changing his mind	Okay	b	1
If we call the orange and red one	Now I think it might be one twelfth cause orange and orange and  red equals twelve white ones	sd	5
Now I think it might be one twelfth cause orange and orange and  red equals twelve white ones	So umm	sd	1
It s hard  let me help you by holding this still	And its one twelfth cause there s one two three four five six seven  eight nine ten eleven twelve	sd	5
Thank you James	Well um a dark green is half of one orange I mean orange and red  and then the dark green has six blocks six whites and if you have  two dark greens six and six is twelve	sd	5
Well um a dark green is half of one orange I mean orange and red  and then the dark green has six blocks six whites and if you have  two dark greens six and six is twelve	And that s why we think its  twelve	sd	5
But I heard Sarah something even different than that	Umm I said that umm you have six of these reds	sd	5
Umm I said that umm you have six of these reds	If you times these  by two you d get twelve	sd	5
If you times them by two why would you times them by two Sara	Because if you had if you put two next two little ones right on the  bottom of the red it would equal two	sd	5
Because if you had if you put two next two little ones right on the  bottom of the red it would equal two	So you would go two times	sd	5
Can t why	Um	b	1
Who thinks they can write about them two different ways and why  Kelly	I think I can write about them because now I understand which or  how is what one goes cause now there s not just one different kind  there s all different kinds	sd	1
Anybody else what to say why he or she thinks Brian	Well I understand the problem and I feel that I can write about it	sd	1
Both of the models	Well not both of them but the one the twelfth I can write about it	sd	1
What do you mean the one twelfth Brian	The twelfths the twelve of them equal the red and the orange rod	sd	4
Good morning	Good morning	sd	1
Amanda	That there would be   school on Saturday	sd	4
Krishna	We ll get older	sd	4
Jessie	The A s will win tonight	sd	4
Do you guys know	They did win	sd	1
They did win	They won	sd	1
Ivan	We were trying to figure out whether to put it on likely or equally likely	sd	4
Why was that	Because since the A s are a stronger team than the other team they were playing that night so we were thinking that maybe it would be   actually   wait	sd	5
Because since the A s are a stronger team than the other team they were playing that night so we were thinking that maybe it would be   actually   wait	Actually equally likely and likely because we were thinking   since A s is the stronger team it might   they might like win since it s stronger than the other team that they were playing that night	sd	5
Josh	Someone who in this class would change their name	sd	4
Abir	That we will have science lab	sd	4
Is it okay to put it anywhere on the likelihood line	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Yes	No	b	2
Zarra	Anywhere because you can t   it can be in the middle cause you never know	sd	5
Okay go	Maybe it snows once	sd	4
What did you decide	It never snows in some places	sd	4
How about Devon	We all agreed that   we all agreed that we should put it like in the middle of these two but closer to impossible because it s not totally impossible that it might snow but it s really unlikely cause we have warm weather	sd	5
Devon did you   you all agreed is that what you said	Yeah	b	1
Brandon come on up	I will put it near   I will put it in the middle but a little bit more to unlikely because even though it doesn t snow in Fremont it snows in some   some parts of California and we all agreed on that	sd	5
Is that what you agreed Jonathan	I thought we all agreed to possible	sd	2
Jonathan why don t you   why don t you just take the pointer from Brandon and show him what you thought you understood why you guys were discussing it cause it sounds like you guys have a little bit of different understanding	I thought we agreed to do impossible cause we   it   it never snows here	sd	5
I thought we agreed to do impossible cause we   it   it never snows here	Like he said it does snow in some parts of California	sd	2
What do you think	Impossible	aa	4
There s no right or wrong answer here	Lean towards Jonathan	sd	2
Why do you think it should go there	Cause sometimes kids are absent and most of the time they are here	sd	5
Do you agree with that	I think it should go between	sv	4
Tell me your group agreed with you or   thought differently and Areesh	We decided in between equally likely and likely because it s spring and a lot of like   there s allergies   people could get allergies could be sick and be absent	sd	5
We decided in between equally likely and likely because it s spring and a lot of like   there s allergies   people could get allergies could be sick and be absent	So we put it inbetween equally likely and likely	sd	5
Did you all kind of agree with that or	We agreed	sd	2
Go ahead and pass it to whomever you d like	I think that it could be fiftyfifty because   well mostly now we aren t getting anybody that s absent and sometimes we do get absents	sd	5
I think that it could be fiftyfifty because   well mostly now we aren t getting anybody that s absent and sometimes we do get absents	But now we re not mostly getting absent students so it could be fifty fifty cause we never know like today we don t have anybody absent and tomorrow we might have someone absent	sd	5
Okay go ahead and take one and pass that back	We don t have a spelling pretest this week	sd	1
I m hearing people whisper what is it	Zero	sd	4
Samuel said   Samuel go ahead you have your hand in the air	Well I think I know the rest	sd	1
Okay why don t you tell me   what you re thinking the number would be for certain	A hundred	aa	4
A hundred what	Percent	sd	4
What do you mean by a hundred percent	For sure	sd	4
Okay so what does a hundred percent mean to you	It WILL happen	sd	4
Inderneil	Half	sd	4
Tell me what you re thinking with half	Like fifty is half cause a hundred percent and a hundred percent is full	sd	5
Does fifty percent and one half mean the same	Yes	b	1
Josh	I would say twenty percent	sd	4
Okay why would you say twenty percent	I would say twenty percent because   twenty percent because	sd	4
Are you changing your mind	I m still thinking twenty percent but I just don t know how to put it why	sd	4
Joshua why don t you call on someone in the room to help you out with this	Brandon	aa	1
Brandon	I know the answer though	sd	1
Go ahead	It s twenty five percent because if   I thought if I can count from the inside   from inside each will equal up to twenty and then the lines represent every five so   five ten fifteen twenty and then twenty five goes on the line	sd	5
Broken up into four spaces	Yes	b	1
What do you think Josh	Yeah	b	1
Twenty five percent	I know another way too	sd	1
I know another way too	You just subtract twentyfive off of all of them	sd	5
You just subtract twentyfive off of all of them	So likely it s gonna be I m not gonna say the answer though	sd	1
Can you clarify that for us	So one hundred minus twentyfive is seventyfive	sd	5
So everybody what are we gonna put here	Seventy five	sd	4
Seventyfive	Percent	sd	4
There s actually more than one way to write it but   Abir	Three fourths	sd	4
Nakila	One fourth	sd	4
I d like to put the vocabulary down as well	Are percentages related to fractions	sd	4
Why don t you copy that down too	Instead of 50100 s can I put 510s	sd	4
Show me which	Can I put 510s instead of 50100s	sd	4
So how many tiles are in here	Ten	sd	4
What you got	Green	sd	1
Okay	Green	sd	1
How about Tarin	Green	sd	1
Do you think it s unlikely equally likely or likely I m gonna pull a yellow tile out of the bag	Equal	b	4
Equal	Unlikely	sd	2
Unlikely	Equally likely	sd	2
Why are you thinking equally likely Hafasta	Cause it s fifty fifty	sd	5
Cause it s fifty fifty	It might happen and it might not	sd	2
Marcus	Unlikely because there was more greens pulled out than yellows	sd	5
What did you get	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	First yellow tile	sd	1
Green	Green	sd	1
What about over here	Green	sd	1
How many tiles did we say I had in the bag	Ten	sd	4
How many times total have we drawn a tile out of the bag	Ten	sd	4
How many yellow tile and how many green tiles you think I have in this bag	Five green Six green and four yellow	sd	2
Five green Six green and four yellow	No I think seven greens and three yellows	sd	2
Why do you think seven greens and three yellows Robert	Cause it s on the board	sd	1
Jonathan what are you thinking	Somebody somebody could have pulled out the same tile that somebody else already	sd	4
Abir	I think that there s six green and four yellows	sv	4
Go ahead	That s all	sd	1
Hafasa	I guessed that there s seven   seven green and three yellows	sd	4
Do you all agree with that	Yeah	b	2
can you   can you tell me why	Because on the chart it says seven greens I mean yeah seven greens and three yellows	sd	5
Jonathan can I get you back up to do some more recording for me	I did it already	sd	1
Yellow	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	Green	sd	1
Green	Green	sd	1
Green	Green	sd	1
Green	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	Green	sd	1
Green	Green	sd	1
Is it likely equally likely or unlikely that we re gonna pull a yellow out of the bag	Likely	sd	1
Likely	Unlikely	sd	2
Unlikely	Equally likely	sd	2
Sarab	Likely	sd	4
Likely	Likely that we ll pull a green	sd	4
So what do you think about pulling about pulling a yellow	In the middle of the likely and equally likely	sd	4
Could it be impossible	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Could it be impossible that we re gonna pull a yellow	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	2
No	If you take out all the yellows then it s impossible to take out to a yellow	sd	2
Would it be impossible on the next draw	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
Is there anybody in the class who thinks it s impossible that we could draw a yellow on the next draw	In the middle of unlikely and impossible	sd	4
In the middle of unlikely and impossible	Well because	sd	1
Well because	Like   there s more greens than yellow so	sd	5
Like   there s more greens than yellow so	I m thinking that   I m thinking there s more greens that there is yellow	sv	5
So you re thinking more towards the impossible but you re not thinking totally impossible	Yeah	b	1
Let s take a few more draws	Yellow	sd	1
It s all right	Green	sd	1
All right we ll take one more	Green	sd	1
How many times did we sample   pull a sample out of the bag	Twenty three	sd	4
How many greens and how many yellows	What were the last 3 draws	sd	3
Do you remember what the last 3 draws were	I just wanted to do the math	sd	1
I just wanted to do the math	If you take away the last three draws you have twenty	sd	5
If you take away the last three draws you have twenty	Take away the last 3 draws you would have twenty	sd	2
Take away the last 3 draws you would have twenty	Thirteen and seven	sd	2
Thirteen and seven	I would say that there would be more so estimated but then you can t divide them by two	sd	2
Why do you have thirteen and seven	Thirteen are the greens	sd	5
And now what do you think	If I just made this one more I would say there would be seven greens	sd	5
If I just made this one more I would say there would be seven greens	Seven greens and three yellows in the bag	sd	2
What makes you say that	Either seventhree or sixfour	sd	4
But you wanted to work with twenty	Yeah	b	1
Why would	It s just an easier number	sd	4
Sarab	I m changing it to six greens and four yellows	sd	4
Do you remember	Seven greens and three yellows	sd	4
And why are you changing	Cause	sd	1
Cause	Well cause yellows are like on a winning streak	sd	5
What do you mean	Like I think five   a lot of yellows were drawn but there were only a few more greens were drawn	sd	5
Okay so when we sampled again you saw more yellows than when we sampled the first time	In the middle of equally likely	sd	4
Yes	I think that there s five greens and five yellows because it could have been that people were repicking the green picking the yellow cause there might be five of each and plus five goes into ten equally	sd	5
Josh	I would say eight greens and two yellows	sd	4
I would say eight greens and two yellows	Because even though more yellows were picked that doesn t meant that there s more yellows than green	sd	5
Hafasa	Have you decided that it was five and five cause you said that there was ten tiles in the paper bag and five and five equals ten and when we picked out more cause we   we didn t   we put them back them in you told them to pick out more	sd	5
So you re agreeing with this	Five and five	sd	4
What do we got	One yellow	sd	1
One yellow	One green	sd	1
One green	Another green	sd	1
Another green	Two green	sd	1
Two green	Three green	sd	1
Three green	Four green	sd	1
Four green	Five green	sd	1
Five green	Six green	sd	1
So how many yellows	Two Four	sd	4
That s what we have so far	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	I won the lotto	sd	1
I won the lotto	Yellow	sd	1
Yellow	Yeah	b	1
This one right here	Twenty five red and five blues	sd	4
Twenty five red and five blues	The blue lost	sd	2
R stands for	Red	sd	1
And B stands for	Blue	sd	1
Are they mixed up	Yup	aa	1
Red	Blue	sd	1
There s a lot more reds	There s a lot more reds	sd	1
Who can tell me why you think we need to do some more drawing	Because none of the answers on the chart are up there	sd	5
Indraneil	Well because it s like   you don t have enough information yet to   it could be any of them	sd	5
Well because it s like   you don t have enough information yet to   it could be any of them	Because some are unlikely but still unlikely   still it s not impossible though	sd	5
Because some are unlikely but still unlikely   still it s not impossible though	I think we need to draw some more to find out what more information to find them out	sd	2
We ll do one more	Six more	sd	4
Keep going	That way we can have thirty	sd	5
Red	Last one	sd	1
What are you thinking Samuel	Something s wrong	sd	4
What s wrong	I was   I was   me and Joshua were against each other   I was thinking that inside this bag there are twenty five red and five blue	sd	4
He was thinking twenty red and ten blue	It exceeded twenty and it exceeded five	sd	4
Samuel s confused	I m kind of confused too   but still   I still think it s twenty red and ten blues cause it   right now it s twenty two and   if kept on going and she picked three more reds it could still be twenty red and ten blue because it s like   it could be   she could pick another red twice or something	sd	5
Why don t you turn around sweetie	I don t get it	sd	3
I think I heard you say that it s possible that we could have drawn	More reds	sd	4
More reds	Like   the same red like	sd	2
More More than one time	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Sam	Yes	b	1
Areesh	I want to say something	sd	1
Go ahead	I think that twenty red and ten blue because if you round the red tiles it would be twenty closer to twenty and if you round the blue tiles it would be closest to ten	sd	5
Okay	I don t think so	sd	2
I don t think so	S I don t think so	sd	2
S I don t think so	I didn t choose any of them	sd	2
I didn t choose any of them	I don t know	sd	3
You re still you re just not sure	I didn t choose any of them	sd	1
Do you have a guess or do you have a comment or a question you want to ask us	No	b	1
Let s do it	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Go ahead	Red	sd	1
You guys are making estimates already huh	Red	sd	1
Red	Blue	sd	1
Blue	Yeah finally	b	1
Yeah finally	Blue	sd	1
Blue	Blue	sd	1
Blue	Red	sd	1
You okay	Red	sd	1
Okay	My arm is starting to hurt	sd	1
Okay we can   we can stop and take our guest now or we can keep going what are you guys gonna do	Keep going	sd	4
Amanda	Cause we re not sure yet on what estimate   if we   and if we keep on getting red we might get a better guess of what the answer is	sd	5
Krishna	The last one twenty five red and five blues	sd	4
Is there anybody in the room Samuel or Robert is it important do you think that we keep going to thirty or can we stop to make our prediction	Keep going	sd	4
Are you just not sure	I m just not sure	sd	3
Robert how about you	Because we don t know the answer yet	sd	5
Okay we don t know the answer yet so we have to get to thirty to get to get the answer	Yes	b	1
Go ahead	But then I don t think we have to go all the way to thirty because since we have fifteen and we got   got like   we have enough information because if you multiply both the rows by two then you ve gone to a total of thirty because fifteen   there are fifteen draws in all times two will make thirty draws and you can multiply by two   both sides by two because it would   it would make like a repetition since it s already that much	sd	5
So what I m hearing you say is that if we   we re at fifteen draws	Yeah	b	1
So if we just multiply this number by two and we just multiply this number by two	We ll find the answer	sd	4
Devon	Because if you can if you multiply three by two that s six	sd	5
Because if you can if you multiply three by two that s six	I know but that s close	sd	2
I know but that s close	That s pretty close to   that would be twentyfour and six and that s pretty close to twentyfive and five	sd	2
That s pretty close to   that would be twentyfour and six and that s pretty close to twentyfive and five	You can estimate it up to that	sd	2
You can estimate it up to that	I agree	aa	2
I agree	Keep going	sd	2
Let s see what   sorry Sarab keep going	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
Red	Blue	sd	1
Blue	Red	sd	1
Red	Red	sd	1
How many do we have	Twenty reds and four blues	sd	4
Twenty reds and four blues	Twenty four	sd	2
Red	Red	sd	1
Do we need one more	One more	sd	4
One more	One more	sd	2
Two	Red	sd	1
Red	That s the same thing	sd	4
That s the same thing	Twentysix and four	sd	2
Not sure and that s okay	Well I think when we guess of which combination is up there on the board twentyfive red and five blue is because	sd	5
Well I think when we guess of which combination is up there on the board twentyfive red and five blue is because	It just   well twenty four and six are two is	sd	5
It just   well twenty four and six are two is	Well   I have it in my mind but it s   it won t come out of my tongue	sd	1
Do you want another minute to think about it or do you want to call on somebody to	I want to call on somebody to help	sd	1
Okay go ahead	Josh	sd	1
Josh	Well like I said the last time they   there could have been like twenty   more reds could have been pulled like again	sd	5
Well like I said the last time they   there could have been like twenty   more reds could have been pulled like again	Like   there   like	sd	1
Like   there   like	Two  like a red could have been pulled twice like I said last time	sd	2
Is it possible that a lot of tiles were picked up more than once	Yes	b	1
Yes	Some tiles are picked once	sd	4
What do you think s in this bag everybody	twentyfive red and five blues	sd	4
So could you quickly get out your Math books	Excuse me	sd	1
Hafasa do you have a question	Ten eleven plus thirteen	sd	4
Ten eleven and thirteen might be   let me see	Next page	sd	1
Any questions you have for me	No	b	1
Great let s   oh go ahead	How come we re not doing number twelve	sd	1
You can   you re welcome to give number twelve a shot if you want	Extra credit	sd	1
Can you give me an example of what a prime number is	Like three times one is three	sd	5
Like three times one is three	It s one that you can t divide	sd	2
Yeah	Ms Thornley	sd	1
Ms Thornley	Can we eat our snacks right now	sd	1
Why don t you work with your partner and see if you can  figure it out	Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we have the  three thirds and we then the half	sd	4
And what we supposed to figure out after we did that	Which is bigger a half or two thirds	sd	3
Is it still the same or does it change when your  model changes	Two thirds is still bigger	sd	4
How  many do you think	Eighteen	sd	4
So how much larger	It s bigger	sd	4
It s bigger	One eighteenth	sd	4
My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over there	It was bigger by one one sixth	sd	4
This is  different from the other one or the same	It s different in a way and it s the same in a way	sd	5
How s it different and how s it the same	Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s different  because um this one it only ta the little box are only um two three  four there s only six of them and here s there s eighteen and this  the thirds are bigger by three eighteenths	sd	5
You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three eighteenths	and the two thirds over here is bigger by one sixth	sd	5
Ok Danielle what do you think about this time	Well um two thirds	sd	4
Can you build a two thirds and a one half for  him separate so we can then compare	Here s the two thirds and here s the half	sd	4
What s the difference	and it s bigger by two twelfths	sd	5
and it s bigger by two twelfths	It s  um it s bigger by two twelfths	sd	5
How are the answers I don t understand what do you think  about this	One two three	sd	1
Over here it was how much	This one was bigger by three eighteenths	sd	5
And this one	Was bigger by  how much	sd	3
Was bigger by  how much	Two twelfths	ba	4
Two twelfths	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve	sd	1
And your original one was	It was bigger by one sixth	sd	5
Oh so what do you think	I think they re all different but then all the same	sd	5
I think they re all different but then all the same	Cause they re the  same because the thirds are always bigger than the half	sd	5
The two thirds are always bigger than the half	And um and they re different because these are all the whites	sd	5
And um and they re different because these are all the whites	they re different sizes	sd	2
they re different sizes	They re all different like one two uh three they re different	sd	5
They re all different like one two uh three they re different	So  they re different like that	sd	5
Or this difference  here	You could use a light green	sd	1
What would that be	That would be one That would be one sixth	sd	4
And what did you say it was over here with the little one	Um that s one sixth	sd	4
So if you used the light green	It could be one sixth	sd	4
And if you used the whites	It would be three eighteenths	sd	4
What about for this one	What problem	sd	1
Uh Gregory I want you to watch and see if you agree with  what Danielle is doing here	And then  that would be one sixth too	sd	4
Mmm over each of  em	That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that one would  be one sixth	sd	4
But you have had two two different names for the answer if you did  it this way it was	It was two twelfths	sd	4
And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had the  three what was the name for that one	Three eighteenths	sd	4
Are you all as awake as I am	Yeah	b	1
Does anyone remember Andrew	Um is onehalf bigger uh is one half bigger than one fourth  by how much	sd	1
Is your hand up  Audra	No	b	1
Do you  remember Meredith	Um what s bigger one half or one quarter and by how  much	sd	4
Did you all build the same  model	No	b	1
To answer that question	No no	ba	1
Erik	Some of us built the same models and some of us built  different	sd	2
Erik	Could you get different answers	sd	4
Could you get different answers	Using barred models	sd	2
Using barred models	if you use different models	sd	2
Michael have you been thinking about that a little bit	Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that  we got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth  because it will always take two it will always take four  quarters to equal up	sd	5
Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that  we got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth  because it will always take two it will always take four  quarters to equal up	Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it  by two	sd	5
Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it  by two	In half	sd	2
In half	So there will always be one fourth and two fourths three  fourths four fourths and two fourths is always going to be a  half a half in fourths	sd	5
What are you why are you smiling about  Mark	Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	sd	5
Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	I made the sea  monster bigger than the boat	sd	5
Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat	No	b	1
What about the boat and the children	Those too	sd	4
Those too	The children are bigger	sd	4
No	Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of  just the boat	sd	2
Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of  just the boat	Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look  bigger like youre looking at the children not the boat	sd	2
Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look  bigger like youre looking at the children not the boat	like he doesnt he just put the boat in	sd	2
Yeah	Cause theyre at the dock	sd	5
Cause theyre at the dock	Yeah but he wasnt just focusing  on the boat	sd	5
What would you expect if you were really  worrying about the size you had two children at a dock and  you have a boat and you have a fish now we re not going to  go with sea monsters	Uh the boats the biggest	sd	4
Do you agree	Mm hmm	sd	2
okay	And then the children um and then the fish	sd	4
You all agree with that	Um hmm	sd	2
Would you  all make the same model	No	b	2
What wouldnt change about all of your models Beth	Wed have the same idea	sd	4
And whats that idea that would be the same	That two people fish and and the boat	sd	4
Because we have that here	Their sizes are the boats biggest and then the children	sd	4
Meredith	Well maybe not because everybody cant have the same  because they dont have theyre not like copying each other	sd	5
some of you might use little  dolls or something right or bigger dolls or	You re not measuring the same	sd	4
And if somebody came in  now with a fish bigger than the boy  that would  have missed the point right	No because a fish could be bigger than a boy	sd	5
Would it look different	Yes	b	1
Would the relationships that youre suppose to show  change	No	b	1
Well it depends on how big the fish is	It would look like a shrimp	sd	4
Graham	Well it wouldnt fit	sd	4
And what  would happen Meredith	Well you could put the Audras fish and you could put  Danielles fish into Audras box because it s small and it  could fit in	sd	5
It could be a shrimp	but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small	sd	5
So in this  case if if your one is going to be the size of this little stage if  you like  your players are made the boy  the girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it	Mm hmm	sd	1
Isnt that right	Yup	aa	1
Would you expect it to work if  your	Maybe maybe	sd	1
So tell me what you re thinking	Well your old model say your old model you decided it was  too little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	sv	5
Well your old model say your old model you decided it was  too little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	So you  make a bigger model and you try to take the fish from that  little model because you decide that you dont want to make  another one you put it in and you wouldnt be able to see it  there	sv	5
Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a  different model that her fish was smaller than the people and  smaller than the boat	Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish	sd	4
But should those relationships hold	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	aa	1
Yeah is that right	Yeah	b	1
Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he  were trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be  smaller than the people than the boat	Yeah	b	1
So in each of your models would have those relationships  holding right	Yeah	b	1
But they wouldnt all be built the same way and they wouldnt  all be the same size	So it d be its standard that the fish would be smaller than the  boat and the people except the fish would be different sized  and the people different sized and the boat different sized	sd	5
Is that like what youre doing when you make models  to compare fractions	Yeah	b	1
Meredith	Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right  then youre going to wind up with the same answer and some  of the models could be bigger and some of them could be  smaller	sd	5
What do you think the question is	Um is the mod is different models bigger than others and  um	sd	4
Do you want to say that one more time	You can use different models that are theyre the same	sd	4
Lets see what Audra thinks  the question is and then we can hear from those of you who  can try to help	Its that we um its about ah there are different  sizes of just like the candy bar that we did before	sd	5
Its that we um its about ah there are different  sizes of just like the candy bar that we did before	Um you  were asking um if we thought what sizes can fit into each  box what sizes should be that we are going to get confused  that the fish can fit into a box	sd	5
What do you think the question is	Im not sure	sd	1
Go ahead Erik give it a try  because we also have some people coming in	It has to do with the model that Mark made	sd	2
It has to do with the model that Mark made	Can the fish the  fish should be smaller than the people in the boat but the  people should be bigger than the boat or no they should be  bigger than the fish but they shouldnt be bigger than the  boat either	sd	4
Can the fish the  fish should be smaller than the people in the boat but the  people should be bigger than the boat or no they should be  bigger than the fish but they shouldnt be bigger than the  boat either	And how does that how do those models help us understand the models were building	sd	3
Michael do you want to add to that	Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller  than the people and the people have to be smaller than the  boat cause the people have to go in the boat and the people  have to be able to pull the fish out of the water and if it was  bigger than it they might have a little trouble getting it out	sd	5
Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller  than the people and the people have to be smaller than the  boat cause the people have to go in the boat and the people  have to be able to pull the fish out of the water and if it was  bigger than it they might have a little trouble getting it out	So um so then um its sort of like so that just  helps us understand what we re talking about with the  Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to  make different sized um halves and quarters um but  they re basically you can call it the same thing as you would  then just the small one with the small one if you call the box  a whole and the boat a half it would equal a quarter	sd	5
So um so then um its sort of like so that just  helps us understand what we re talking about with the  Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to  make different sized um halves and quarters um but  they re basically you can call it the same thing as you would  then just the small one with the small one if you call the box  a whole and the boat a half it would equal a quarter	You  could still do that in Audras model or any box	sd	5

Would it still work	Yeah	b	1
You re sure it would work	Just like we did	sd	1
Just like we did	Two after the other can be third	sd	4
By the way which is bigger	Ok We figured out by taking out	sd	1
Ok We figured out by taking out	Because if you have we figured that well let me just see  right here both models we have the halves and the thirds	sd	5
Because if you have we figured that well let me just see  right here both models we have the halves and the thirds	Like it was like the other problem it was one half and one  third	sd	5
Like it was like the other problem it was one half and one  third	And we explained it we said that one half was bigger  than one third but smaller than two thirds	sd	5
And we explained it we said that one half was bigger  than one third but smaller than two thirds	Like up here  there s one half right there and there s the thirds there s the  second third	sd	5
Like up here  there s one half right there and there s the thirds there s the  second third	One sixth	sd	4
But one half and two thirds	One oh that s exactly that s exactly what we meant	sd	1
One oh that s exactly that s exactly what we meant	These  are two thirds and that s one half	sd	4
These  are two thirds and that s one half	With one of the thirds it would be a sixth	sd	5
With one of the thirds it would be a sixth	But if you added  one it would still be one sixth	sd	5
And be ready	What do we do just diagram them	sd	1

Yeah I ll just we just have to diagram one of  em	No I ll diagram both	sd	1
No I ll diagram both	Yeah same here	sd	1
Yeah same here	I diagrammed both on the one third bigger  than one half by how much you know	sd	1
I diagrammed both on the one third bigger  than one half by how much you know	I did both on that  one	sd	1
I did both on that  one	I did those over the weekend	sd	1
I did those over the weekend	I m going to trace them just to get the exact size	sd	1
I m going to trace them just to get the exact size	You re  writing	sd	1
You re  writing	Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we  have the three thirds and we then the half	sd	4
And what we supposed to figure out after we did that	Which is bigger a half or two thirds	sd	1
Is it still the same or does it change  when your model changes	Two thirds is still bigger	sd	4
How many do you think	Eighteen	sd	4
So how much larger	It s bigger	sd	4
It s bigger	One eighteenth	sd	4
My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over  there	It was bigger by one one sixth	sd	4
This  is different from the other one or the same	It s different in a way and it s the same in a way	sd	4
How s it different and how s it the same	Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s  different because um this one it only ta the little box are  only um two three four there s only six of them and here s  there s eighteen and this the thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths	sd	5
You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths	and the two thirds over here is bigger by one sixth	sd	4
Ok Danielle what do you think about this time	Well um two thirds	sd	4
Can you build a two thirds and a one half  for him separate so we can then compare	Here s the two thirds and here s the half	sd	4
What s the difference	and it s bigger by two twelfths	sd	4
and it s bigger by two twelfths	It s um it s bigger by two twelfths	sd	4
How are the answers I don t understand  what do you think about this	One two three	sd	1
Over here it was how much	This one was bigger by three eighteenths	sd	4
And this one	Was bigger by  how much	sd	3
Was bigger by  how much	Two twelfths	ba	4
Two twelfths	One two three four five six seven eight nine  ten eleven twelve	sd	1
And your original one was	It was bigger by one sixth	sd	4
Oh so what do you think	I think they re all different but then all the same	sd	5
I think they re all different but then all the same	Cause  they re the same because the thirds are always bigger than  the half	sd	5
The two thirds are always bigger than the half	And um and they re different because these are all the  whites	sd	5
And um and they re different because these are all the  whites	they re different sizes	sd	4
they re different sizes	They re all different like one two uh three they re  different	sd	2
They re all different like one two uh three they re  different	So they re different like that	sd	4
Or this difference here	You could use a light green	sd	4
What would that be	That would be one That would  be one sixth	sd	4
And what did you say it was over here with the little  one	Um that s one sixth	sd	4
So if you used the light green	It could be one sixth	sd	4
And if you used the whites	It would be three eighteenths	sd	4
What about for this one	What problem	sd	1
Uh Gregory I want you to watch and see if  you agree with what Danielle is doing here	And  then that would be one sixth too	sd	4
Mmm over each of  em	That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that  one would be one sixth	sd	4
But you have had two two different names for the answer if  you did it this way it was	It was two twelfths	sd	4
And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had  the three what was the name for that one	Three eighteenths	sd	4
Alright so tell me which is bigger	Two thirds	sd	4
Again	Two thirds	sd	4
How many of you are  convinced you know how much bigger and no one can  persuade you otherwise that two thirds is not only bigger than  a half but it is how much bigger	One sixth	sd	4
How  many of you made a second model	Oh Oh	ba	1
What did you call one in that model	Ah the orange and red	sd	4
Did you get to have two thirds  bigger than a half	No	b	1
You didn t Michael	No they cant do that	sd	5
No they cant do that	Because um the  the two thirds are bigger than the half by a red	sd	5
Because um the  the two thirds are bigger than the half by a red	So they cant  use those whites to show it	sd	5
Oh but youre saying that youre saying that two thirds  whats a third	A third is the purple	sd	4
Just tell us	Um two thirds is two purples	sd	4
And what did you get to be  one half	Uh dark green	sd	4
And you got two thirds to  be bigger than one half	Yes	b	1
Yes	By one sixth	sd	4
By one sixth	Or or two twelfths	sd	2
Or or two twelfths	No	b	2
What color rod	Red	sd	4
And what did you get Meredith	Two twelfths	ba	4
What do you think about that	Well in a way	sd	1
Well in a way	No	b	1
No	Uh uh	sd	1
Well she showed its bigger by the two whites she shows  two whites bigger	Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together  one sixth	sd	4
Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together  one sixth	Yeah exactly	b	2
Yeah exactly	Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	sd	2
Shes calling one white one sixth	No Im not Im calling it one twelfth	sd	2
Shes calling one white one twelfth	Yeah but see just the whites together	sd	5
Yeah but see just the whites together	Thatd be right it  would be two twelfths	sd	5
Thatd be right it  would be two twelfths	But you have to combine them	sd	5
Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two  whites together again Meredith	One twelfth two twelfths	sd	4
And two white rods would be	Two twelfths	ba	4
And one red would be	One sixth	sd	4
So so what is Meredith saying here	Theres two answers	sd	4
Are there two answers	No theyre the same answer	sd	2
No theyre the same answer	No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red  and divided it into half she divided it into halves into half  and called and called each half one twelfth	sd	5
No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red  and divided it into half she divided it into halves into half  and called and called each half one twelfth	Theyre the exact  same answer except theyre just in two parts	sd	5
Well give it the number  name what did you say	One sixth	sd	4
And two whites can I write two  w    for two whites	Yeah	b	1
And youre calling two whites	Two twelfths	ba	4
But what Erik just told me  right is something about red and white	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	A red one red equals one red rod up here one red  equals two of the white ones	sd	4
Do you all agree to that	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yes	b	2
Yes	And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other  white rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	sd	5
And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other  white rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	But  when she calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are  actually just two white rods put together to equal a red so it  should be really its really one sixth	sd	5
But  when she calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are  actually just two white rods put together to equal a red so it  should be really its really one sixth	Because two whites  two whites	sd	5
She says one white is a twelfth and then if you put it  together with another one twelfth  shes saying you  get two twelfths	And its one sixth its one sixth	sd	4
Is that what you are saying	Yeah	b	1
All those things are they true	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	But I dont really think you could call call them two  twelfths because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size  as one sixth	sd	5
But I dont really think you could call call them two  twelfths because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size  as one sixth	Well if you want to you could call them I  guess	sd	5
Well if you want to you could call them I  guess	But I think it would be easier just to call them one  sixth then wouldnt want to exactly call them one twelfth and  another twelfth	sd	5
But I think it would be easier just to call them one  sixth then wouldnt want to exactly call them one twelfth and  another twelfth	Id just call them one sixth	sd	5
Id just call them one sixth	Therefore I think  you just really call them one sixth	sd	5
Therefore I think  you just really call them one sixth	Well maybe you can call them	sd	1
Well maybe you can call them	Well you can call them if you want to but	sd	4
Well we have different number names for these rods	they re not different	sd	4
they re not different	Theres just half of one theres just half of one	sd	4
So youre saying that one half of the one sixth is another way  of saying one twelfth	Theyre just two answers	sd	4
Isnt that what you said	What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would  be the exact same thing	sd	5
So are all of these  true statements	Yeah	b	1
So Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with  you when I say that its a red bigger in this model  right	Um hmm	sd	1
Is that a good  question Meredith	Mm hmm	sd	1
I can t wait to read what you  write to me	Two thirds	sd	4
Two thirds	Two thirds	sd	4
Two thirds	One sixth	sd	4
One sixth	Oh Oh	ba	1
Oh Oh	Ah the orange and red	sd	4
Ah the orange and red	No	b	1
No	No they cant do that	sd	2
No they cant do that	Because um the the two  thirds are bigger than the half by a red	sd	5
Because um the the two  thirds are bigger than the half by a red	So they cant use those whites  to show it	sd	5
So they cant use those whites  to show it	A third is the purple	sd	4
A third is the purple	Um two thirds is two purples	sd	4
Um two thirds is two purples	Uh dark green	sd	4
Uh dark green	Yes	b	1
Yes	By one sixth	sd	4
By one sixth	Or or two twelfths	sd	2
Or or two twelfths	No	b	2
No	Red	sd	4
Red	Two twelfths	ba	4
Two twelfths	Well in a way	sd	2
Well in a way	No	b	2
No	Uh uh	sd	2
Uh uh	Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together one  sixth	sd	2
Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together one  sixth	Yeah exactly	b	2
Yeah exactly	Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	sd	2
Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	No Im not Im calling it one twelfth	sd	4
No Im not Im calling it one twelfth	Yeah but see just the whites together	sd	1
Yeah but see just the whites together	Thatd be right it would be  two twelfths	sd	4
Thatd be right it would be  two twelfths	But you have to combine them	sd	4
But you have to combine them	You cant call them  you can call them separately but you could also call them combined  and if you combine them it would be uh one sixth	sd	5
You cant call them  you can call them separately but you could also call them combined  and if you combine them it would be uh one sixth	One twelfth two twelfths	sd	4
One twelfth two twelfths	Two twelfths	ba	4
Two twelfths	One sixth	sd	4
One sixth	Theres two answers	sd	4
Theres two answers	No theyre the same answer	sd	2
No theyre the same answer	No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red and  divided it into half she divided it into halves into half and called  and called each half one twelfth	sd	5
No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red and  divided it into half she divided it into halves into half and called  and called each half one twelfth	Theyre the exact same answer  except theyre just in two parts	sd	4
Theyre the exact same answer  except theyre just in two parts	One sixth	sd	4
One sixth	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Two twelfths	ba	4
Two twelfths	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	A red one red equals one red rod up here one red equals two  of the white ones	sd	5
A red one red equals one red rod up here one red equals two  of the white ones	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yes	b	2
Yes	And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other white  rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	sd	5
And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other white  rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	But when she  calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are actually just two white  rods put together to equal a red so it should be really its really one  sixth	sd	5
But when she  calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are actually just two white  rods put together to equal a red so it should be really its really one  sixth	Because two whites two whites	sd	5
Because two whites two whites	And its one sixth its one sixth	sd	2
And its one sixth its one sixth	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	But I dont really think you could call call them two twelfths  because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size as one sixth	sd	5
But I dont really think you could call call them two twelfths  because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size as one sixth	Well if you want to you could call them I guess	sd	1
Well if you want to you could call them I guess	But I think it  would be easier just to call them one sixth then wouldnt want to  exactly call them one twelfth and another twelfth	sd	5
But I think it  would be easier just to call them one sixth then wouldnt want to  exactly call them one twelfth and another twelfth	Id just call them  one sixth	sd	5
Id just call them  one sixth	Therefore I think you just really call them one sixth	sd	5
Therefore I think you just really call them one sixth	Well maybe you can call them	sd	1
Well maybe you can call them	Well you can call them if you want to but	sd	1
Well you can call them if you want to but	they re not different	sd	1
they re not different	Theres just half of one theres just half of one	sd	4
Theres just half of one theres just half of one	Theyre just two answers	sd	1
Theyre just two answers	What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would be the  exact same thing	sd	5
What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would be the  exact same thing	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Um hmm	sd	1

Lucka Maresova	Two and we multiply it by	sd	4
This number stays the same and the exponent will be	We multiply three times five	sd	4
Calculate 30 to the third power and describe to us how youre going to figure it out	First I multiply three to the third power	sd	4
Youll raise the powers	Raise the powers of three cubed	sd	4
Which totals	Seven is 27	sd	4
Dont write three cube that would confuse all of us	Seven equals to 27	sd	4
Its actually	Twentyseven and three three to the tenth power is 1000 so that is 27000	sd	5
Call up the next person and read them a problem	Alena	b	1
No one is absent today	Martusova is absent	sd	1
Martusova is absent	Negative three to the fourth power youre supposed to compare it	sd	4
Negative three to the fourth power youre supposed to compare it	Okay	b	1
Okay	And negative five to the third power	sd	4
Leave a blank between the two	Okay	b	1
Lucka was absent in the first class as well correct	What is the exponent	sd	3
What is the exponent	To the third power	sd	2
To the third power	So it will be negative three to the fourth power is larger because we have an even number negative coefficiency	sd	2
Yes the exponent is an even number but in the other one the exponent is an odd number so what kind of number will you come up with	Negative	sd	4
Negative but in this one the number will be	Positive	sd	4
So do you have it correct or not	I have it correct	sd	1
I have it correct	Incorrect you need to reverse the numbers	sd	2
Good next person lets hurry up	Write the main number two 128	sd	1
Michael Onderzak	To the seventh power	sd	4
Were not done yet	Seven squared times seven cubed	sd	5

Were dealing with power of quotient with the same	Same main number	sd	4
Next person	Eight to the X power divide it by eight to the third power equals eight to the eighth power	sd	5
So write next to it X equals	X equals	b	1
Correct	X equals eight	sd	4
Our only concern is this X	X equals	b	4
We cant be mixing it up okay	X equals 11	sd	4
How did she come up with that answer that X equals 11	I added up number three and number eight	sd	4
Instead of X write in number 11	Eight to the eleventh power divided by eight to the third power equals to eight to the eighth power	sd	5

Mm hm	that we added in and this two is the three	sd	5
that we added in and this two is the three	The  two in that one there is a three and theres two  ones on the outside	sd	5
Mm hum	So you get one three three one	sd	5
So you get one three three one	And then one the one and the three for the four	sd	5
And then one the one and the three for the four	Three and  the three for the six	sd	5
Three and  the three for the six	The three and the one for  the other four and then the other one on the end  and then continuing through the four and the  one together is the five	sd	5

Why where this ten comes  from when you know youre just saying well  theres a pattern here because you found them  but is there a way where you havent found  them that makes sense to predict the number of  paths of one you havent found	Well like to here I mean we would say	sd	1
You understand my question	Well like to here we would say it was thirty five	sd	4
How would you how where would  the thirtyfive come from	You cant justify it because You can justify  these because you can say you counted	sd	5
You cant justify it because You can justify  these because you can say you counted	You  cant justify that because you cant say you  counted	sv	5
You  cant justify that because you cant say you  counted	Yeah because we didnt count it	sd	5
Yeah because we didnt count it	Were saying  were following the pattern	sd	2
Right	Thats that is our justification as of now	sd	4
Right	That were just following the pattern	sd	4
What Im asking	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	What if three what if Pascal	sd	3
Because so you notice this pattern and the  pattern fits Pascals triangle	So does that mean theres thirtyfive for the  red one	sd	4
So does that mean theres thirtyfive for the  red one	Only these are zeros	sd	5
Only these are zeros	This is like one topping you know on the pizza	sd	5
This is like one topping you know on the pizza	Yeah one topping two toppings	aa	2

Remember how Mike you had thirtyfour for  the red one right	Um Yeah I think that was the problem	sd	2
Um Yeah I think that was the problem	Its thirtyfive	sd	2
Its thirtyfive	Yeah its thirtyfive	aa	2
Yeah its thirtyfive	Oh I probably missed one	sd	4
Oh I probably missed one	Good uh deduction	sd	1
So you counted thirtyfour by brute force and  youre saying that by this pattern um you  would feel more comfortable with the pattern  in saying thirtyfive	Yeah	b	1
Right	Did you actually get thirtyfive	sd	3
Did you actually get thirtyfive	I got thirtyfour	sd	4
I got thirtyfour	He got thirtyfour but you know hes been off  by like one cause you know	sd	2

The purples wouldn t fit  the greens wouldnt fit the whites would fit but maybe not the  reds	No if we trade it for a no lets trade it for a blue	sd	4
Oh I see youre calling I see youre calling one of those that top  train with the oranges and the blues and the blacks	Because then if you put another green here	sd	4
Because then if you put another green here	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	But    Erika and David What about the purple	sd	3
But    Erika and David What about the purple	Just take the purples out you dont need the purple	sd	2
Just take the purples out you dont need the purple	Well then thats going to mess everything up Meredith	sd	2
Well then thats going to mess everything up Meredith	Then what will be the twelfths	sd	3
Then what will be the twelfths	No yeah then what would be the  twelfths	sd	3
No yeah then what would be the  twelfths	We dont need the twelfths	sd	4
We dont need the twelfths	Yeah we do	sd	2
Yeah we do	Because thats the whole thing	sd	5
Because thats the whole thing	Thats the whole question	sd	2
Thats the whole question	Thats the whole answer	sd	4
Thats the whole answer	Its either three  twenty	sd	4
Its either three  twenty	Well wheres the two thirds	sd	4
Well wheres the two thirds	Well we dont really know	sd	1
Well we dont really know	But the question is which is bigger two thirds or three  fourths	sd	1
But the question is which is bigger two thirds or three  fourths	Well Erik um remember fourths if green was one twelfth then  that would be it but like I said before that I thought that well we  dont really need the greens	sd	5
Well Erik um remember fourths if green was one twelfth then  that would be it but like I said before that I thought that well we  dont really need the greens	Wait wait wait wait wait	sd	1
Wait wait wait wait wait	This isnt the model we did before	sd	5
This isnt the model we did before	The  model we did before I believe was three oranges and like  something else	sd	5
The  model we did before I believe was three oranges and like  something else	No it wasnt cause I remember your original model was an orange  a blue and a black and then I thought if we doubled it	sd	5
No it wasnt cause I remember your original model was an orange  a blue and a black and then I thought if we doubled it	What if we did just an two oranges two blues one black and one  blue	sd	5
What if we did just an two oranges two blues one black and one  blue	That ones not totally messing it up	sd	5
That ones not totally messing it up	Except the purples	sd	2
Except the purples	Purple we could figure out	sd	2
Purple we could figure out	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Ive an idea	sd	1
Ive an idea	Take away this put on this	sd	4
Take away this put on this	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	And then put a one there	sd	4
And then put a one there	Then you could put one here it would fit  better	sd	4
Then you could put one here it would fit  better	Then put a red	sd	2
Then put a red	Do you really need the green	sd	2
Do you really need the green	No not really	sd	4
No not really	So should we just take it out	sd	1
So should we just take it out	Yeah cuz I mean its giving us too big of a problem and we dont  need it	sd	5
Yeah cuz I mean its giving us too big of a problem and we dont  need it	I dont know why we put it on	sd	1
I dont know why we put it on	I just did that because I thought the green ones were the twelfths	sd	5
I just did that because I thought the green ones were the twelfths	This is a oh lets measure it	sd	4
This is a oh lets measure it	It is approximately  fiftythree	sd	4
It is approximately  fiftythree	No its fiftytwo	sd	4
No its fiftytwo	No its fiftytwo and a half	sd	4

It needs to be equal	Erik it starts like that	sd	2
Erik it starts like that	No it doesnt start at one it starts at zero	sd	2
No it doesnt start at one it starts at zero	Yes	sd	1
Yes	Another one another one another one another one	sd	4
Another one another one another one another one	Beth  This is a ten and ten of these equal to one	sd	4
Beth  This is a ten and ten of these equal to one	This is only one because if you call the orange a  ten and the ones equal to a ten when you call  this  a one then theyre going to  change to a one	sd	5
This is only one because if you call the orange a  ten and the ones equal to a ten when you call  this  a one then theyre going to  change to a one	Well I think I agree with Meredith	sv	2
Well I think I agree with Meredith	Because if  this is ten then this would be one then because  if you add ten of these up  then umm there  would be ten of these	sd	5
Because if  this is ten then this would be one then because  if you add ten of these up  then umm there  would be ten of these	So its ten	sd	5
So its ten	Well umm ten wholes because well these are  originally tenths and this is considered if this  is considered ten then this would be this  would be like switched around ten wholes	sd	5
Well umm ten wholes because well these are  originally tenths and this is considered if this  is considered ten then this would be this  would be like switched around ten wholes	So its like switched around	sd	4
So its like switched around	Ten wholes	sd	4
Ten wholes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Well if this was one then that would be  ten but when its switched around this is  all  all ten all ten tenths when you put them on  here theyre like they would be like ten wholes  even though this would be considered   Well   if this is supposed to be ten you put  then of these up then these would be ten  wholes	sd	4
Well if this was one then that would be  ten but when its switched around this is  all  all ten all ten tenths when you put them on  here theyre like they would be like ten wholes  even though this would be considered   Well   if this is supposed to be ten you put  then of these up then these would be ten  wholes	One whole	sd	4
One whole	One whole  no   I dont  know how to say it but I think I know it	sd	4
One whole  no   I dont  know how to say it but I think I know it	I dont  know how to say it	sd	1
I dont  know how to say it	Yeah yeah one	b	4
Yeah yeah one	Ok but but didnt you call this  a   ten	sd	4
Ok but but didnt you call this  a   ten	Oh then this would be  one  I guess	sd	4
Oh then this would be  one  I guess	Umm we got since umm if you have like if  you put all these  up to this   umm you would get umm ten I think	sd	5
Umm we got since umm if you have like if  you put all these  up to this   umm you would get umm ten I think	Wait   Ten	sd	5
Wait   Ten	And and this one  just  that would be one	sd	5
And and this one  just  that would be one	Yeah because if you have ten then  that  would be one of them	sd	5
Yeah because if you have ten then  that  would be one of them	If ten of these  equals one of these   then one of these  could be  one whole because and then ten of these  would ten wholes	sd	5
If ten of these  equals one of these   then one of these  could be  one whole because and then ten of these  would ten wholes	Okay	b	1
Okay	That would be  two	sd	4
That would be  two	And then three and four    and five and six	sd	1
And then three and four    and five and six	Call on my girlfriend here	sd	1
Call on my girlfriend here	The white would be one	sd	4
The white would be one	Well because it takes ten ones to make up an orange	sd	5
Well because it takes ten ones to make up an orange	It takes ten ones to make up an orange	sd	4
See what you think of this one	Its adding by all odd numbers	sd	5
Tell me what you mean by its add by odd numbers	Zero plus one is one plus three is four	sd	5
Zero plus one is one plus three is four	This plus five is seven Yeah  and then three plus seven is ten	sd	5
If I give you four for X	Thirteen	sd	4
Hmm hmm	Then I know for five it would be eleven and then six would be thirteen  so it would be nineteen	sd	5
What if I gave you my favorite number twentyfive again for X	Oh twentyfive	sd	1
Hmm hmm	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	See you be giving me hard  stuff	sd	1
Im trying to challenge you	I dont want to	sd	1
OK so what you think we can do	Oh fiftyfive	sd	4
Can you explain me this	I already figured this one out	sd	1
But can you first explain me this what you got and then you can tell me  that one	Oh I found that I was  like I came up with the first rule we got was times two plus five zero  times two plus five is five one times two plus five is seven and so on  and so on and then we came up with	sd	5
How you got this	One plus six	sd	1
One plus six	Oh that is for this rule	sv	1
Oh that is for this rule	The other rule that I came up with that James  came up with was that you add for every like number you add on one to  add to the number	sd	5
The other rule that I came up with that James  came up with was that you add for every like number you add on one to  add to the number	So for zero youre adding five that equals five	sd	5
So for zero youre adding five that equals five	For      one you add on one and it equals six so one plus six is seven	sd	5
Hmm hmm	Then for the two it would be plus seven is nine	sd	5
Hmm hmm	Three plus eight is eleven four plus nine is thirteen and five plus ten is  fifteen	sd	5
Three plus eight is eleven four plus nine is thirteen and five plus ten is  fifteen	And the pattern I also see is that it keeps on adding two we have  five plus two is seven seven plus two is nine plus two is eleven plus  two is thirteen plus two is fifteen	sd	5
OK then what is this here	And here it continues six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and  here it will continue fifteen plus two seventeen plus two is nineteen  plus two is twentyone plus two is twentythree plus two is twentyfive  plus two is twentyseven plus two is twentynine	sd	5
And how you figure out this rule	This one	sd	1
This one	Its easy	sd	1
Its easy	This is times   Oh  man I forgot	sd	1
This is times   Oh  man I forgot	Oh yeah times three plus one	sd	4
Oh yeah times three plus one	Times three plus one	sd	4
Times three plus one	Done	b	1
Done	Because 0 times 3 plus 1 equals 1	sd	5
Because 0 times 3 plus 1 equals 1	And 1  times 3 is 3 plus 1 is 4	sd	5
And 1  times 3 is 3 plus 1 is 4	2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7	sd	5
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7	And 3 times 3 is 9 plus  1 is 10	sd	5
What will you get for four	Huh	b	1
What you will get for four	Four	sd	1
Four	Thats easy	ba	1
Thats easy	I got to add the odd number	sd	5
I got to add the odd number	Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	sd	5
Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	Its just adding three	sd	2
Its just adding three	You find the answer easily	sd	1
You find the answer easily	1 plus 3 is  4	sd	5
1 plus 3 is  4	4 plus 3 is 7	sd	5
4 plus 3 is 7	7 plus 3 is 10	sd	5
7 plus 3 is 10	You just keep on adding three and you get  all of your answers	sd	5
David what do you think	Well I think that if you one half would be right in  the middle that would be the biggest	sd	5
Well I think that if you one half would be right in  the middle that would be the biggest	Then one third  that would be kind of smaller because you have fit  three pieces in there	sd	5
Then one third  that would be kind of smaller because you have fit  three pieces in there	Then one fourth would be  even smaller than one third	sd	5
Call something one and  zero draw it	Maybe the orange	sd	1
Just sketch it	If this is the one here	sd	5
If this is the one here	then one half would be there	sd	5
Can you mark one half right where you put it like  put it underneath so we can see it	What do you mean	qy	3
Just draw the number one half where you want to  show one half	Then one third	sd	5
Then one third	And then like one fourth	sd	5
Where do you think one fifth would be Meredith	The whole would be divided into fifths	sd	4
So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter  or to the left of a quarter	Left	sd	4
What do you think the next question Im going to  ask you	Where would you put one third	sd	4
Someone disagrees	I do	sd	2
I do	The one third approximately needs to be a  little more over because the one fourth has to  be  half of the one half	sd	5
The one third approximately needs to be a  little more over because the one fourth has to  be  half of the one half	So if you put one fourth half of  that it would be on the left  of the one third	sd	5
So if you put one fourth half of  that it would be on the left  of the one third	I know	aa	1
I know	I didnt I didnt put the one third	sd	4
I didnt I didnt put the one third	The one  third if it was one fourth it would probably be about  here right or just about an inch over	sd	4
The one  third if it was one fourth it would probably be about  here right or just about an inch over	So its not its  just approximate cause I dont think	sd	4
You want to call on Andrew to put in the one  quarter	rew Should I call on someone to place one fifth	sd	1
What do you think	I disagree	sd	2
For  those of you that disagree	Well if one fifth is next to the end	sd	5
Well if one fifth is next to the end	Then five plus  five equals up to ten so it would be like in the half	sd	5
Jakki thinks one tenth should go in the middle	no	b	2
James	I think it should go more towards zero	sd	4
I think it should go more towards zero	yeah	b	2
Alan	I think that the one tenth should be moved over just  a tiny bit	sd	4
Its getting hard to do this isnt it	Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into  tenths and you have a half mark	sd	5
Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into  tenths and you have a half mark	So you have to use  this as a guideline youd have five tenths on one  side and five tenths on the other side	sd	5
So you have to use  this as a guideline youd have five tenths on one  side and five tenths on the other side	Now up there if you took that little space between the zero  and the one fifth and you cut that five times it  wouldnt reach the half way mark	sd	5
Now up there if you took that little space between the zero  and the one fifth and you cut that five times it  wouldnt reach the half way mark	Its like one two three four this is all	sd	4
Brian	I agree with Mark	sd	2
I agree with Mark	It is a little far back	sd	4
It is a little far back	I think the  third should be moved up then the fourth should be  moved up	sd	4
I think the  third should be moved up then the fourth should be  moved up	I thought the fifth was wrong when I did  it because everything was kinda moved back	sd	5
Id like you to  place all the fractions one half one third one  fourth one fifth one sixth one seventh one eighth  one ninth and one tenth with your partner	So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	sd	5
So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	sd	5
And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red	sd	5
Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length	Im working on that one down here	sd	1
Youre working on that one it looks like youre working on a  bigger model here	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Does that one work	Yup	aa	1
Tell me about that one	Ok the two oranges make the whole	sd	4
Ok	And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	sd	5
And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	And  again if you remove that  it would take  one of those  to fill in the gap so its bigger by one half is  bigger than two fifths by one tenth	sd	5
You seemed to come up with that pretty  quickly	Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	sd	5
Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	So one of those  filled in  the gap	sd	5
So one of those  filled in  the gap	Probably if you used another one  another two you could fill in that with more  purples and using more reds too	sd	5
Interesting	And it could make more	sd	4
Thats an interesting theory could you kind of test that  one out for me and see see if you could build a bigger model	Im trying to build a bigger model	sd	1
If you need more stuff Ive got more rods	I can use from these models	sd	4
Ive also got more rods up there	Since 2 yellows off the top theres 2 yellows on the bottom	sd	5
I just want them to notice	Theres 4 and 4	sd	4
What you notice	Theres 4 yellows and then 4 greens	sd	5
Theres 4 yellows and then 4 greens	4 plus 4 equals eight	sd	5
If you think theyre different I want you to think of a reason why theyre different because these are separate pictures	Theres a square on the top and theres a line that goes down on the bottom and theres a line that goes through the right on the bottom	sd	5
Would that make them the same or different	Different	sd	4
Different	Do a yellow on the bottom	sd	4
Do a yellow on the bottom	Then 2 green ones at the top	sd	4
So would that make them different or the same	Different	sd	4
Different	Both of them have 6 white spaces	sd	4
Tamaz is going to say it one more time so that I can then point at it so we can all see it	Both of them have 6 white spaces	sd	4
Were going to count	123456	b	1
Lets do the one on top	123456	b	1
Kamora	There was 2 yellows on the bottom and 2 greens on the top and 2 on the top and 2 greens on the bottom	sd	4
What do you think	There would be more towers	sd	4
How many do you think there would be	Nineteen	b	4
What do you think Brian	Because there are fewer numbers of blocks	sd	5
So you think there would be more than sixteen or fewer than  sixteen	More	aa	4
What do you think	I think it would be less towers	sd	4
I think it would be less towers	Well because if you have sixteen now you wont get and you would need more because	sd	5
Or do you think there would be  more	Uhm  Exactly the same	sd	4
What do you think	I think higher	sv	4
You think there would be more than sixteen	Because if you get and you start making with  that one and that one you keep on and you could  make more than sixteen	sd	5
But because there are more blocks you think  there might be more towers	I think there might be less	sd	4
I think there might be less	Because three is less than four	sd	5
Because three is less than four	You would have the same  kind of patterns so there might be less than sixteen	sd	5
You think there would be fewer patterns if you had only  three	But at the same kind of patterns but fewer numbers	sd	4
Why do you think the same kind of patterns	Because same kind of patterns we have there at four but	sd	5
What do you mean by the same kind of patterns	Because well there are four here	sd	5
Because well there are four here	Because these are all red  and if you take one away and its the same pattern and it  only has three blocks	sd	5
Stephanie and Dana what would be one  that is different from what Jamie has	Well this one	sd	4
What does it look like	Well lets see	sd	1
Well lets see	Its got red blue and red	sd	4
Can you come up with one that is different from these	Like that	sd	1
What about you	Blue blue and red	sd	4
You think itll be twenty one	I found more combinations	sd	1
So you have to make a really  good guess because you are doing it for two people	I think the same	sv	4
I think the same	Same as sixteen	sd	4
Same as sixteen	You have four and you  take the top off and you have three	sd	5
You have four and you  take the top off and you have three	If you try to make some  three you would get the same	sd	5
Okay Brian and Jeff	We think its the same	sd	4
Okay what do you think	Well we think its the same	sd	4
OK can somebody explain what it is we re doing	Guess my Rule	sd	4
Can you listen to Milin please	We re guessing um what s going to be the equation	sd	4
Now I m going to tell you on these papers here I tell you the truth set and I want you to tell me the equation	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Like that	sd	4
If you figured out the equation write it down	Can I just tell you	sd	1
It s kind of hard to say an equation	It s sort of I sort of found how you could make them add up	sd	1
It s sort of I sort of found how you could make them add up	Wait here s what I don t get though	sd	1
Come show me the equation	He wants me to show you	sd	1
He wants me to show you	Excuse me	sd	1
Excuse me	I m coming through with an answer	sd	1
What are you going to show me ultimately	I got an idea	sd	1
You ve got an idea	The times number that you put there you add it to the first number unless it s zero and then you get your answer	sd	4
That s certainly what you do	See there s one in between there then two then three then four	sd	4
What are we doing now	Making equations	sd	4
What s the secret that you have for this	The two numbers when you add them they give you the number on the left and when you multiply them they give you the number on the right	sd	5

There it is	There we go	sd	1
There we go	A whole model and only sized that	sd	4
Ok I see one model up there and there s another one maybe Amy  and uh James you could build your model when their finished	Hey there s another thing you can quarter	sd	4
Hey there s another thing you can quarter	Look	sd	1
Look	There s two ways	sd	4
There s two ways	You can quarter a train of orange rods	sd	4
Let s see if you can find one that I haven t  seen yet	I wonder if you can quarter this	sd	5
I wonder if you can quarter this	I got another  one	sd	5
I got another  one	All you have to do is keep going down by two	sd	5
All you have to do is keep going down by two	Brown you minus two take that rod and you can quarter that one	sd	5
Brown you minus two take that rod and you can quarter that one	Brown black then dark green	sd	5
Brown black then dark green	Dark green can t be quartered no it can t	sd	2
Dark green can t be quartered no it can t	Two dark greens	sd	2
Two dark greens	We got it	sd	1
We got it	We have an answer	sd	1
We have an answer	We have four different  models	sd	4
So you re going to explain how you got your different models  Alan	We re subtracting by two	sd	5
We re subtracting by two	Two down from the orange would be the  brown	sd	5
I  want you to hear this	four already	sd	4
four already	So two from the brown  would be yellow	sd	4
So two from the brown  would be yellow	Two from the brown would be two yellows	sd	2
Two from the brown would be two yellows	Yellows reds	sd	2
Yellows reds	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	No	b	2
No	You can t quarter the yellow	sd	4
You can t quarter the yellow	That s just the point you can t	sd	4
That s just the point you can t	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Oh yeah you re right	b	2
Oh yeah you re right	Purple	sd	4
Purple	Purple purple	sd	2
Purple purple	That s it that s it	ba	1
That s it that s it	Purple s reds then	sd	4
Purple s reds then	Yeah purple	aa	2
Yeah purple	Two reds for a purple	sd	4
Two reds for a purple	Definitely definitely	aa	1
Definitely definitely	Two minus purple would be red	sd	5
Two minus purple would be red	Red	sd	5
Red	Here s what we ll do	sd	1
Here s what we ll do	We ll put all our fractions in this box top so  they won t break	sd	1
We ll put all our fractions in this box top so  they won t break	We ll just put it on the table	sd	1
We ll just put it on the table	We re ready oh no we re not	sd	1
We re ready oh no we re not	Yes we are	sd	1
You went back to what	One twentyfour	sd	4
Then what did you do next	I did half of one twentyfour	sd	4
Then what did you do with that sixtytwo	Two right	b	4
Sixtytwo	I subtracted two and since I had already done   You subtracted two from what	sd	4
I subtracted two and since I had already done   You subtracted two from what	From sixty two	sd	4
Ah huh	Since I had already done how many rods sixty has I just went back here look here it is one hundred and ninety eight rods and I made one for two and it gave me eight rods and then I added eight rods to one hundred and ninety eight	sd	5
So you are saying you added eight to what	Eight rods to my other rods one hundred ninetyeight	sd	4
Let s think so you are saying going from sixty to sixty two you added eight rods right is that what you are saying	Yeah What	b	3
You said   basically you are trying to tell me that   you are trying to find for sixtytwo	Yes	b	1
You went down to sixty right	Yeah	b	1
You know how many are in sixty and you are adding two ladders right	Yeah	b	1
Is that what you are saying	A ladder with two steps so I counted	sd	4
We know two has eight right	Yeah	b	1
But six how many six has	Eight times three	sd	4
Can you put for six	Six steps	sd	1
Yeah	Oh my God	ba	1
Oh my God	Have mercy on me	sd	1
Have mercy on me	Oh messed up	sd	4
Oh messed up	There you are happy	sd	1
And how many do we have	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty	sd	1
A ladder of two how many do they have	Yeah	b	1
So you write eight you get what	Twentyeight	sd	4
So let s see whether eight has twentyeight	Wait a minute I have twentysix	sd	4
So then what we are going to do	Go to my rule minus two	sd	4
Go to my rule minus two	Twentysix	sd	4
I am finding hard to follow	I need to go home	sd	1
I need to go home	Here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twentyfour twentyfive	sd	1
Here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twentyfour twentyfive	Ooh Ooh I am right	b	1
Ooh Ooh I am right	I am right twentysix	sd	4
I am right twentysix	Tut tut toon	sd	1
Tut tut toon	I got to be out of here	sd	1
So is this right or wrong	It is right	aa	4
It is right	I did the same thing for this how I did this and it is right	sd	4
I did the same thing for this how I did this and it is right	I just did it right now	sd	1
I just did it right now	I m right	b	4
What does it have to do with the ladder	With the ladder	sd	1
With the ladder	Because James I don t know how he did it but I do it because James was right so I told you	sd	2
No you subtract two in your rule you always talk about subtracting two	Because before when I would just multiply by two and then I noticed that I was wrong	sd	5
Because before when I would just multiply by two and then I noticed that I was wrong	I was off by two so I just starting subtracting two or	sd	5
But you would do that for any number whether it is odd or even you do all that	No just   Wait yeah yeah yeah odd or even and then for een anh anh een aa	sd	4
But did we ever get the second number for this problem	Maybe there is no second number	sd	4
Well there might be	Might be	sd	1
Might be	Oh dur	b	1
Oh dur	Oh I m sorry it s not two	sd	4
Oh I m sorry it s not two	It can t be two	sd	2
It can t be two	I lost my eraser	sd	1
I lost my eraser	My eraser is gone	sd	1
My eraser is gone	It s like not here anymore	sd	1
It s like not here anymore	You have no respect	sd	1
You have no respect	Look	sd	1
Look	No another number for number two	sd	2
I guess we can go on	I know four	sd	4
See what happens when you put four in the box	But it s got to	sd	2
But it s got to	We did that one already	sd	1
We did that one already	No more	sd	1
No more	One answer is enough	sd	1
One answer is enough	I almost did number six	sd	1
I almost did number six	No it doesn t work	sd	2
No it doesn t work	I think I got eight	sd	1
I think I got eight	I think I got eight	sd	1
I think I got eight	You finished six	sd	1
You finished six	As soon as you people figure out another problem	sd	1
As soon as you people figure out another problem	Number five is five	sd	2
Number five is five	Six times two	sd	2
And somebody was telling me a number for this one	Three	sd	2
Three	Six is three	sd	2
Six is three	I got it	sd	1
If I put five in I ve got twentyfive	That s six	sd	4
That s six	Eight is six	sd	4
Minus thirty that much would be	Negative five plus five	sd	4
Negative five and then plus five would be zero	You got number six	sd	1
You got number six	Is it right	aa	1
Is it right	That s wrong	sd	4
That s wrong	Make sure	aa	1
Make sure	I m almost positive	sd	1
I m almost positive	We ve got one for number six	sd	1
For number six	We ve got one too	sd	1
Okay I m going to erase something here	The first one	sd	1
The first one	We got both of them	sd	1
We got both of them	Is it right	aa	1
Is it right	Did you guys try it	sd	1
Can I erase this stuff up here	I didn t try	sd	1
I didn t try	We have one for everyone	sd	1
We have one for everyone	You have one for everyone	sd	1
You have one for everyone	I have two for everyone	sd	1
Huh which one is it Stephanie	Number six	aa	1
It s box times box minus	Uh blank times blank	sd	4
Uh blank times blank	You don t understand	sd	2
You don t understand	Minus seven times blank equals plus twelve equals zero	sd	1
Wait box times box minus seven times box plus how much	Plus twelve	sd	1
Twelve equals zero and you got a number for that	Three	sd	4
How about three for that	What s number seven	sd	3
What s number seven	I ll do number seven	sd	1
Did anybody check that	Yeah it s right	aa	4
Yeah it s right	What s eight	sd	3
What s eight	Seven is eight	sd	4
You ve got another one for this problem here	Yeah number six	b	1
Okay and how about that would somebody	I got it	sd	1
I got it	It s four	sd	4
Check four for this and see if it works	I checked it out	sd	1
I checked it out	It s four boys	sd	4
Okay	It s four because I m so smart	sd	4
Hum anybody got anything for number six yet	Six three	sd	4
Six three	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	4
Three	Three and four	sd	2
Okay let s try that Can I maybe erase this one here	That means I have to go lower	sd	4
Number six is the one that you just did	What is number five	sd	1
What is number five	Number five we got five	sd	3
Number five we got five	Yeah right so it is number seven that we want	sd	2
Twelve eight	That is right	aa	4
That is right	It s three and two	sd	2
It s three and two	No seven is two	sd	2
Have you got numbers for this	Is that number seven	sd	1
Is that number seven	Yeah	b	1
Hum well okay	Can we do some more stuff with the glass pieces	sd	1
Can we do some more stuff with the glass pieces	I like how Stephanie she had such an important job	sd	1
We ve got some so we ve got some where there are two numbers and some where there is only one number	What	ba	1
What	Holding that bag	sv	1
Holding that bag	Maybe there is two and we just didn t get them	sd	4
You are right	I ll do seven	sd	1
I ll do seven	Maybe	sd	1
Maybe there are two and maybe we didn t get them	Maybe	sd	1
Maybe	But there is a chance that there isn t two	sd	4
But there is a chance that there isn t two	Yeah I know they already got that	sd	2
Yeah I know they already got that	Yeah	b	2
Has anybody settled any of these others yet	Just erase them all that s all	sd	1
Just erase them all that s all	I ve got them all	sd	1
I ve got them all	We got everyone	sd	1
We got everyone	We got every single one	sd	1
There might not be another number for those	So then why did you put two spaces	sd	3
So then why did you put two spaces	Maybe there is	sd	2
Maybe there is	Maybe there isn t	sd	2
Maybe there isn t	Why can t he tell us the correct answer	sd	1
Why can t he tell us the correct answer	Yeah until we figure it out	sd	1
Yeah until we figure it out	You just waste our time you are just wasting it	sd	1
You just waste our time you are just wasting it	We are just rotting until someone comes along and POW its all over	sd	1
So now we are down to number eight	I have eight	sd	1
I have eight	I have eight	sd	1
I have eight	We are done	sd	1
We are done	Maybe ten Ten times ten is twenty it s sixty	sd	5
We need a discussion on ethics	Brian four doesn t work	sd	4
Brian four doesn t work	Huh	b	1
Huh	Four doesn t work	sd	4
We need a discussion on ethics and morality for a second	For eight yes it does	sd	4
For eight yes it does	No it doesn t	sd	2
No it doesn t	I tried it already	sd	1
Suppose somebody discovered a really neat secret way of doing this should they tell or should they keep it a secret	I ll keep it a secret	sd	1
I ll keep it a secret	I d tell	sd	1
I d tell	Actually I would tell because then I would get the recognition for everyone would know I solved it because I am very smart	sd	1
Actually I would tell because then I would get the recognition for everyone would know I solved it because I am very smart	You d get your name in the history	sd	1
You d get your name in the history	Yeah we can t invent nothing	sd	1
Yeah we can t invent nothing	Jeff	aa	1
Jeff	Yeah he knows the secret	sd	1
Yeah he knows the secret	You know what Mike	sd	1
You know what Mike	I m gonna name my invention	sd	1
I m gonna name my invention	My invention is the self dreading	sd	1
Okay now uh did we get any numbers for number eight yet	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	aa	1
Yes	We have two holes	sd	4
We have two holes	Okay hum four	sd	2
It pays to have and you agree that it works	Yeah I did	b	1
And you agree that it works	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Sixteen hum minus fortyeight and that is negative fortyeight	sd	5
Did anybody get any more numbers for this	Okay guys let s get a move on	sd	1
Okay guys let s get a move on	Come on guys let s go	sd	1
Do you remember what we talked about	If they would tell them how much people can fit in like three  of these	sd	4
But there were just three what  was	It was like how many people can fit inside	sd	4
It was like how many people can fit inside	I know	aa	1
I know	The question was if you have  if there  would be more same or less	sd	4
Okay the question was if there is a tower instead of four  blocks there are three blocks in it  how many  towers are there	There would be sixteen	sd	4
Dana and Stephanie	We think its the same	sd	4
We think its the same	Well because you are just taking one away from here its  not like its going to change the whole thing	sd	5
Well because you are just taking one away from here its  not like its going to change the whole thing	Its gonna be  one less	sd	5
What do you think	Same	sd	4
So what about you	We think its more	sv	4
We think its more	We think its the same	sd	2
We think its the same	I know but I think its two hundred	sv	4
Oh so its a lot more	I think its the same	sv	4
What do you think	Less	sd	4
How many do you think youll have	7 Fourteen	sd	4
7 Fourteen	Oh fourteen	sd	2
What do you think	About twenty	sd	4
Hello whats your name	Michelle	sd	1
And your name is	Erin	sd	1
Michelle was working with other	when Erin was gone	sd	1
What do you think Michelle	More	aa	4
Michelle and Erin do you agree	Yeah	b	2
Tell me your name again	Mathew	sd	1
Mathew	We said not the same	sd	1
Did you change your mind from the same	Yeah	b	1
And then	And then count up how many you have	sd	4
Ok Jackie	Um well we thought it was six twelfths because	sd	4
Jackie I am sorry I cant hear its so loud here	Um we thought is was um six twelfths because there are um twelve  pieces in all and she got six and six makes half	sd	5
What do you think	I have another one	sd	1
Danielle	Um I thought um it would be um two fourths	sd	4
How did you think that	Because if she got a half then the top two rows um is a half and  then that s two fourths	sd	5
Danielle thinks  that another number name for how much of the candy bar we gave  Dr Martino is two fourths so we re interested in knowing how  Danielle was thinking about that	Well this row and this row is a half   and then these are two fourths	sd	4
Can you help the class understand that	Because there s four rows	sd	5
Brian	I just found out another way that a half can be	sd	1
Brian	If I agree	sd	2
If I agree	Ok	b	1
Ok	Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	sd	5
Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	Well  well I agree because there are four thirds on there but but when  there s a half there are only there s three fourths instead of four  thirds	sd	5
Where are your four thirds	Well well well when you said   to split it in half   like that there are only two fourths left over  yeah there are only two fourths when it s a whole there are four  thirds   I can t explain it too well	sd	4
Danielle do you want to go up there and	No I just have something to say	sd	1
No I just have something to say	Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	sd	5
Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	But I thought about it the other way around	sd	2
What do you mean by the other way around um Brian	Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	sd	5
Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	I have another way	sd	2
I have another way	It s I have three I think three sixths	sd	4
Three sixths	Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	sd	5
Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	sd	5
Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	There s one sixth another sixth another sixth another sixth another  sixth another sixth and if you split them in half there s three of  them on top	sd	5
So he is saying that  these two little pieces of candy and these two and these two and  these two and these two and these two I don t know if that is what  you said Brian but something like that	Yeah	b	1
Brian	We did two fourths	sd	4
Nice and loud	We did two fourths	sd	4
Two fourths Do we have another number name for half of the  candy bar	No I was going to say one half	sd	4
Are these all the ones we had	There are six twelfths	sd	4
We said six twelfths two fourths we  said one half Brian	Three sixths	sd	4
The two whites together	Two tenths	sd	4
Michael	One fifth	sd	4
And what other number name can I  call the red one	Two tenths	sd	4
So we re particularly looking for formulas like this where you don t need to know the number in the triangle all you need is to put the number in the box and that will tell you the number in the triangle	Is it wrong	sd	1
Is it wrong	Don t erase	sd	1
Don t erase	I ll whistle it into the microphone	sd	1
I ll whistle it into the microphone	Michael do you know a secret	sd	2
Michael do you know a secret	I ll keep it a secret till we are sure	sd	1
I ll keep it a secret till we are sure	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Michelle do you have a secret	sd	2
Michelle do you have a secret	We think we do	sd	1
We think we do	I do	sd	1
I do	We are almost there	sd	1
I m going to make up this problem here and that s going to be nineteen and that number is going to be sixty	I have Amy me and Brian have it	sd	1
I have Amy me and Brian have it	I know what the secret is but I don t know how to use it	sd	3
I know what the secret is but I don t know how to use it	I have it too	sd	1
This problem here and it s nineteen	It s the multiples of a number	sd	4
It s the multiples of a number	Uh oh	aa	1
Uh oh	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Is one of the numbers six	sd	4
Is one of the numbers six	I don t know the secret	sd	1
I don t know the secret	No don t erase that	sd	1
Anybody got any others	Would another one be ten	sd	4
Would another one be ten	I know	aa	1
I know	Oh	b	1
Oh	I think what does it say	sd	3
I think what does it say	Five and twelve	sd	2
Five and twelve	Thirty	ba	2
One of the numbers is thirty	It doesn t work	sd	2
It doesn t work	I know	aa	2

It only worked for a couple of them	It doesn t work	sd	2
What good is a secret that doesn t work	Ten doesn t work	sd	4
Ten doesn t work	I can say	sd	1
I can say	I can think it s twelve or I can think it s eighty three in my head but it s worthless it s worthless if if it s not right	sd	2
I can think it s twelve or I can think it s eighty three in my head but it s worthless it s worthless if if it s not right	Three doesn t work	sd	2

All of them don t work	None of them work	sd	2
None of them work	None of them work	sd	2
None of them work	Michael do thirty	sd	1
Michael do thirty	Thirty doesn t work either	sd	2
You checked all of them and none of them worked	Where is the calculator	sd	1
Where is the calculator	Is there an answer to that one	sd	1
Is there an answer to that one	I think I know why	sd	1
I think I know why	Should I tell you why	qy	1
Should I tell you why	Because of the geometric shapes	sd	5
Because of the geometric shapes	I know what it is	sd	1
I know what it is	Six doesn t work	sd	2

Where the heck is the problem	I don t know	sd	1
I don t know	There is no more problems	sd	1
There is no more problems	Six doesn t work	sd	2
Six doesn t work	What do you think it is	sv	3
What do you think it is	I know the answer to five	sd	2
I know the answer to five	It s either eight or thirteen	sd	2
It s either eight or thirteen	It s got to be sixteen	sd	2
It s got to be sixteen	It s eight or thirteen	sd	2
It s either eight or thirteen	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	It s got to be one of those two	sd	4
Would someone check eight and someone check thirteen	Someone check eight and thirteen	sd	1
Someone check eight and thirteen	Ankur look look	sd	1
Take some of these other ideas but write them have you done it	Yeah	b	1
Well at some point we will we need to talk about	You ve got to try and figure it out first though before we tell you	sd	1
Yeah I think it s a good idea to try and figure it out yourself	OK the number here the number that s here you see will always go here and always in this place will go the one and the answer goes here which is four the answer is seventeen	sd	5
Yeah that s certainly right OK um can you think of a way to write it so that we ll know that the number that goes here has to go here too	Like we did on the back	sd	1
No with symbols and boxes and triangles we	Can we do it like this	sd	1
Can we do it like this	The box here and the box here	sd	1
Yeah you want to go and do that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I just have to write one more thing	sd	1
You re talking about this one right here	OK well it s a zero times one and then it s like the plus one and then it goes from like the one times one cause it s just zero one two three four five	sd	5
OK well it s a zero times one and then it s like the plus one and then it goes from like the one times one cause it s just zero one two three four five	And then it goes one one two	sd	5
And then it goes one one two	You see there	sd	1
It could be zero	Yeah it could be zero	sd	1
Yeah it could be zero	Zero one two three four five	sd	1
Zero one two three four five	And then you just keep the plus one and you go	sd	4
See if you can	OK	b	1
OK	What do you mean by box and triangle notation	sd	3
You ve got it OK let s get it down	It s the wrong way he s got it backwards	sd	2
It s the wrong way he s got it backwards	When the box is here the number that goes here that goes in the next box would be legal	sd	5
When the box is here the number that goes here that goes in the next box would be legal	So these two have to be the same	sd	5
Yup do you agree	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And this is always one and the triangle is the answer	sd	4
That is great	Yes	b	1
Yes	Is that what you were thinking	sv	1
Yeah that s what I did but I didn t invent it somebody told me it	We invented it	sd	1
You reinvented it	But I looked in the answer booklet and it was wrong	sd	4
Was the answer booklet wrong or were you wrong	I was wrong	sd	4
I was wrong	Sir I dont understand any of this chapter	sd	3
Sir I dont understand any of this chapter	But you told me it was correct	sd	1
Thats nice	Yes	b	1
That gives me something to do	When is little Pete coming	sd	1
Hell be coming up shortly	I am at 28 but theres a few things I dont understand	sd	1
I think so	Sir	sd	1
Why not	Well shes at a funeral	sd	1
Hm	Sir what is this	sd	1
Sir what is this	For photo or video	sd	1
Its called video	Sir I forgot my folder	sd	1
Do you have any loose sheets of paper	Yes I have those in my backpack	sd	1
And your book	That I do have	sd	1
Do you still remember where you had difficulties	Uh no	b	1
But it doesnt make any difference otherwise just pretend its not here	Why is it here	sd	1
Okay	What is it for sir	sd	1
Uh to shoot a film	To shoot a film	sd	1
Youre still going to uh youre still going to uh do Pythagoras	What	ba	3
Are you still going to do Pythagoras or chapter five	Oh Ill do uh	sd	1
I would prefer that	Yes okay	aa	1
What did you say	Can I fetch my books for a second	sd	1
You guys have class	Yes	b	1
Where do you guys have class	Uh we dont know	sd	1
Uh we dont know	Your mother came	sd	1
Those cases from one A or one D whatever it is	Sir you really have to explain this	sd	3
Sir you really have to explain this	How are we supposed to do that	sd	3
How are we supposed to do that	I dont understand a thing	sd	3
I dont understand a thing	I am at three	sd	1
I am at three	I didnt understand it at all	sd	3
I didnt understand it at all	Ha	sd	1
Ha	Excuses	b	1
Excuses	Yes excuses	aa	1
Yes excuses	There are more of us who dont understand it	sd	1
There are more of us who dont understand it	This is it I think	sv	1
This is it I think	No I dont understand it	sd	3
Very well	I  understand it	sd	1
I  understand it	Really	b	1
Yes all right	add it up because I dont really understand it	sd	4
You	I didnt bring my notebook	sd	1
Can you get some paper	Can I get some paper	sd	1
Do you know where you were	Yes at 16	sd	1
Yes	Yes I dont understand assignment 15	sd	3
Assignment 15	I dont have my notebook with me either	sd	1
I dont have my notebook with me either	I have a piece of paper for you	sd	1
This is going great you guys	Yes	b	1
Will you make sure to put it in your notebook	Yes	b	1
I will come by several people and then I will uh for everybody	Hes copying it	sd	1
And yes right now you are calculating variables arent you	Thats right	aa	1
So for example with three E is three E plus seven E	Yes if you add that then the outcome is	sd	4
How many how many Es do you have	Ten E altogether	sd	4
Ten E altogether	That is ten E squared	sd	4
No why squared	Yes because you have two Es	sd	5
How much are three Es plus seven Es	Ten Es	sd	4
Only if youd multiply it then itll get an E squared	Oh	b	1
Two times three is	Two times three is six	sd	5
And E times E that is the E squared	Yes but still here	sd	1
Yes	No but if this here is you have to take the same ones	sd	5
No but if this here is you have to take the same ones	I multiplied all of them but I still ended up with the same thing	sd	5
I multiplied all of them but I still ended up with the same thing	Just 11 P	sd	5
Just 11 P	But you are not allowed to multiply those with each other as stated somewhere over here look	sd	5
But you are not allowed to multiply those with each other as stated somewhere over here look	Two different letters you cannot uh	sd	5
No that is correct	Yes	b	1
So in this equation you have to fill in P equals one	Yes	b	1
What is the solution to this	Eleven times one	sd	4
Eleven times one	Eleven	sd	4
And what is the solution to this	Also 11	sd	4
Is it possible that they could be the same	Yes	b	1
So I will fill in P equals six	Is 66	aa	4
And over here	Sixtysix	sd	4
Three times six is	Three times six is uh 18	sd	5
Three times six is uh 18	Six times eight is 48 oh no that is not correct	sd	5
Twentysix	Yes	b	1
Well that is something completely different	No	b	1
Because P equals 10	Well 110 and 80 plus 30 that one does work out fine	sd	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
What is three times 10	I have that one three times 10	sd	5
I have that one three times 10	Thirty	ba	5
And eight plus 30	Eight plus 30 is 38	sd	5
Eight plus 30 is 38	I need to multiply eight by 10 as well dont I	sd	5
I need to multiply eight by 10 as well dont I	Oh no	ba	4
Oh no	Now Im lost	sd	1
Whats eight times what is eight plus 30	Eight plus 30	sd	5
Eight plus 30	Thirtyeight	sd	5
And 11 times 10 is 110	Oh like that	sd	1
For P you just fill in 10 not 11 P times 10	Oh	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
You have to fill in something at this spot	Yes	b	1
That is what it is about	make over again	sd	1
Which one	Do I have to make some calculations or uh resolve this I mean	sd	1
Do I have to make some calculations or uh resolve this I mean	Or do I just have to	sd	1
How much are six As plus five As	Eleven As	sd	4
And two B plus three C can you add anything up here	No it just remains as it is	sd	4
Where are you at	I am now at H because it is uh how are you supposed to its not possible because there is no E written at the end	sd	5
Not over here but in the other one there is	There is I see	sd	1
There is I see	So this is six	sd	4
Uh huh	So what are you supposed to do with that	sv	3
So what are you supposed to do with that	Do you just have to	sd	3
How many Fs do you have here	Huh	b	3
How many Fs do you have here	Three	sd	4
And here	One uh three	sd	4
Three Fs plus three Fs is	Eleven Fs	sd	4
Eleven Fs	Oh no here it says minus	sd	4
Over here is I mean behind them here is an F here and there	Yes	b	1
Over here we have three and over here we have three as well so that is six minus five equals one F	So one F is clear	sd	4
So one F is clear	And then one F minus three	sd	4
F minus three	Okay	b	1
Can you move along	Yes	b	1
With that table	This one	sd	1
This one	If I am correct it should be correct	sd	1
Well yes if you are correct then it should be correct thats	Yes okay but	sd	1
But do you understand what you are doing	Yes	b	1
And you are not caught up so you better continue working	Yes	b	1
Or are you at uh five	But I dont understand	sd	3
Which one dont you understand	Problem D	sd	1
Problem D	Twelve Y minus Y is that 12 or is it	sd	3
How many Ys do you have	It is minus Y isnt it 11 Y	sd	4
The first section	Twelve	sd	4
Give me a break and keep working please	Twelve	sd	4
One Y	Yes or two	sd	4
No because it says minus Y here so that means minus one Y	Oh	b	1
So 12 minus one equals 11 so you have 11 Ys	How are you supposed to know that because Y could also be two	sd	3
That is something else because then you will fill in a number for Y	Yes	b	1
No	Twelve	sd	4
So how many will you have left	Eleven	sd	4
It is not exactly uh what number the Y is because its only afterwards that youll fill something in for Y	Yes but if you start filling in something for Y then it doesnt make sense any more	sd	5
Suppose for example you fill in three for Y	Thirtysix	sd	4
Minus	Three thats	sd	4
Do you understand it	Yes	b	1
Very well	Teacher	b	1
Are the diagrams coming along	This one	sd	1
Yes	Yes somewhat	sd	1
Yes somewhat	But we still had a question about eight	sd	3
But we still had a question about eight	One that we already asked you last week	sd	3
Uh huh	And were still clueless	sd	3
Which eight	This one	sd	1
Did you make a drawing of this	Yes	b	1
Can you show me	But I  because I copied this	sd	1
Thats no big deal	Yes it is	sd	1
Um what is the surface area of the top part	Fifty centimeters	sd	4
Here you have the 50 and there the 15	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	You have to do 50 times 15	sd	4
How long is this section	Um 750 centimeters	sd	4
What is the length of this here	Fifty centimeters	sd	4
What is the height of this	Fifteen	sd	4
Of this whole area	Oh yes	b	1
You do 50 times H length times width	Yes	b	1
Which is 50 times the H Yes	Yes	b	1
Fifty times 15 and 50 times H	So the surface area is 50 times H	sd	1
Plus 750	Okay	b	1
Are you able to sniff your way through it	Huh	b	3
Or are you doing okay	Oh oh yes it is not too bad	sd	1
Oh oh yes it is not too bad	Sir question 18 B	sd	1
Sir question 18 B	Yes I was just entertaining myself	sd	1
What is this all about	I had time to finish my homework and	sd	1
But what is it	To see if I have too much homework	sd	1
To see if I have too much homework	But that is not what you asked	sd	1
But that is not what you asked	Look this is question 18 E You have to take similar terms together	sv	1
Yes what did you get in uh the first part	Huh	b	3
Huh	Here	sd	4
Here	This one here	sd	4
This one here	First you have to calculate this	sd	4
Yes	Then this I already did that	sd	1
Then this I already did that	Seventy times 50 equals 3500	sd	5
Seventy times 50 equals 3500	Then 60 times 120 equals 7200	sd	5
Yes	And then divide	sd	4
And then here you have something written here	Yes	b	1
Uh	That is something like uh then you had to write this one no write it without brackets this one	sd	4
Right	And then this one is 3500 plus 120 and then say 20 times 60 and 120 time B say	sd	4
And then this one is 3500 plus 120 and then say 20 times 60 and 120 time B say	And one 120 times 60 is 7200	sd	5
And you have 120 times minus B	Yes	b	1
How much is 120 times minus B	Minus B Yes or uh	sd	4
One hundred twenty minus 120 B	Yes and do you have to write that down here as well	sd	1
Whereas here you write 120	Over here 20	sd	4
Over here 20	One hundred twenty	sd	4
No what is this 120 about	That relates to uh this 3500 plus 120	sd	4
Sixty times 120	Is 500 plus 7200 and then minus 120 B	sd	5
So the B has to be taken away over here	Plus or times	sd	3
Yes	Yes okay	aa	1
Fifteen didnt work	Huh	b	3
Huh	No it did work	sd	4
No it did work	I just didnt come around to it yet	sd	1
I just didnt come around to it yet	I still had a question about this	sd	3
I still had a question about this	Ill make it in a second	sd	1
Okay yes	Are you actually wearing a microphone	sd	1
Yes	Could you step over here oops I dont understand half of this	sd	3
Could you step over here oops I dont understand half of this	I understand A though	sd	1
I understand A though	Yes I dont know	sd	1
Take a moment to draw it	This	sd	1
Just uh the no youve got it already its already here the multiplication table	Yes but I had	sd	1
Or how much is three times two D	Six D	sd	4
Yes and you can fill in the second one as well	Sir at 20 you just have to add uh	sd	4
With	At 20 dont you simply have to do uh minus 50 minus 1540	sd	4
Yes	Kind of a dumb question really	sd	1
Is it coming along	I dont understand 15	sd	1
Can you write them down more briefly	Yes	b	1
Can you do that	Yes	b	1
Yes	I am tired	sd	1
That is possible	Why wouldnt it be possible	sd	3
Did you succeed with 15	Uh no	b	1
You also dont have a notebook with you	No	b	1
And then in a minute you will also did you succeed with 15	No we didnt do	sd	1
Did 15 work out	I didnt do that one	sd	1
Okay	I dont understand this at all	sd	3
I dont understand this at all	the circumference of	sd	4
One of these sides this one is H	Yes	b	1
So what is the surface area	Five squared	b	4
Right	Yes but isnt all of this part of it as well	sd	4
And you have four times five times the H Four sections of five multiplied by H	Yes	b	1
That is the surface area and the circumference is H plus H plus five plus H plus H plus five	So do I need to add them all up	sd	1
Yes	Yes but I dont understand the circumference uh the surface area do you have to this must be uh five squared	sd	3
Yes	And then afterwards you still have to write down five um times five five times H	sd	4
Plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H	Or can I do four times H as well	sd	4
Four multiplied by five times H	Oh right	b	1
And this is five H	Yes	b	1
And then you have these four pieces of five H	Twenty H	sd	5
Twenty H	Then it becomes four times H Four times five times H	sd	5
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	Twenty H	sd	4
Twenty H	Sir I dont understand it	sd	3
Sir I dont understand it	How are you supposed to do this then	sd	3
How are you supposed to do this then	For example Q is two B	sd	3
Plus three C can you do anything with that	Yes I think I dont know	sd	1
I cant do anything with it	No	sd	1
So can you do anything with it	No	b	1
Exactly	This will remain the same then	sd	4
This will remain the same then	Then at C What are you supposed to do here	sd	3
Then at C What are you supposed to do here	Only minus	sd	3
Yes	So you do eight G minus six G	sd	4
Yes	Uh what do you call those things	sd	3
Uh what do you call those things	Is there a two G	sd	3
Sure	Oh well that is an easy one	sd	1
I will have to look and see how many reservations I have	Yes we too	sd	1
Otherwise I will get in an argument with class two B because they all want to reserve as well	Yes but we are not two B	sd	1
Yes but that is my mentor class	Yes but you cannot play favorites	sd	1
No you are not allowed to play favorites but Im doing it anyway	Well that is not allowed	sd	1
Well that is not allowed	Well sir that is your problem not ours	sv	1
Um what are you supposed to do	I dont know	sd	1
Yes	Draw an axis system	sd	4
Draw an axis system	The ones of A B and C	sd	4
From how far to how far does that axis system need to run	The Xaxis has to go from minus six to eight	sd	4
Very well the Yaxis do you know anything about that	No	b	1
Just imagine something	Um a line like this and a line like that	sd	4
How are you going to plot the equation itself	The lines in there	sd	4
Erik	I dont know	sd	1
You dont know	By calculating those equations	sd	4
Erik	The ones that are shown in the graph uh uh the equations	sd	4
What numbers are you going to fill in for the X	Uh I dont know	sd	1
Uh I dont know	How are you supposed to know that yet	sd	3
I will fill in one for the X	Um that will be um one plus four equals five	sd	5
Um that will be um one plus four equals five	And then times three	sd	5
Exactly	Is 15	aa	4
Just name one	Three	sd	4
What is the outcome then	Seven	sd	4
Three plus four is indeed seven and then	Twentyone	sd	4
Minus six plus four is	Minus two	sd	4
Three times minus two	That is minus six	aa	4
And I will also just fill in eight	Thirtysix	sd	4
Why would I choose minus six and eight	They are uh	sd	1
They are uh	Minus six is at the beginning and eight at the end	sd	4
What is the outcome at eight	Thirtysix	sd	4
Yuck disgusting	No no that ones right as well	sd	1
Is that a pencil or a pen	And a pen	sd	1
And a pen	I dont have a triangular protractor	sd	1
Yes but you can borrow one	No	b	1
You dont either	Yes I do have one but it is at home	sd	1
Yes I do have one but it is at home	Yes I dont have I dont have a uh a triangle but I do have a triangular protractor	sd	1
Yes	No you have to look this one you have to	sv	1
You continued okay	I really dont understand how you do it	sd	3
What is that	No three	sd	4
Twelve plus three is	Fifteen	sd	4
So once you fill in a one for the X well just put a one here somewhere what does that do for the Y	Is that times three	sd	1
Tell me what number you want to fill in	Three	sd	4
You replace the X by a three and then what does it say	Three times three is nine	sd	5
Exactly	Plus 12	sd	4
Is	Twentyone	sd	4
Precisely	That is exactly like the previous one	sd	4
Yes	But then different	sd	4
Try to fill in another number	Um three times eight equals	sd	4
Twentyfour	So then its	sd	1
What do you think the outcome will be	Minus six I think	sd	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
Plus 12	Equals minus six	sd	4
Is it possible that the A and the C are the same	Yes because um	sd	1
Yes because um	No because uh	sd	2
Steffi is it possible	It has to be	sd	4
Three times this four that becomes 12	And three	sd	4
Times	Times	sd	1
Times	Uh no here youve got three times that X and uh	sd	4
Precisely those equations are exactly the same	Do we need to draw it once again	sd	1
So you can add A plus C Yes	Yes	b	1
Those multiplications signs mixing with those Xs	Yes but uh werent Xs always written like this and multiplication signs like that	sd	4
So the equations of A and C are exactly the same	Oh right	b	1
But until youre there youll utilize the multiplication table	Okay	b	1
Yes	So did I also answer B since these are the same	sd	5
Yes what particularity do you notice	Well that the A and the C are the same	sd	5
Yes	Is it true that A and C are the same	sd	1
Yes certainly it is correct	Sir thats the first sentence of	sd	1
You guys have French class later on	Yes we do	sd	1
Test or paper	A test	sd	1
A test	But its really	sd	1
From whom	There are a lot of sentences	sd	1
Ooh	An awful lot	sd	1
An awful lot	It is really difficult you know	sd	1
It is really difficult you know	Yes	b	1
Are you going to put it away now	He told me to	sd	1
He told me to	She snatched it from me	sd	1
Bad girl	Yes really bad	sd	1
That is not allowed is it	Sir can we do Biology then	sd	1
Sir can we do Biology then	Sir today we have a Biology test	sd	1
Sir today we have a Biology test	May we study a little	sd	1
May we study a little	Dont say that because then for Math	sd	1
You guys have a Biology test shortly	Sir shortly we will have reproduction	sd	1
Sir shortly we will have reproduction	We have a lot of labs you know	sd	1
Laboratories	Art	b	1
You made exercise one 15 and 20 in the meantime	No I am I am already beyond that	sd	1
Youve even gotten as far as 36 by now	I will at some point	sd	1
I will at some point	Let me see	sd	1
Uh by the end of this week the chapter has to be completely finished	Oh	b	1
Because next week we will continue with chapter six	Is the additional subject matter tough	sd	1
Which makes this week the last opportunity to ask questions about chapter five	Yes	b	1
Yes	But sir what about the additional subject matter	sd	1
Everything on chapter five	The test when is that	sd	1
The test isnt until the exam week	Ooh	sd	1
Ooh	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Sir are the additional assignments due tomorrow	sd	1
What	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Are the additional assignments due tomorrow as well	sd	1
We will still continue anyway but thats not the intent	Yes	b	1
Yes	We dont have a test	sd	1
We dont have a test	Sir	sd	1
Do cut the French now	Okay	b	1
Okay	But sir  last five minutes	sd	1
Last three minutes	But sir arent we off then sir	sd	1
Do you really think that you can learn something all of a sudden in the last five minutes	Of course	sd	1
Then you might as well do it in the last three minutes	Could you be so kind as to check if	sd	1
Oh uh for Dalton in a moment	Tomorrow we dont have math and Friday is our last day	sd	1
No then it is Friday	A de is not possible I think	sd	1
A de is not possible I think	No that is not possible	sd	1
Whatever you want	No that becomes au	sd	1
Uh who else	Louise and I sir	sd	1
Louise	Yes	b	1
Ah Harley is sick again	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	sd	1
Yes	We have two quizzes coming up	sd	1
We have two quizzes coming up	I have four things dude	sd	1
Yes very difficult	German is what we have then	sd	1
I have a very special one for you three times more difficult	Can I join the class of Harley in that case	sd	1
Hey I want you to finally start doing something now	Huh	b	1
Huh	I am hurrying I am busy	sd	1
You are very busy	That is three times X isnt it	sd	4
Hey just get to work	Sir I dont understand 18	sd	3
Sir I dont understand 18	I am calculating it the other way around	sd	4
I am calculating it the other way around	If I have to calculate a surface area look 45 meters is five meters times eight meters	sd	5
I think that uh 40 is five times eight or 45 is five times nine	Oh right	b	1
But its fine	Im not very good at doing it by heart	sd	1
Uh it is fine that you do it the other way around	Yes because otherwise I cant calculate it too well	sd	1
And now you do	Now lets have a look	sd	1
Now lets have a look	This is exactly a square so that is nine times nine	sv	5
Iris	I cant figure out 18 with that uh Ruben and the orchard and all that	sd	3
How do you calculate a surface area to begin with	Um	b	1
Yes I know but you are the one who is picking it up	Length times width	sd	4
What is the length here	Sixty	b	4
Sixty	Yes	b	1
Yes	Oh no wait 120	sd	4
Do you need to include the B or not	Yes no	aa	1
So you have to take 60 and what are you supposed to subtract from that	Twenty	sd	4
The last part you have to put in between brackets	Sixty minus B in between brackets	sd	4
Even better exactly	Yes	b	1
Is that possible	Yes I dont know	sd	1
Have a look uh at the equations	Yes	b	1
Could they be identical	Over here uh it is uh four by minus 12	sd	4
Yes but over here it has three times in front of it	Yes but over here it has three times behind it	sd	4
Three times the X is	Three X	sd	4
Three times the four is	Twelve	sd	4
It could be the same right	Yes of course	sd	1
So what do you notice and what is the answer for B	That its identical	sd	4
Are you going to show me on Friday that you have completed up to paragraph five	I will	sd	1
Usually on Fridays I have some happy hours left since on Fridays Im sitting here until 11 oclock in the evening anyway	Oh yes then it is party time	sd	1
Are you joining us as well	No	b	1
Why not	Yes I dont know	sd	1
I wish you would	Oh no I have a match for school for soccer	sd	1
I said make sure you are there	Fine then	sd	1
Yes of course	Me too	sd	1
Yes you bet	Five more minutes to go	sd	1
Five more minutes to go	Sir may we study a bit	sd	1
Sir may we study a bit	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Here it says that Robin has a width of 50 centimeters	sd	4
Here it says that Robin has a width of 50 centimeters	That is the length isnt it	sd	4
Yes but that depends on how you look at length and width	Yes but this is the width isnt it	sd	4
Yes but this is the width isnt it	From the top to the bottom	sd	4
Does it matter what you take as the width or the length	Yes sometimes I think it does	sd	4
Three times four is the same as four times three	Yes	b	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
So if they mean something different when they talk about length and width here	No but look over here	sd	1
Yes	Over here is uh suppose that this is the width	sd	1
Yes	Then that is H centimeters then you need to do 50 but if youd turn it around would it still stay the same	sv	5
Then that is H centimeters then you need to do 50 but if youd turn it around would it still stay the same	Oh I see	aa	1
Three times four and four times three is the same	Yes but that is not an H	sd	4
Yes but hey four times three and three times four is the same as well isnt it	Yes thats true	aa	4
Yes thats true	Okay	b	1
Laurie try to keep working just a wee bit longer	We were allowed to study werent we	sd	1
Have the last three minutes started yet	Yes	b	1
Yes	They did for me	sd	1
Look how fast the French books are appearing on the tables now	Sir can I ask you one more thing	sd	1
Yes	This one	sd	1
This one	What is	sd	1
And how much is three times four	Oh right 120	b	4
Three D plus 120	And the aux the AU and X thats what you get with A and plural	sd	1
This is how you use the table	Oh	b	1
That you are kind of blushing	Me	sd	1
Me	I always have that	sd	1
I always have that	No but he said something and then I went like that and then he went like It was kind of funny	sd	1
Good morning um	Yes I have I note	sd	1
A note	Yes	b	1
Do you have it with you	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Where are you coming from	I went to the doctor	sd	1
Where did the braids go	I had such a bad headache	sd	1
Test	Yes I completed some problems but I should think I can get at least a seven and a half	sd	1
What should we bet for	Well the fact that Im doing that test	sd	1
Uh Laurie who else is absent over there	Loes	sd	1
Right Loes	Uh jai mal a la	sd	1
Loes and Laura	Laura	sd	1
What is the date today the 11th	Hey lair isnt that looks like	sd	1
Hey lair isnt that looks like	As in you look sporty	sd	1
Well good luck with uh French	Thanks	b	1
See you soon	Next week	sd	1
I dont want to break your train of thought but whats happening  here	Well see we took the three oranges and the dark green to be one  and then the four blues to be um the fourths and down here we  took three blues and then uh nine whites and we took three whites  which would go to that one so were making a new rod because if  you had one itd be an orange	sd	5
Well see we took the three oranges and the dark green to be one  and then the four blues to be um the fourths and down here we  took three blues and then uh nine whites and we took three whites  which would go to that one so were making a new rod because if  you had one itd be an orange	If you had two other ones itd  be  bigger than an orange so were making a new rod there and we do  the same here and the same here so were making new rods for  thirds	sd	5
Ok	Understand	sd	1
Yes I do	Thats the only problem	sv	1
Thats the only problem	ATually no I do	sd	1
ATually no I do	He was calling  two browns two blacks and two blues a one	sd	1
He was calling  two browns two blacks and two blues a one	Yeah because that was that was the other problem	sd	1
Yeah because that was that was the other problem	Yeah and then the light greens are the twelfths and those are the	sd	4
Yeah and then the light greens are the twelfths and those are the	I think that would be sixteen though	sv	2
I think that would be sixteen though	Yeah and the reds would be the twentyfour twentyfourths the  reds would be the twentyfourths and the white would be the forty eighths	sd	2
What did you get the difference to be	Because he he just doubled everything	sd	5
Because he he just doubled everything	What are the thirds	sd	3
What are the thirds	What are the fourths	sd	3
What are the fourths	ExaTly	b	1
ExaTly	Im just working on mine	sd	1
Im just working on mine	Hes working on that	sd	1
Hes working on that	David thats basically what we came here for	sd	1
Do you understand how you  would get fourths and thirds out of that	David isnt this basically what we came for	sd	1
David isnt this basically what we came for	Hes getting it lined up trying to get it lined up	sd	1
Hes getting it lined up trying to get it lined up	Yeah hes messing up	aa	1
Yeah hes messing up	So basically we dont need this all this	sd	1
So basically we dont need this all this	We  could just push that aside and work with Davids	sd	1
We  could just push that aside and work with Davids	Isnt this basically  what we came here for David	sd	1
Isnt this basically  what we came here for David	And everyone is trying to make another model	sd	1
And everyone is trying to make another model	I know cuz I told	sd	1
Basically you came here for what	We basically came to discuss Davids original model	sd	1
And then they built something else	Yeah we forgot the whole point why we came here	sd	1
Yeah we forgot the whole point why we came here	Yeah I told everybody and then she said to go over there and build  Davids model	sd	1
Yeah I told everybody and then she said to go over there and build  Davids model	And we lost the point for some reason	sd	1
Ok but I dont think David did this	No Davids like here let me do this	sd	1
David how about you explain to me what youre doing so your thinking	Well before Meredith built this other thing and then she had the reds  were one twelfth and then the whites were one twentyfourth but  then	sd	2
Well before Meredith built this other thing and then she had the reds  were one twelfth and then the whites were one twentyfourth but  then	We built that me and alan built that and then they did it and then	sd	2
We built that me and alan built that and then they did it and then	Meredith did too but then uh so then uh she thought to think of a  bigger model then I thought that then maybe the greens would be  something like one twelfth but then we figured out that would be  sixteenths then I put them up there	sd	5
Alright	And	sd	1
And	No it wouldnt this one still has some room	sd	2
No it wouldnt this one still has some room	I think	sv	1
I think	No its just that this	sv	1
No its just that this	Well um and then I thought the  reds would be one twentyfourth and the whites might be one forty eighth	sd	5
Well um and then I thought the  reds would be one twentyfourth and the whites might be one forty eighth	Cuz I just doubled it	sd	5
Did it work out	What	ba	1
I mean did you did you find what you thought you  would find	Well not really because this one was one sixteenth um one  sixteenth	sd	5
And the reds came out to	I was working on that right now	sd	1
Oh ok	What about the purples	sd	3
What about the purples	How about the purples	sd	3
How about the purples	The purples could  come out to be	sd	4
The purples could  come out to be	Yeah they might be the	sd	2
Yeah they might be the	I think the purples would be the purples would probably be twelfths	sd	4
I think the purples would be the purples would probably be twelfths	Alright so now	sd	1
You put a lot of work into it	This isnt going to fit on notebook paper	sd	1
We can take listen we can take this and paste it together and put  your work on	Well it barely even fits on this	sd	1
We can do that	I mean if it doesnt fit on this of course it cant fit on a single piece  of notebook paper but if we put a couple of pieces together	sd	1
What should we	I think maybe I counted wrong but that but I counted it to be one  twentythird	sd	4
I think maybe I counted wrong but that but I counted it to be one  twentythird	Let me count again	sd	1
See if you have it even	One two three four one two three	sd	1
David Im not convinced  theyre lined up	Eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen	sd	1
Eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen	Dave you have something wrong you need another	sd	2
Dave you have something wrong you need another	Twentythree	sd	2
Twentythree	You need to line them up	sd	2
You need to line them up	Here youve got yeah you need another one of that	sd	2
A yardstick might help	Yeah	b	1
See it over there	Now push push push the reds down	sd	1
Now push push push the reds down	Just push em in and then you can get one more	sd	1
Just push em in and then you can get one more	Now put one more on	sd	1
Now put one more on	Take a yardstick and flatten the whole thing out	sd	1
Take a yardstick and flatten the whole thing out	What do you mean flatten it out	sd	1
What do you mean flatten it out	Its all wavy	sd	1
Its all wavy	Yo	b	1
Yo	I just worked	sd	1
I just worked	No I mean its not ok cuz no offense Meredith but isnt this called  the major model were working on	sd	1
No I mean its not ok cuz no offense Meredith but isnt this called  the major model were working on	Thats what were doing	sd	1
Thats what were doing	That s why we came over here	sd	1
That s why we came over here	Ok	b	1
Ok	Pointless	sd	1
Pointless	Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen oops sorry	sd	1
Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen oops sorry	I just  think the purples	sd	4
I just  think the purples	Is that enough	sd	3
Is that enough	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten	This is going to be twelve	sd	4
This is going to be twelve	Eleven Twelve	sd	1
Eleven Twelve	I know it	sd	1
I know it	The purples	sd	4
The purples	Five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve	sd	1
Five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve	There we go	sd	1
There we go	No that  sides	ba	2
No that  sides	You dont really need Wait a minute now I just gotta do the thirds  and fourths	sd	4
You dont really need Wait a minute now I just gotta do the thirds  and fourths	Dont touch anything now	sd	1
Dont touch anything now	One two three four five six	sd	1
One two three four five six	Dont touch anything	sd	1
Dont touch anything	I think the ones would be one fortyeighth	sd	4
I think the ones would be one fortyeighth	Wait four eight twelve just count by fours cuz	sd	4
Wait four eight twelve just count by fours cuz	David and Erik Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen  twenty twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight	sd	4
David and Erik Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen  twenty twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight	Thirty	ba	2
Thirty	Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty  twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight thirty thirtytwo  thirtyfour thirtysix thirtyeight forty fortytwo fortyfour forty six fortyeight	sd	4
Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty  twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight thirty thirtytwo  thirtyfour thirtysix thirtyeight forty fortytwo fortyfour forty six fortyeight	Yep fortyeight	sd	4
Are you surprised that its fortyeight	No thats what I thought it would be	sd	4
Are you going to be able to  write this up	Um well not draw maybe not	sd	1
So you  can start	Cuz I thought the greens were the purples one twelfth	sd	5
Cuz I thought the greens were the purples one twelfth	So I think what Im gonna do	sd	1
So you think the purples one twelfth  is there another name for that  purple	Um one one	sd	4
Meredith knows how to find other names for these	One twelfth	sd	4
Is there another number name for the  purple	One fourth no	sd	4
One fourth no	I mean uh whats it called	sd	4
I mean uh whats it called	Wait	sd	1
If you were using	One whole	sd	4
If let me ask you this	One whole one half	sd	4
Ok David thinks four twelfths	One twelfth	sd	2
One twelfth	One twelfth	sd	2
We know its one twelfth weve proved its one twelfth and youve  proved its one twelfth	Four twentyeighths	sd	4
Four twentyeighths	I mean four fortyeighths	sd	4
Four fortyeighths	Because the whites would be the whites would be fortyeighths and  then and then it takes	sd	5
Because the whites would be the whites would be fortyeighths and  then and then it takes	I didnt mean	sd	1
I didnt mean	Four whites to equal up	sd	4
Four whites to equal up	Four fortyeighths	sd	2
You mean four fortyeighths	I said four fortyeighths	sd	1
You think that makes sense	Four fortyeighths or	sd	4
Four fortyeighths or	One twelfth	sd	2
One twelfth	One twelfth	sd	2
Any other  names	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Two two two twentyfourths	sd	4
Two twentyfourths	Two twenty fourths	sd	1
How many different number names and different  blocks	Well does it have to be the same whole	sd	3
What do you think	It can also be bigger by um	sd	4
It can also be bigger by um	Two or it can be thirds halves it could be a	sd	2
What s one green	Those are sixteenths	sd	4
Those are sixteenths	One sixteenth and one fortyeighth	sd	2
One sixteenth	Or one fortyeighth	sd	4
How did you get sixteenths	Because there are sixteen that line up to the answer	sd	5
Because there are sixteen that line up to the answer	One sixteenth	sd	2
Show me they re sixteen	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen	sd	1
But is the difference between three  quarters and two thirds a green	Is the difference between	sd	4
Is the difference between	Oh a green and blue one fortyeighth	sd	2
So how would what number name would you give for the  differences between	Also the it also could be it would take two of them to equal up to a  brown	sd	5
So I think you could work it out if you worked hard enough	Yeah but I think if you took one sixteenth and one forty eighth and  you put it up to it it	sd	4
Oh so what number name would you give to that	Uh one forty eighth  I dont	sd	4
Michael	Um if you know what youre doing and you know what strategy  you could probably build you could probably build one for every  single rod	sd	4
What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what you  mean by that	You could you could build a thing you could build fractions of  every single rod if you know what youre doing and you have a  strategy or a secret that that you know will work	sv	4
What can be such a secret	Thats what I was trying to figure out	sd	1
How  many do you think	Well we got six	sd	4
You think thats it	No	sd	2
What do you think	Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you divided the  white rod maybe you could make more models that way if you  divided the white rods	sd	5
So youre thinking if you had more different size rods	Yeah yeah	b	1
Graham you can come and help	I dont have fourths in my one that I made	sd	4
Ok you want to tell the class about  what you have there	Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two thirds  and three fourths and we think that three fourths is bigger by one  twelfth	sd	5
Whats one twelfth	Because um twelve whites equal up to this	sd	5
Because um twelve whites equal up to this	Let me show here	sd	1
Are you all convinced	But didnt you say to make a smaller one	sd	1
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	But I dont think thats the smallest one	sd	4
What do you think	Well we just put twelve whites on there and it  takes one white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple  to the three greens	sd	5
Well we just put twelve whites on there and it  takes one white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple  to the three greens	So thats why we think its one twelfth	sd	5
What do you think Erik	Smaller in sizewise	sd	5
Smaller in sizewise	Like size for the thirds the fourths and and  the whole	sd	5
Like size for the thirds the fourths and and  the whole	Smaller by size	sd	5
Brian	Well um the orange and the red	sd	4
Ok	We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller one  because every one you use equals up to an orange and a red and  the secret is that every one has three purples and four greens	sd	5
We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller one  because every one you use equals up to an orange and a red and  the secret is that every one has three purples and four greens	And  so you cant possibly make one smaller because you wont be able  to fit it wont work because every one you make equals up equals  up to the orange and red	sd	5
So youre telling me the six models that you made	Were the same length	sd	4
Thats very  interesting	Well well we could make another model to show that	sd	1
You found  different ways to show one that had the same length as orange and  red	Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact same  length as the other one	sd	2
And what did what was how did she make her train	Yeah thats what I was going to do	sd	2
Yeah thats what I was going to do	Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the third is  purple and the fourths were the dark greens were the light greens	sd	5
Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the third is  purple and the fourths were the dark greens were the light greens	See thats what I did I was gonna make one that was the same  exact size	sd	2
How would  you convince me	Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the part that  theres no theres no other smaller	sd	5
Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the part that  theres no theres no other smaller	I think because at their model  they use the twelfth as the white ones and theres no rod smaller  than the white rod	sd	5
I think because at their model  they use the twelfth as the white ones and theres no rod smaller  than the white rod	So therefore if you make it a rod smaller than  it they cant you cant divide it into twelfths	sd	5
Yeah	Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod possible	sd	5
Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod possible	Unless you made a new rod	sd	4
So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that had  that were smaller than the white rods then you could make a  smaller model Erik	Yeah	b	1
Leave them upside down	I cant believe it	sd	1
I cant believe it	Huh	b	1
Dont say that	It starts with the bell and ends with the bell	sd	1
Hmm	Thats the	ba	1
Ill also try to aim that as best as I can	What about a ruler	sd	1
Pass it back as it is upside down okay	What is upside down	sd	3
Now lets start class	Stand up	sd	1
Stand up	Bow	aa	1
Bow	Onegaishimasu	sd	1
Onegaishimasu	Onegaishimasu	sd	1
How much is in it	One hundred eighty yen	sd	4
One hundred eighty yen	One hundred eighty yen	sd	2
There are only fiveyen coins in it but how much is in it	One hundred and ten yen	sd	4
One hundred and ten yen	One hundred and ten yen	sd	2
Now it goes in from here and in this offertory box	Wow	ba	1
Wow	Thats great	ba	1
Thats great	Thats amazing	sd	1
Is it okay	Theyre in there	sd	1
Which one has more in terms of the amount of money	The older brother	sd	4
Hmm	Ichiro	sd	4
Ichiro	Ichiro	sd	2
How about it in this stage	Ichiro	sd	4
Ichiro	Ichiro	sd	2
You may want to take notes or anything else you want to do is fine so please try doing it	Where are we going to write it	sd	1
Have you already solved at least one	Okay	b	1
Up to wh where have you thought about it	Uh somewhat	sd	1
Did you erase this	Yes	b	1
Yes	I erased that	sd	1
Then how about the second day	I did this like this and	sd	1
Hm	The tens	sd	4
Then try putting in the dates there	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
How did you obtain this	I counted all the way	sd	4
That is	Ichiro	sd	4
Whose amount of money is this	Are you talking about this	sd	1
Yes	Hm	b	1
Hm	Hm	b	1
Hm	This is	sd	1
Then how about over here	Over here is also 90 yen	sd	4
Hm	You minus 10 yen every single day and	sd	4
Yes	Over here every single day	sd	4
Yes	You minus five yen	sd	4
And you obtained this from the table right	Yes	b	1
Okay	No	b	1
Would you present this part	Am I going to write it	sd	1
Im going to have you present it later on	This this what do you call this	qy	3
This is smaller than	What	ba	1
Smaller than	Smaller than	sd	1
Will you do it	Ha ha	sd	1
Ha ha	I guess Ill do it	sd	1
Ha ha	Ha ha	sd	1
Ha ha	What am I supposed to do	sd	3
See	I put them in right	sd	1
Yes	And you keep on putting them in	sd	1
Okay	Its a lot faster if we put in many at a time	sd	4
Its a lot faster if we put in many at a time	is more cool	sd	1
Hmm	Theres a lot of 10yen coins huh	sd	4
Theres a lot of 10yen coins huh	Then last the fiveyen coins go in	sd	4
Then last the fiveyen coins go in	Theyre sticking out	sd	1
Theyre sticking out	huh	sd	1
huh	One two  three four five six	sd	1
One two  three four five six	Huh	b	1
Huh	About this much	sd	4
About this much	About this much	sd	2
Hmm	About this much this time it fell	sd	4
About this much this time it fell	Hmm	sd	1
And please say it okay	No	b	1
By the way what day is this	The fifteenth day	sd	4
How is it	Its okay	sd	1
Its okay	Its okay	sd	1
Okay	Since the fact is they put in the offertory box one coin each of money in one day so	sd	5
Since the fact is they put in the offertory box one coin each of money in one day so	if we do it in an orderly fashion the number of days and also the money left over one by one	sd	5
if we do it in an orderly fashion the number of days and also the money left over one by one	on the fifteenth day the smaller brother has more	sd	5
That means the answer is	The fifteenth day	sd	4
Go ahead	My handwriting is not neat	sd	1
Then please explain it	Well in the beginning	sd	5
Well in the beginning	Well Ichiro had 180 yen and the smaller brother had 110 yen	sd	5
Well Ichiro had 180 yen and the smaller brother had 110 yen	And since there is a difference of 70 yen	sd	5
And since there is a difference of 70 yen	and since the difference between them becomes smaller by five yen each day so its 70 divided by 10 minus five	sd	5
and since the difference between them becomes smaller by five yen each day so its 70 divided by 10 minus five	And since by the fourteenth day it becomes exactly the same amount of money	sd	5
And since by the fourteenth day it becomes exactly the same amount of money	so since on the day after that there will be a difference so 14 plus one is 15 and its the fifteenth day	sd	5
Its okay to not write all the lines of the mathematical expression	Oh	b	1
Okay	Is it okay with this	sd	1
Is it okay with this	Yes	b	1
And if you can write the amount for X	Oh	b	1
Oh	Yes	b	1
Okay	And after Ive written the answer of X and Y	sd	1
Please say	Now	sd	1
Now	One hundred	sd	5
One hundred	In the beginning Ichiro had 180 yen and since he takes out 10 yen every day	sd	5
In the beginning Ichiro had 180 yen and since he takes out 10 yen every day	And we have X as the num number of days and if we make the amount of money left Y	sd	5
And we have X as the num number of days and if we make the amount of money left Y	Then it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 180 minus 10 X	sd	5
Then it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 180 minus 10 X	And the smaller brother has 110 yen every day	sd	5
And the smaller brother has 110 yen every day	Oh	b	5
Oh	He has 110 yen	sd	5
He has 110 yen	And since he takes out five yen every day it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 110 minus five X	sd	5
And since he takes out five yen every day it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 110 minus five X	And when they become of the same amount of money and	sd	5
And when they become of the same amount of money and	And X and Y becomes 14 and 40	sd	5
And X and Y becomes 14 and 40	And on the fourteenth day they become the same amount of money	sd	5
And on the fourteenth day they become the same amount of money	And the fourteenth day is the same amount of money	sd	5
And the fourteenth day is the same amount of money	And the next day since Ichiro puts in 10 yen and the smaller brother puts in five yen so theres a difference	sd	5
And the next day since Ichiro puts in 10 yen and the smaller brother puts in five yen so theres a difference	The amount of money put in is smaller for Ic Ichiro	sd	5
The amount of money put in is smaller for Ic Ichiro	Oh	b	5
Oh	Its bigger so	sd	5
Its bigger so	the next day Ichiro Ichiros amount of money left is less so it becomes the fifteenth day	sd	5
Go ahead	Smaller	sd	4
Smaller	Smaller	sd	2
Smaller	What came after that	sd	3
Okay	Smaller than	sd	4
Smaller than	One hundred eighty minus	sd	4
Yes	Ten X smaller than	sd	4
Yes	One hundred ten minus five X	sd	4
Then well can you say why you got a mathematical expression like this	Um	b	1
Um	The one labeled X is that one day after they finished their prayers and	sd	4
Yes	And on that day since the smaller brothers amount of money is bigg oh was bigger than his big brother	sd	5
And on that day since the smaller brothers amount of money is bigg oh was bigger than his big brother	well Ichiros so in short well Ich Ic who had 180 yen	sd	5
well Ichiros so in short well Ich Ic who had 180 yen	Huh	b	1
Huh	Ichiro is one second in short in short the difference in the amounts of money on that one day	sd	5
Yes	The fact is the smaller brothers amount of money is more than Ichiros and	sd	4
Yes	And the person who had 110 yen is the amount of money the smaller brother had in the beginning	sd	5
And the person who had 110 yen is the amount of money the smaller brother had in the beginning	So the smaller brothers is bigger and Kazu oh Ichiros is smaller	sd	5
That means in this situation the values of the left side and the right side which is greater	The left side	sd	4
That means can we say that putting in 13 for X holds true for this inequality	We cant say it	sd	4
We cant say it	We cant say it	sd	2
When you com compare them	Its greater	sv	4
Numbers that are what than 14	Greater	sd	4
But the answer that one day is it just the fifteenth day	From 15	sd	4
Hm	Its from the fifteenth day up to the eightee eighteenth day	sd	4
How about the nineteenth day	Its not included	sd	4
Its not included	Since Ichiros wallet becomes empty and	sd	5
Yes	at that time theyll end it	sd	4
Now then since it would be poured rapidly the amount of juice increases like this right	Wow	ba	1
Okay	Then Choshi	sd	2
Okay	Yes	b	1
Yes	For Ichiro	sd	1
Yes	to pour more than the smaller brothers	sd	4
to pour more than the smaller brothers	the amount needed for that	sd	4
Then did you understand that one just now	I dont understand	sd	3
Then would you point with your finger	Huh	b	1
Where is it	In short here is 50 milliliters so	sd	4
Yes	Lets have it so we need up to 80 milliliters and up to here	sd	4
Yes	Up to here	sd	4
Yes	That amount I think we should make X	sv	4
In this situation	The increased amount	sd	4
How about over here	Eighty	sd	4
And which is more	Over here	sd	4
Would you try saying it	Yes	b	1
Yes	Fifty plus X	sd	4
Yes	bigger than	sd	4
Which	bigger than	sd	4
Okay	eighty	sd	4
Go ahead	More than	sd	4
Yes	Thirty	ba	4
Then if we say one between these	Thirty point one	sd	4
Its thirty point one	Ahh	aa	1
Anything else	Thirty	ba	4
Thirty	Thirty point one	sd	2
Thirty point	One one	sd	4
Anything else	Thirty point one one one	sd	2
But about how many are there	Infinite	sd	4
Infinite	Infinite	sd	2
Is thirty included or not included	Its included	sd	4
Its included	Its not included	sd	2
Then for now well end	Stand up	sd	1
Stand up	Bow	aa	1
Bow	Thank you very much	aa	1
Okay	Do we copy everything from here	sd	1
And if so you guys can find the error and fix it that will help guide you towards what you need	Okay	b	1
You good Max	Yeah	b	1
So its again its just a status poster so Im not looking for solutions yet	Okay	b	1
Okay	Do we have to fill this out	sd	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
But this can kind of guide and almost help you come to a different conclusion based off of what they found	Okay	b	1
So Gerry  it looks like you kind of have a better step than Gerry but he still has some insight	Do we have to like write it down	sd	1
Yeah Id write it down because whatever you dont write down now youre going to have to	Is it recommended or is it	sd	1
Yes	But is it	sd	1
Like strongly recommended	But like do we have to do it	sd	1
But like do we have to do it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Lets do it	sd	1
Lets do it	Ready	sd	1
Ready	Is it mandatory	sd	1
Im going to let you decide that	Okay so we used Heathers	sd	1
My group of winners	and guessed what the  we didnt like guess but we found what the question mark would be	sd	4
So you used Heather	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So we saw this and we were like Oh lets find what the question mark would be	sd	5
So we saw this and we were like Oh lets find what the question mark would be	And its the wide diameter	sd	5
So what is the W then	The wide diameter	sd	4
So why would she put two different variables for the same thing	What do you mean	qy	3
So you said the question mark is the wide diameter	Oh yeah no	b	1
Oh yeah no	So like I dont think she knew what it actually was but we found out that the one that works is	sd	2
I see what youre saying okay	is the wide diameter	sd	4
She knew that there was something that had to be multiplied but she didnt know what number it was	Yeah	b	1
Now did you also take into account Gerry and Judi	We looked at Judis and thats kind of what we were thinking	sd	1
Okay	but	sd	1
All right	Okay	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Here	sd	1
Here	So one of them it was going like one three one four one five one six	sd	5
So one of them it was going like one three one four one five one six	So for this one we did four four four five four six four seven	sd	5
So for this one we did four four four five four six four seven	Does that make sense	sd	1
So youre using the numbers but if you didnt have the numbers what would you say is changing	So you want us to look at like the actual data	sd	4
And the W stands for the	The wide	sd	4
Whats happening with the wide diameter	Oh	b	1
Oh	Its  is it  are some of them skewed though like	sd	4
Okay	Oh	b	1
Oh	Its increasing by one	sd	4
So how would you describe what her strengths are	Okay	b	1
Okay yeah	Wait wait so real quick	sd	1
Real quick	So do you want us to like go through and answer all these and then continue like I dont know like trying to	sd	1
Trying to make the poster	Well like  Im still trying to like figure like  something out that like makes the  works a little bit	sd	1
Well like  Im still trying to like figure like  something out that like makes the  works a little bit	Its so frustrating	sd	1
Its so frustrating	This is like so close and then like so far away	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
So you know start to finish whats your status	Okay	b	1
And doesnt need to be spiffy but I do need to be able to see it from far away	Okay	b	1
So youre using the student work to answer these questions because	not a good answer	sd	1
not a good answer	Lets see the	sd	1
Lets see the	So you get R	sd	4
So you get R	And solve for it	sd	2
And solve for it	And see if it works	sd	4
And see if it works	R plus three is R minus five over two	sd	5
I want you to do both problems	You can call it one fourth  Brian C  One fourth	sd	4
You can call it one fourth  Brian C  One fourth	One fourth	sd	4
One fourth	This is two and this is this	sd	4
Let s see if you fall into the trap	is one	sd	4
is one	This is one fourth one fourth and this is one half	sd	4
This is one fourth one fourth and this is one half	One fourth one half	sd	4
One fourth one half	Brian C One fourth and one half	sd	4
Brian C One fourth and one half	Jacquelyn This is one whole and this is two	sd	4
But you did make it	No	b	1
Did you at least bring your books	Yes	b	1
Well Ill make a note of it	Theres a couple of assignments that I didnt get back yet	sd	1
Which ones	The two of the additional exercises two B three and four	sd	1
The two of the additional exercises two B three and four	I didnt even get to do any of the additional exercises Miss	sd	1
I didnt even get to do any of the additional exercises Miss	Because I had a catchup test  I didnt have any time left to do this	sd	1
So youre at two now	Yes two B	sd	1
Are you going to catch up with that before the next class	Yes	b	1
Yes	I didnt do the additional exercise at all	sd	1
Because	Because	sd	1
Because	But I did do this	sd	1
This one you did make	Yes	b	1
You too Arnela	Eh	aa	1
Did it work out	Well except for the last one	sd	1
Sorry	Is that for Wednesday	sd	1
Is that for Wednesday	Yes	sd	1
Twentythree	Im starting	sd	1
Very cozy how you chose to sit in the back like that	That way I can see better	sd	1
so Im curious to know whether you succeeded in making this type of equation alongside a graph	I succeeded	sd	1
You succeeded	Yes	b	1
Beautiful	I didnt	sd	1
Linda	No way	sd	1
No way	Make my day	sd	1
Marion did you succeed	Yes a little bit	sd	1
A little bit	Not exactly	aa	1
Not exactly	No	b	1
Um Simon what did you get	Uh	b	1
Uh	Nothing	sd	1
What is your answer to question 23 A	Oh I dont have that one	sd	1
Whats the equation	Twentythree	sd	4
Peter	Y times zero point five plus one equals X	sd	4
Y times zero point five	Plus one	sd	4
times zero point five and then	Plus one	sd	4
And then	Equals X	sd	4
Equals X	Uh Y is three plus one times X	sd	4
One plus	A half	sd	4
A half	Times X	aa	4
Okay Stefan	Y is a half times X plus one	sd	4
Y is a half times X plus one	I have that	sd	2
What do you notice about these last two equations	They are the same	sd	4
They are the same	The other way around	sd	2
Maarten	The Y is reversed	sd	4
How can you see that in the diagram	The vertical line	sd	4
Arnela would you like to try one	Um	b	1
Which of those four equations would you like to do	Lets do um A perhaps	sd	1
Okay try to explain to me which one of these four lines belongs to that	Uh well personally I thought it might be one	sd	4
Explain why	Well because it uh well I thought that those black lines crossed the vertical line at four	sd	5
This line is a descending line can you also tell that from the equation	descending value	sd	4
Yes	And the one the least was subtracted from thats the number one	sd	4
Descending lines	Um A and D	sd	4
Ricardo how can you see if an equation belongs with a descending line	It runs like this	sd	4
But how can you tell that from the equation	If it has a little minus mark	sd	4
Yes but where does the minus mark have to be	It has to be um it has to be um in front of the slope	sd	4
Are you still able to see that or not	Not really	sd	1
What is the starting number of A	Um four	sd	4
What is the starting number of D	D	b	1
Um Arnold	Uh B is three and you add that	sd	4
I dont see any zero here	No	sd	1
What is the deal with that	Uh one	ba	1
No but I would like to have a word with you shortly Charles	Thats fine	ba	1
Maarten	You dont have to write the zero down	sd	4
Um Casper why dont you name one	In scuba diving	aa	4
Excuse me	In scuba diving	aa	4
In The Netherlands or uh somewhere	In France	sd	1
Well well	Well soon Im going to dive with my  at a diving beach	sd	1
And what else did we come across	Cell phones	aa	4
Then you have a starting number that is the starting amount that you pay for the subscription and how much per unit is added	The braking distance	sd	4
Excuse me	The braking distance	sd	4
Was that linear	No	b	1
Yes that was not a linear relationship	The skating	sd	4
Yes we looked at that	Alcohol checks	sd	4
That is for tomorrow	Can you pass me a sheet	sd	1
And in case you didnt complete page 52 yet	Thats an awful lot	sd	1
Thats an awful lot	Yes	b	1
Those are two pages yes	Yes	b	1
Who can I give the pleasure of an answer booklet	Yes	b	1
Uh tomorrow I will have a look at notebooks again by the way	By the way	sd	1
If not then Ill have a neat surprise	Oh wed love a neat surprise	sd	1
I thought that you were you were going to make an appointment with me yesterday	What	ba	1
But you were gone at the end of class	A double appointment	sd	1
Why dont you just remain seated for a moment at the end of class okay	Yes	b	1
And your notebook	Ive made all the assignments	sd	1
Next time I want to check your notebook to see if everything is in there	Teacher may I	sd	1
How far are you	At 26	sd	1
Sorry	Twentysix	sd	1
Then keep going with it	I am already at the additional exercises	sd	1
Your homework is not in order	No I didnt understand it	sd	1
Will it be done tomorrow	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes tomorrow it will be finished	sd	1
Excellent so for now you better get on top of it	Teacher	b	1
Yes	I would love to have my grade of my math paper	sd	1
And you are not sure yet either	I dont understand problem 25	sd	3
Write down a linear equation in which you can calculate how much well	I dont understand that	sd	3
What do you need for a linear equation	Oh uh the starting number and the slope	sd	4
How do you find that in	Two hundred thats	ba	4
Well you just had the letters the wrong way around	Yes	b	1
Which letter is the outcome	Uh Y	sd	4
Uh what letter shall we pick for that	The amount of water or something	sd	5
Well multiply it by one letter just one letter	H	b	1
H Okay H equals is a good way to start	H equals	aa	1
The slope or uh the starting number always comes all the way at the end	Yes	b	1
So it is	Positive	sd	4
So do you add it up or do you subtract it	Add it up	sd	4
No this will be this will become one equation	Oh	aa	1
Where do you have the other one	Yes it looks kind of sloppy	sd	1
Yes that one you should write down a little more neatly because its difficult to reconstruct this way	Let me see X	sd	1
That was zero point five times X simply X	Something like this	sd	1
You already have H equals that is the same as this	H equals and then the slope	sd	4
Now you still have to	Insert the slope	sd	4
Correct	That is let me see that is minus that is minus one oh that is minus	sd	4
How many steps do you have to go down then	Uh hang on also also 10	sd	4
Where are we	At 100	sd	4
At 100	At the hu like this at the 100 one four steps	sd	4
Thats this point	Oh that point	sd	1
Here it lies at the 10 and here it lies at the	One hundred twentyfive	sd	4
That has gotten how many times smaller	Ten	sd	4
Divided by 10	One hundred twentyfive divided by 10 is twelveandahalf	sd	5
Okay and this is the vector number or the slope	Oh	b	1
Did you also have a question	Yes	b	1
Yes	I um I was sick yesterday so I dont have 12 through 19	sd	1
And did it work out	Well no I still need to do that	sd	1
Where exactly are you	Right now	b	1
Which problem did you complete	At 27	sd	1
And this one you havent done	Right I skipped that one	sd	1
That is impossible because then you dont understand those yet	Yes a little bit I do find it to be quite difficult	sd	1
But at what problem did you end	At 12	sd	1
And dont do the additional exercises for tomorrow instead you just go as far as time allows you to	Yes	b	1
Preferably more than two pages otherwise you will fall behind even more	Yes okay	aa	1
I will make an appointment with you later because yes no I think that you are working badly	I already made that one	sd	1
Well at least sit straight and get to work please	Teacher I have been checking the wrong chapter I thought	sd	1
I want the both of you to write down a clarification for yourselves at problem 27	Okay	b	1
So that you explain to yourself why that line is there otherwise you will never find it back	Okay	b	1
Hm	Yes I know because I came to A has the starting number four	sd	5
That way you can see it very clearly	Yes because that ones lower that other one	sd	5
Why dont you close problem 27 in your book and grab your notebook and write down the equations of these four lines	Equations	aa	1
Uh huh	Y equals	sd	4
Simon I also have a nice little assignment for you	Y equals four	sd	4
Oh yes	But I am busy correcting	sd	1
Here I have drawn Simon four lines here	Right	b	1
Would you like to give that a try	Sure	b	1
Yes maybe your neighbor would like to join as well	Yes he does	sd	1
The green one is not very legible	Times three	sd	4
Times three	You mean times minus three	sd	2
You mean times minus three	No its minus three times	sd	2
No its minus three times	Hello	sd	1
Hello	Four minus three	sd	2
Four minus three	No I know that	sd	1
It is good practice	We dont really understand it	sd	3
We dont really understand it	I think	sv	1
I think	I understood it but now I dont understand it anymore	sd	3
Take a line	Okay A	b	1
Okay A	A line one	sd	1
What do you need to know before you can make an equation	The starting number and  number	sd	4
Go ahead and see if you can find the starting number and the slope	I have four and minus three	sd	4
I have four and minus three	But how can you place that in the equation	sd	3
But how can you place that in the equation	Yes	b	1
How do you start your equation	Y	b	4
Well why dont you write that down	Thats what we have	sd	1
Well great then lets see what you have	I have Y is four	sd	4
Y is four and this I cant read	Yes	b	1
It shows a hyphen	Yes I had X times X or so	sd	4
Minus three is	Yup I also have that	sd	1
Yup I also have that	Minus three is	sd	4
What comes after that	No but that is not possible	sd	2
No because you started with Y equals	Yes	b	1
So youve already got equals	Oh okay	b	1
Y equals four X minus minus three	Minus three	sd	1
Minus three	I have that too	sd	1
Okay	And then what	sd	3
Then do the red line	Oh is this one finished already	sd	1
Oh is this one finished already	Yes is this	sd	1
And then you are done	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay uh	b	1
Okay uh	Y equals	sd	4
Y equals	Y equals five	sd	2
Y equals five	Isnt it three	sd	2
Isnt it three	Were going from line two	sd	1
Come on	Y equals five	sd	4
Y equals five	Um	b	1
Um	Times	sd	4
Times	Five times X minus minus three	sd	2
Five times X minus minus three	No that is not possible because since then youve got	sd	2
No that is not possible because since then youve got	No minus one two yes though minus three	sd	2
No minus one two yes though minus three	And then	sd	3
And then	Teacher we got the second one too	sd	1
What and what is it	Well I am not saying anything	sd	1
Well I am not saying anything	I got it though	sd	1
Yes	Y equals five times minus three X minus three	sd	4
Okay what is the vector number the slope	Minus three	sd	4
Okay you should always begin with	Uh Y equals five	aa	4
Uh Y equals five	Well because that is the starting number	sd	5
Youve also put it at the end over here	No because four is the starting number	sd	5
Yes it is the wrong way around	But you just said that it was correct	sd	1
No the the the starting number is always the independent variable that is written at the end	This is what I drew how I	sd	1
Yes that four is added in every step	So then this is also this is also the wrong way around	sd	1
So then this is also this is also the wrong way around	That la two	sd	1
Yes it is the wrong way around	Oh and the last one too	sd	1
And the last one	Y equals minus three	sd	4
Right	Uh times	sd	4
Uh times	Times five	sd	2
Times five	No no no times X minus five	sd	2
Why dont you begin by writing down Y equals	Y equals minus three	sd	4
Y equals minus three	Doesnt it	sd	1
Yes	X or no minus four four X four	sd	4
But when its on the upper side than it is plus	Yes but you dont have to write the plus down	sd	1
Write it down again write it down again	This number one	sd	1
Yes	Y is	sd	4
Yes	Minus three	sd	4
Yes	X um minus four	sd	4
It is located on the upper side	Oh no it is four four	sd	4
And something has to be inserted	Yes but thats what I cant figure out	sd	1
Is it a positive four or a negative four	Oh plus four	sd	4
Oh plus four	X plus four	sd	2
Yes	But in the book it is shown differently	sd	1
This way is correct	Three X and I put this here	sd	4
Correct	Okay	b	1
Is it working or not	Yes with the red one	sd	1
Tell me about it	That is the	sd	1
No	No because thats the slope	sd	5
And then over here is the	Starting number	sd	4
That goes over here	That has to be the other way around	sd	4
It is a totally different equation	Yeah	b	1
Lets see where is the diagram	Right there	aa	1
Is it a positive or a negative number	A negative number because it goes down	sd	5
I am talking only about this point	Positive	sd	4
Now do the black one	Teacher you are not explaining it correctly because the book says something else	sd	1
This is exactly the same thing as is shown over there except in a different sequence	Okay	b	1
Yes	So we should do it in this manner	sd	1
That gives you some grip on it	Begin with the starting number	sd	4
What	Do you have to start with the slope	sd	1
So well put this one down that is also allowed we are going to put that at the end but look the slope multiplied by A	Yes and then what	sd	3
but you did starting number times X	Oh yes thats at the end	sd	4
Then you can help each other out every time	Or spy	sd	1
For example yes	The slope	sd	4
The slope	And then the starting number	sd	4
Eh two four six seven	And then	sd	3
And then	What do you mean And then	sd	3
What do you mean And then	Starting number	sd	4
Starting number	Yes	b	1
Yes	But didnt you always have to	sd	1
Yes	I dont quite get four	sd	3
The first way was	A table	sd	4
How can you tell by looking at the table whether they are linear	When theyre all equal steps	sd	4
And the other way we observed yesterday well we said to each other that we could also check which ones are not linear	No that is two	sd	4
Do you remember that series we just wrote down	You have to square it	sd	4
But if you say you find those tables easier because that way you dont have to memorize them that is just as well	With that with that letter thats not minus either	sv	4
With that with that letter thats not minus either	is it	aa	1
Very true that is not linear either very good	C is not linear either then	sd	4
And the other two if you if you have a good look you can recognize it because you may see something that looks like a starting number and a slope	Hers is not correct of course	sd	2
or you do it with a table and you say that each time equal amounts are added so therefore it is	Okay	b	1
Yes	Y is minus twoandahalf X minus twoandahalf X and the starting number is	sd	3
Y equals so far so good	The starting number is four	sd	4
From that what line did we have here	The black one	sd	4
Very good and now the slope	I thought it was minus onethird	sd	4
Yes	All right	aa	1
Draw it with pencil and a triangular protractor	Teacher do I have to so far I have as starting number	sd	1
How do you always find the starting number	Um where it where it intersects	sd	4
What line does it have to cut and its not intersecting it is cutting	Oh the the	sd	1
Yes yes	One the one	sd	4
Very good yes	And then the slope is two	sd	4
If you go one step to the right	Yes well arent you arent you supposed to go down like that	sd	4
What should I do to end up on to the black line again	One half for example	sd	4
I will have a look at those tomorrow yes	All right all right	aa	1
See you all tomorrow	See you tomorrow	aa	1
We will start nicely we will start with Gregoire With A X plus five equals eight	Well we must take away five	sd	4
We do minus five	We do minus five therefore X is equal to three	sd	5
Guillaume	Er X plus three is equal to minus five	sd	5
Er X plus three is equal to minus five	We must take away er minus three	sd	5
So we mustnt take away minus three	It makes minus three	sd	4
So we must add minus three or do minus three	It makes minus three	sd	4
It makes minus three	And X is equal to eight to minus eight	sd	4
Er Florence	Er X minus six equals 30	sd	5
Er X minus six equals 30	Therefore we do plus six which means X equals 36	sd	5
Katia	Er well er the solution is five	sd	4
What do we do to make our equation equivalent	I did three times five	sd	5
I did three times five	The first is 15 then the second is two times five plus five	sd	5
So there youre groping about	Yeah	b	1
Herve	To take away the Xs	sd	4
Yes	X is equal to something	sd	4
Valentine	We do minus two X	sd	4
We do minus two X	Well there it stays one X to the three X	sd	4
Three X minus two X makes one X	the two X and then er	sd	4
It suppresses the two X and what stays	What stays is X is equal to plus five	sd	4
Aurore what can we say for E	We do minus four X	sd	4
Which gives us X equal to	Minus eight	sd	4
We will come to this side	Well er since we want to eliminate the eight well since we want to find X we put we do plus eight X	sd	5
So if we do plus eight X What happens if we do plus eight X	Ha yeah	b	1
What do we want	There should be one X	sd	4
So Camille	Nine X	sd	4
In doing plus nine X in doing plus nine X whats interesting is that here we have X because plus nine X minus eight X	It makes X	sd	4
It makes X is equal to	Seventeen	sd	4
So for G we have three X plus five is is equal to two X Ludivine	Minus	sd	4
Minus	Minus 30	sd	4
Minus 30	Yeah	b	1
Okay so we can do it all in one stage	No	b	1
So what do we want to do first	Minus two	sd	4
And then it gives us	X plus five	sd	4
X plus five is equal to	Minus three	sd	4
Whats bothering us	Minus five	sd	4
Its the five which is bothering us therefore we do	Minus five	sd	4
Therefore X is equal to	Minus 35	sd	4
What must we choose first	Minus 17	sd	4
So on the right we only have the	The numbers	sd	4
Its	Minus 24	sd	4
Therefore what must I do to take away this minus 24	Plus 24	sd	4
Therefore the 18 X that Im going to subtract minus 17 X theres going to stay	X	b	4
Theres enough to amuse oneself until 957	Sir	sd	1
Yes	949 I dont need to	sd	1
But youve done it right here	But yes but A we did with you	sd	1
But yes but A we did with you	And er here B	sd	1
Yeah you want to isolate you want to isolate what	Er I yeah but I havent understood	sd	3
Its that one there	Yeah therefore I do minus	sd	4
How do you get minus seven to become zero	Er I do plus plus eight er	sd	4
Er I do plus plus eight er	Plus seven	sd	4
The two Xs will stay there	Two X is equal to seven	sd	4
Minus 19 when theres plus seven it makes minus 12	Uhum	b	1
Youve badly written the things but your calculation is correct	Yeah	b	1
Now you want that only that only X therefore you	Times a half	sd	4
You find X equals minus six	Yeah I did it correctly	sd	1
Whats bothering you	The five	sd	1
Therefore	I do plus minus five	sd	4
find 20 minus five it equals well	Fifteen	sd	4
And then you must divide by no you must dividetheres not 15 which must you must simply divide by	Twenty	sd	4
By	By a quarter	sd	4
You must find 15 quarters as a solution	Sir	sd	1
Yes	The thing  must it always be on the left	sd	1
Not necessarily you can also put it on the right	Always X on the left	sd	4
will have minus one X so we must multiply again by minus one	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Its always the same thing 949	sd	4
So what will you be staying with	We inverse	sd	4
We inverse	Bah	b	1
Bah	Three X	sd	4
Three X	48	sd	4
Three X three X equals	Fortyeight	b	4
Fortyeight	No er 36	sd	4
And then you can do times	A third	sd	4
So were going to do additions and multiplications together	Ah	b	1
Ah	Yeah okay	b	1
Its okay	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Theres a problem with C	sd	4
Whats the problem with C	I cant I cant do it C	sd	1
Take away five	Yeah	b	1
So what happens when you take away five	Oh well there also it goes away	sd	4
The four X stays	Yeah	b	1
When four objects are worth 15 francs what do you do to know the price of an object	Well I divide by er four	sd	4
Well I divide by er four	Ah	b	1
Ah	Yeah	b	1
X equals fifteen over four	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How	aa	3
Yes	There if we divide by four the plus five must also be divided by four	sd	5
Therefore we dont divide by four	No	b	1
No	If we take away the five afterwards we have four X is equal to 15	sd	5
And then	And then we can	sd	1
Then its not divided by four fifteen	Yes but it does have decimal points	sd	4
Ho poor little one if it does have decimal points are they so painful decimal points	No	b	1
Ha good	But Sir	sd	1
Exactly	seventyfive  the fraction	sd	4
Youve divided 15 by four thats 15 quarters	Er	sd	1
So thats annoying because you	do three	sd	1
You have already done the next one but we do times one third then we will find	Third	sd	4
Third	Uh	b	1
X is equal to	Twelve	sd	4
But what do you do here	Er plus seven	sd	4
What are you going to find	Er 12 X is equal to seven	sd	4
Minus 19 plus seven	Yeah we must add that yeah well 26	sd	4
Yeah we must add that yeah well 26	Er 25	sd	4
Then after that what do we do	Times one	sd	4
You want to take away the two	Yeah well times a second	sd	4
Which will give we take away the X X equals	Equals is equal to	sd	1
Mental calculation	Yes I know	aa	1
Twelve divided by two the minus it stays	Minus six	sd	4
Therefore here you must still put X is equal to 12 and here you must put X is equal to minus six	Minus six	sd	4
Minus six	Thank you	sv	1
What is it	How do we go about for the two	sd	3
How do we go about for the two	Because I can do it but in two stages	sd	4
We never said one should do only one stage	a half	sd	4
a minimalist either	When we put there er we always first try to take away the part er on the right	sd	4
To avoid the minuses but one can do it in both cases	Sir	sd	1
Yes	There now Ive found for half of X I will multiply by two to find X	sd	4
Youve done a multiplication and a subtraction at the same time	Well you said it was	sd	1
You want X on its own	Thats the least difficult	sd	1
Therefore whats bothering you here	Minus seven	sd	4
And then we find two X is equal to	Minus 12	sd	4
And now we do one stage where we do times a	Half	sd	4
Its on the left so whats bothering us	The minus five	sd	4
Two X minus 16	Thirteen	sd	4
Valentine	So we put the bar and we do minus er minus two X	sd	4
So we put the bar and we do minus er minus two X	Times a half	sd	4
So why do times a half	To do a	sd	1
Were going to write what Herve said then were going to look at how we can complicate a problem which wasnt too complicated to start with	We can	sd	1
Two X	No half of X	sd	4
No	No	b	1
No	Ive got an idea	sd	1
Ive got an idea	Times half X	sd	4
Do you insist	No	b	1
Therefore for the first we shall say what	We can do	sd	1
We can do both at the same time	We can put them one after the other	sd	4
So there one can put them one after the other because its two additions	All right	aa	1
All right	Are we obliged to do them both at the same time	sd	1
because minus two X minus five	Minus one	sd	4
Minus	Minus	sd	1
Minus	Minus 18	sd	2
Minus 18	But how much is it when one does minus 13 minus five	sd	3
But how much is it when one does minus 13 minus five	Minus 18	sd	4
Well minus 13 minus five youve got 13 objects missing someone asks you for five more youve got 18 missing	Ha yeah	b	1
Ha yeah	divided by two	sd	4
It seems to me I dont know And then after	Divided by a half	sd	4
No	Not divided times a half yeah	sd	4
X is equal to	Minus nine	sd	4
Yes	Er there how do we do it	sd	3
No	Its wrong	sd	4
Its wrong	Ha yeah nine is wrong	sd	4
Ha it was three X actually	Yeah	b	1
Ha yeah	It makes it makes seven	sd	4
You write again the object when youve taken away the brackets	Yeah okay	b	1
You do here the thing like this you can say Im doing literal calculation	Yeah	b	1
And then I find four X minus five is equal to six 27 Then now I can work as I did before	Six X over 27	sd	4
Six X over 27	but now if we do minus six X to pass it on this side  to minus two	sd	4
We have minus yeah	Well then we do minus four X and we pass	sd	4
What changes for you	Nothing	sd	1
But finally as far as efficiency in what well want to do later on to find problems resolve problems it doesnt take us very far	And after we do it like that	sd	1
No you cant After what must you do	On that	sd	1
And what will we get	Well its minus 32	sd	4
Therefore	Times a half	sd	4
Thirtytwo over two	Therefore there it makes minus 16	sd	4
Minus 16 is equal to X	Ha yeah	b	1
Anyway one writes S equals so whether one has X equals minus 16 or minus 16 equals X	Yeah it doesnt matter	sd	4
All right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Sir	sd	1
Sir	One cant have zero X	sd	4
No it would be better not to have zero X because then were not well	But because there it gives us zero X if we do minus 17 X	sd	5
Well yeah	It takes away each time er	sd	4
Wait lets look if youve already taken	Ha yeah it makes	sd	4
You do minus 17 X	I do minus 17 only	sd	4
Therefore you find two here	Yeah	b	1
So now	But its wrong but its not possible	sd	4
So its not wrong its that this equation doesnt have a solution	Wah	sd	1
Yes but that is the set containing the empty set therefore its no longer empty	Ha ha what does that mean	sd	3
Ha ha what does that mean	It means	sd	1
The word there that symbol means empty set	So when theres when theres when its impossible I must put only that	sd	4
So when theres when theres when its impossible I must put only that	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Sir	sd	1
Thats right yeah	E I understand very well	sd	1
Is there anywhere here where theres a minus five X	Well no but to have X alone	sd	4
Is it X which is bothering you	Yeah	b	1
I dont do minus five X	I do minus X	sd	4
Yes	Is it possible that equations dont work like that one	sd	1
Where are you there	At	sd	1
At	Its not possible	sd	1
Its not possible	If four X is equal to four X	sd	4
No its not possible	So what do we put	sd	3
Do something	Well yeah but	b	1
You must do minus four X	Yeah	b	1
Ill come back	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Er here what do we do	sd	3
You do minus 15	Yeah	aa	1
Eleven minus 15	Is it correct here if I put this	sd	3
Is it correct here if I put this	the minus four the over four its also here	sd	4
Herve said where I divide first then after you have 15 quarters with 11 quarters	Well we must do minus 15	sd	4
At the first isolate the X or multiply them by X	There four X er four X	sd	4
Well you take away four X	But	sd	1
Possible not possible	Impossible	aa	4
S equals	Well Q something	sd	4
The slash in the middle	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Sir	sd	1
Sir	After can one do times 15	sd	4
So after when you have the four X alone you can do times a quarter	Sir	sd	1
Yes	But no Sir	sd	1
Im coming Im coming	Is it possible that	sd	1
No because if you do plus five X youve got X here but five X here also	Ha yeah	b	1
Ha yeah	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Is it right that one	aa	1
Is it right that one	That one also	sd	1
You havent eliminated your Xs	But no but if I eliminate that one after that one has minus something	sd	5
After well do minus something	Is this correct	sd	1
Well look at this all together please	Ah	b	1
Ah	No no no	sd	1
Therefore you go from minus four X to X I do plus five X right or wrong	Yes	b	1
Yeah so she says to herself Im going to do plus five X then at the same time you do minus 15 all right	Yeah	b	1
So then I write this	copycat	sd	1
Who said that copycat	Me	b	1
You also want to do that	Well yeah	b	1
In a global way whats bothering me	The 15	sd	4
So I do only the minus 15 and I find minus four X is equal to	Then we do times times a quarter	sd	4
Haha	Minus a quarter	sd	4
But whats bothering me also	Its the minus	sd	4
That one there doesnt bother me	Times minus a quarter	sd	4
There are already enough in here you must not look for others	250	sd	4
To do calculations you must take away the brackets	And is that all	sd	3
Then after you do the same problem	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Can you come and see	sd	1
So we will start there I go round like this	Er here there we do times 10 that like after we have no more commas here	sd	4
Exactly	is it correct	sd	1
I dont know if its correct but	We do plus	sd	4
If you take away two X and then youve got two	Yeah but there arent anymore at all	sd	4
Minus two pencils how many have you got	No more	sd	4
So	It does minus seven X	sd	4
Equals	Twentyone	sd	4
Youre not going to add this 21 on the same side	After well we do divided by seven X	sd	4
No not seven X we want to keep the X	Times  a seventh	sd	4
Times minus to take away this minus then a seventh to take away this seven	Ha yeah	b	1
Okay	Hmm	sd	1
So here were going to be able well rub out already  with the eraser	Why is it minus two X at the top	sd	3
These two X there thats the one we want to take away	Why isnt it the minus seven X	sd	3
As we see that theres only Xs already here we will try and put everything this side we choose a side where we want to put the Xs	Hmm	sd	1
We can put it the other way round if you wish	But after that this thing we must also do it at 21	sd	4
I said everything we do behind this vertical bar here we must do it on both sides	Why does it stay  why	sd	3
So it makes X but 21 divided by seven	Er three	sd	4
You can rub out what you had here	Ha therefore X becomes minus three	sd	4
Ha therefore X becomes minus three	And then that one	sd	1
You mustnt divide by four	But Sir	sd	1
Yes	the minus seven X there	sd	3
Well because I did minus two X	Minus five X or minus two X	sd	4
I must still go over there behind	The solution must be the solution which is the least it must be more	sd	4
Quarter you can put twentyone and a half	Yeah	b	1
Ha yeah Aurore	Er here  we do there we would put minus 21 that doesnt do anything above	sd	4
No it would be minus five X minus 21	minus three	sd	4
Well yeah	So it still does something	sd	1
No Why do you want minus 21	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Is this correct	sd	1
Is this correct	I had	sd	1
I had	I had	sd	1
No youve done times times a seventh minus a seventh so the 21 is affected by the times minus a seventh	Is it correct	sd	1
Is that correct	Yeah	b	1
How do I eliminate the Xs	Minus two X	sd	4
Whats bothering me now	The minus seven	sd	4
Therefore times minus one	A seventh	sd	4
Which gives us X equals	Minus three	sd	4
So how are we going to see that	Its not possible	sd	4
Valentine	Because it would need a place for example four X is equal to three X minus one	sd	5
Because it would need a place for example four X is equal to three X minus one	Otherwise we cant take away the Xs	sd	2
Otherwise we cant take away the Xs	We cant take away one	sd	2
Lets see where do we find so	Times four X	sd	4
Youre okay that this four X is bothering you	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We do minus four X	sd	4
So we do minus four X	So it does zero equals zero	sd	4
Is that possible	No	b	1
If we did it again graphically as we did it here	Its parallel	sd	4
Four X the force the the the equation which says G of R of R X goes on four X	It starts from zero	sd	4
Are we okay	Yeah	b	1
Therefore it means I go from where	Minus one	sd	4
I go from minus one on there and then each time I advance one I go up four	Well it would do a	sd	1
Well it would do a	It is parallel	sd	4
Therefore when do they meet each other these two parallel lines	Never	sd	4
Thats the function of the right side	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Yeah	The first I didnt understand why	sd	3
Well then how do we take away a fraction	Well we  another fraction	sd	1
If you had only five X what would you do	Well er times a fifth	sd	4
We are obliged	Sir	sd	1
Hum um we do	Is it correct	sd	1
Ive got 949	Sir	sd	1
Yes	Come and see	sd	1
Of course	minus er minus the X either negative or positive	sd	4
Whats bothering you	Well there its to leave it like that	sd	4
Here youve got six X here youve got five X youve got X	Yeah	b	1
So you stay on the left and then you take away	Ah yeah so I do minus one	sd	4
Ah yeah so I do minus one	Well it does  and then after to do divide by er	sd	4
Therefore now	We do plus 10	sd	4
Is that okay	Thats fine	ba	1
Thats fine	Thats fine	ba	1
Do you all know about World Series	Mhmm	aa	1
Mhmm	Yeah	b	1
Did you know that Romina because I didnt know that	No yeah I know that	aa	1
But you know we want you to be able to talk to each other in any way you want	Couldnt we do like a you know how we do like	sd	1
Would it be better if I left you alone	Thats what Im saying	sd	1
Okay Im going to leave you alone	hey can go all seven or they could go all four	sd	4
hey can go all seven or they could go all four	So it would be A A A A and B 8 8 8 Team A and Team B	sd	4
So it would be A A A A and B 8 8 8 Team A and Team B	Wait whats the   wait wait	sd	1
Wait whats the   wait wait	So those are the only possibilities for four	sd	2
So those are the only possibilities for four	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	So in  four games would it be like onehalf of a chance	sd	2
So in  four games would it be like onehalf of a chance	Or would we have to write it out with  using aU seven	sd	2
Or would we have to write it out with  using aU seven	See I think that its the hardest to win it in four games	sv	2
See I think that its the hardest to win it in four games	Four games	sd	2
Four games	Definitely the hardest	sd	2
Definitely the hardest	Yeah exactly	b	2
Yeah exactly	So it wouldnt be onehalf	sd	2
So it wouldnt be onehalf	Isnt it the odds   the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game	sd	2
Isnt it the odds   the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game	Thats what Im thinking	sd	2
Thats what Im thinking	Look its a fifty percent chance of winning the first game	sd	2
Look its a fifty percent chance of winning the first game	Alright	b	1
Alright	Onehalf	aa	2
Onehalf	So its like half times a half   no wait   remember the odds get harder to win two in a row like a coin flip	sd	2
So its like half times a half   no wait   remember the odds get harder to win two in a row like a coin flip	Yeah so thats	aa	2
Yeah so thats	Yeah thats how you do it  a half times a half times a half times a half	sd	5
Yeah thats how you do it  a half times a half times a half times a half	Alright	b	1
Alright	If thats the case what is  it	sd	3
If thats the case what is  it	Four hold on   four times	sd	2
Four hold on   four times	Thats sixteen	sd	2
Thats sixteen	Is it one thirtytwo	sd	2
Is it one thirtytwo	Two times two is four times two is eight	sd	2
Two times two is four times two is eight	Three times three	sd	2
Three times three	Oh never mind I get it	sd	1
Oh never mind I get it	Now would you have for five games like would it be like that	sd	2
Now would you have for five games like would it be like that	Hopefully the odds of winning are	sd	2
Hopefully the odds of winning are	Were never going to get   its never gonna equal up to one though	sd	2
Were never going to get   its never gonna equal up to one though	Does it have to	sd	2
Does it have to	No but I was thinking you know how we do like uh like A	sd	2
No but I was thinking you know how we do like uh like A	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	For four   you know what Im saying	sd	2
For four   you know what Im saying	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	And it would be like a A B A A you know sort of stuff like that	sd	2
And it would be like a A B A A you know sort of stuff like that	What does that have to do	sd	3
What does that have to do	Find out the odds of not winning	sd	2
Find out the odds of not winning	Thats like six	sd	2
Thats like six	To get the probability	sd	2
To get the probability	wouldnt you have easier odds of winning in six games than in four	sd	2
wouldnt you have easier odds of winning in six games than in four	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Doesnt it get less though	sd	2
Doesnt it get less though	Thats why its wrong	sd	5
Thats why its wrong	Okay	b	1
Okay	Theres probably a different way to do it  than saying just multiplying	sd	2

Its like	Mike why dont you move like just move in a little	sd	1
Mike why dont you move like just move in a little	Okay thats good enough	ba	1
Okay thats good enough	Two inches	sd	1
Two inches	Theres gotta be a different way of urn of looking at it then cause if you just say multiply the probability in four games and seven games itd be	sd	5

ts gonna be too   its too small	Its gonna be harder in seven but actually its really not	sd	2
Its gonna be harder in seven but actually its really not	Cause youve got more chances	sd	5
Cause youve got more chances	Yeah cause you could win one lose one	sd	5
Yeah cause you could win one lose one	So	b	1
So	You could win three and lose three	sd	2
You could win three and lose three	The sevensided thing or something	sd	2
The sevensided thing or something	Or you could think of it like	sv	1
Or you could think of it like	Yeah if you list them like	sd	2
Yeah if you list them like	That would be like seven different things	sd	2
That would be like seven different things	This one is two	sd	2
This one is two	Like a a sevensided	sd	2
Like a a sevensided	I would say like a win and a loss like that	sd	2
I would say like a win and a loss like that	Then you go like this	sd	2
Then you go like this	You have with the four games you have a maximum of four and you have to win four so its like you have to be a  hundred percent a winner	sd	5
You have with the four games you have a maximum of four and you have to win four so its like you have to be a  hundred percent a winner	And with seven games you have seven possible a you have to do is win in four	sd	5
And with seven games you have seven possible a you have to do is win in four	So you got a four out of seven chance of	sd	5
So you got a four out of seven chance of	But then so then	sd	1

Are you prepared to argue that  position	Because	sd	1
Ok  Meredith go ahead	You asked me where to place one	sd	1
You asked me where to place one	I think if you have thirds one third two  thirds three thirds three thirds would be equal to one	sd	5
I think if you have thirds one third two  thirds three thirds three thirds would be equal to one	See because one third  two thirds  and three thirds    three thirds is the same as saying one	sd	5
See because one third  two thirds  and three thirds    three thirds is the same as saying one	Four fourths is the same as saying one	sd	5
Four fourths is the same as saying one	A hundred hundredths is the same thing as saying one	sd	5
Michael	I think that if you have a number with the same number on top as in the bottom  then it is always going to be equal to the number named one	sd	5
Jessica you are making a face are you confused	I think yeah I agree with her	sd	2
Alan do you have a comment	No what I was saying before when I was talking is that zero to the  one third  mark is one third	sd	5
No what I was saying before when I was talking is that zero to the  one third  mark is one third	zero to the two thirds mark is two thirds	sd	5
zero to the two thirds mark is two thirds	Zero to the three  thirds mark is three thirds	sd	5
Zero to the three  thirds mark is three thirds	Now three thirds you cannot have any more thirds or  you would have four thirds	sd	5
Now three thirds you cannot have any more thirds or  you would have four thirds	Then you have to make the thirds bigger or not have  another	sd	5
Then you have to make the thirds bigger or not have  another	You can only have three thirds	sd	5
Let us hold that question about what would happen if we had  four thirds	You only have four thirds if you are going to have that you could only have four  fourths not four thirds you can have four thirds	sd	5
I wonder if we could have four  thirds if we went further	Then we would have to have six thirds	sd	4
Meredith just said I  want to make sure you are all able to hear what she just said I believe she said  that you cannot have four thirds in this interval but I asked the question   if you  extend the interval could have four thirds	If you made it to two you would have six thirds and then you could place four  thirds	sd	5
Bryan what did you have to say	Alan thinks that I am placing four thirds and I am not	sd	2
Alan thinks that I am placing four thirds and I am not	Because you see I think  that you would start on the negative side	sv	5
Because you see I think  that you would start on the negative side	Like umm     For example you would probably start on the one third and right  between the one third   and the two thirds would be one third right   between the two thirds and the three thirds   would be two thirds and you see he thinks that when I add that there he thinks  that zero to one third is a fraction it is not	sd	5
Like umm     For example you would probably start on the one third and right  between the one third   and the two thirds would be one third right   between the two thirds and the three thirds   would be two thirds and you see he thinks that when I add that there he thinks  that zero to one third is a fraction it is not	Because zero is a separate number  and it is not a fraction and so I would think that if you start on the one third and  anything pass that if you keep going up you would hit two thirds and anything  between there would be one third	sd	5
Because zero is a separate number  and it is not a fraction and so I would think that if you start on the one third and  anything pass that if you keep going up you would hit two thirds and anything  between there would be one third	But if you start at zero and you go across and  you hit the one third zero is not a fraction so if you add one more zero between  one third is not a fraction so it would be four thirds	sd	5
Some people have written zero as zero thirds	Okay	b	1
Okay	What I was saying before is this	sd	1
Very interesting what Meredith is doing up there	Okay	b	1
Okay	What I am saying is that zero to the one third mark anything from zero to  one third is the one third	sd	4
What I am saying is that zero to the one third mark anything from zero to  one third is the one third	Now anything pass the one third mark we would be  calling one third zero	sd	4
Now anything pass the one third mark we would be  calling one third zero	See one third is higher than zero	sd	4
See one third is higher than zero	Right	b	2
Right	So you would not count zero to one third as one third	sd	5
You want to say something else Alan	What I am saying is	sd	1
What I am saying is	Here is a model of using thirds	sd	4
Here is a model of using thirds	Suppose that end is zero and that end is one	sd	4
Suppose that end is zero and that end is one	You are saying from there to there this piece really has no fraction value in  the one third	sd	2
You are saying from there to there this piece really has no fraction value in  the one third	There is no fraction value	sd	2
There is no fraction value	You cannot put that over there look is has extra room	sd	5
You cannot put that over there look is has extra room	You only have three  spaces one two three you have one third from zero to one third two thirds  from one third to two thirds and three thirds area from two thirds to three thirds	sd	5
Meredith what is your  comment	Well I put one third two thirds and then three thirds would equal one	sd	5
Well I put one third two thirds and then three thirds would equal one	And  then I went from zero to two it would be one and one third  two and   two thirds  and then one and three thirds	sd	5
One and two thirds right	There is no fraction value between zero and one third because	sd	4
There is no fraction value between zero and one third because	If you have no value between zero and one third then look you   eliminate that how many spaces would you have	sd	2
If you have no value between zero and one third then look you   eliminate that how many spaces would you have	What I would think would be that if you start on the lower number  and then keep going up and until you hit that	sd	5
What I would think would be that if you start on the lower number  and then keep going up and until you hit that	Anything between there would be the one third and the two thirds right   there	sd	5
Anything between there would be the one third and the two thirds right   there	And if you keep going up to there you will hit that and   that will be two thirds   and if you put a bar right there it would count as one   two thirds between 1 would be three thirds	sd	5
And if you keep going up to there you will hit that and   that will be two thirds   and if you put a bar right there it would count as one   two thirds between 1 would be three thirds	Because like I was saying if you started there at zero    then zero does not have value	sd	5
I wanted to give Sarah and Beth  and Audra a chance to share their idea and if everyone listen a bit more we  will  see what we are thinking in a few minutes	We thought that we did not have to put anything else on the number line because  if we put this from zero to 1 and you would mark one third here because if you  used a ruler here to measure it or something  one third would go here  two thirds would go here  three thirds would go herebecause the length will be the same as Cuisenaire rods  or something	sd	5
Where would you place the threethirds	We would place it here	sd	4
How many of you believe it should go right on top of the one	Thats what we meant	sd	1
Thats what we meant	We just could not get it right on top to fit	sd	4
You meant to put it on top	You just put it under it	sd	4
J	I want to think about it a little more	sd	1
James	I think one half and one half makes a whole and four fourths would make a  whole and three thirds would make a whole also so it will be right on top of the  one	sd	5
Are you agreeing with that Jakki	Yes	b	2
So I am hearing some agreement  on that and that is where you would place it	Zack has three chickens if grandpa sells three chickens he  will have as many as Zack	sd	1

How many chickens does  Grandpa have	Now our first answer was six but then again  we thought it was three	sd	4
Why did you first have six	Thats interesting	sv	1
Thats interesting	Well because if you grandpa had um well his dad had three   and if grandpa sells three we figure he will have the same  amount as dad so you know hed have six altogether	sd	5
That sounds very nice very good to me Stephanie	Well weve got our three its just that grandpa will have the  same as many grandpa will have the same amount of  chickens as dad and that totals out to three	sd	5
Stephanie can you explain to me the two words that you  said was so important at first it was as instead of and	What	ba	3
And I really wanted to know what you meant	Okay well what I meant was then I looked at the last one  and I saw that there was no ed	sd	5
Okay well what I meant was then I looked at the last one  and I saw that there was no ed	If it was had then I would  figure out it was six but if it was has have and so thats  what I thought it was three	sd	5
If it was had then I would  figure out it was six but if it was has have and so thats  what I thought it was three	Thats how it was three	sd	5
What do you think the answer is Stephanie	I think its six	sv	4
You think its six if he starts with  six and he sells three then he will have as many as dad	Three	sd	4
Do you agree with Aaron hes  saying he thinks its six	It might be three	sd	2
What do you think if grandpa has three and he then sells  three does he have as many as dad	No	b	1
What would he have if he had three and then he sells three	none	aa	4
None or zero so would he have as many as dad	No	b	1
And then would he have the same number as dad	Yes	b	1
If grandpa has six and he sells three  then	I know what hes saying he would have three more like dad	sd	2

What did you find	Well we started by writing out the possibilities  didnt we	sd	4

Could you walk me through that very slowly	We finished	sd	1
We finished	I wish we had the stuff we had	sd	1
Could you show me what it looks like and how you thought about it	We just um	sd	1
We just um	Well the fiTeachert one was kind of  we knew that someone   you know there s two two people	sd	4
Well the fiTeachert one was kind of  we knew that someone   you know there s two two people	In order to win in four games then one team had to win either all four games or the other team had to win all four games	sd	2
In order to win in four games then one team had to win either all four games or the other team had to win all four games	So out of all the possibilities	sd	2
What exactly  what exactly did you find there	That it was   the chance of that happening was oneeighth	sd	4
And could you explain how you got that	One half one half one half one half	sd	4
One half one half one half one half	Because	sd	1
Because	Equals onesixteenth	sd	2
Equals onesixteenth	And there are two possibilities of	sd	2
And there are two possibilities of	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	We did that	sd	2
We did that	And theres four games	sd	2
Whats the half	The half is  okay the probability that if they played one game and you have two teams and they are equally whatever	sd	4
The half is  okay the probability that if they played one game and you have two teams and they are equally whatever	Equally as good	sd	2
Equally as good	The probability that one team would win	sd	2
The probability that one team would win	You could win or lose	sd	2
Okay	So youre	sd	1
So youre making an assumption that the teams are equally matched	Yeah	b	1
That it s just as likely for one team to win as the other	Yeah	b	1
So that s the way you are framing your problem	Exactly	aa	1
Okay	So then the fiTeachert game you have one half chance	sd	4
So then the fiTeachert game you have one half chance	Its either the home team say or the away team   either H or A	sd	2
Okay	So that would  you know you have either one or the other is going to win	sd	5
So that would  you know you have either one or the other is going to win	And the same thing for each of them	sd	5
And the same thing for each of them	And then was it half times half times half times half	sd	5
And then was it half times half times half times half	And you get onesixteenth	sd	2
And you get onesixteenth	Thats why it s   that s for one team winning	sd	2
Thats why it s   that s for one team winning	Thats for one team winning	sd	2
Thats for one team winning	And then for two teams winning  its twosixteenths or oneeighth	sd	2
Could I ask a simpleminded question	mhmm	aa	1
Why did you multiply	We did this in math	sd	1
We did this in math	Because	sd	1
Im sorry but I really want to know	Because adding  it wouldnt work	sd	5
Because adding  it wouldnt work	Because youd have a half plus a half  youd get two	sd	5
Because youd have a half plus a half  youd get two	And what would that prove	sd	5
So youve eliminated adding	Eliminated adding	sd	4
Eliminated adding	But	sd	1
Why did you multiply	And if youre not going to add then you re not going to subtract	sd	5
And if youre not going to add then you re not going to subtract	Because you have either  for this one you have either a home or an away	sd	5
Because you have either  for this one you have either a home or an away	And for the next one you can either have another home or an away	sd	5
And for the next one you can either have another home or an away	So for the home you add  Oh	sd	5
So for the home you add  Oh	The home team wins or the away team wins or the home team wins and the home team wins or the away team wins and the home team wins or the away and the away	sd	5
The home team wins or the away team wins or the home team wins and the home team wins or the away team wins and the home team wins or the away and the away	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	Thats what it is	sd	2
Thats what it is	So for the fiTeachert one its either	sd	2
So for the fiTeachert one its either	You follow that	sd	2
You follow that	You know about that thing dont you	sd	2
You know about that thing dont you	How many games  two	sd	2

Yeah	This is the probability	sd	4
So what does the table represent	The two times the two	sd	4
The two times the two	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	We actually have to multiply	sd	2
We actually have to multiply	The half times the half	sd	2
The half times the half	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	This is	sd	1
So here you re looking  are you looking at it in your  are you imagining a two game series at this point	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	This is just a two game series	sd	1
This is just a two game series	And then if you had another one wed have	sd	4
And then if you had another one wed have	For each of them youd add a home or away	sd	2
For each of them youd add a home or away	Yeah	b	2
But this explains how from  the two possibilities	Thats why were multiplying	sd	5
Thats why were multiplying	That is why were multiplying	sd	5
For each of the two games you re multiplying because of that	And then for every one we kind of were consistent and then we d multiply again	sd	4
So when you multiply four two s together you get sixteen	mhmm	aa	1
mhmm	mhmm	aa	2
And what does sixteen represent	The total possibilities of	sd	4
The total possibilities of	Yeah of	b	2
Yeah of	Of anything	sd	2
Of anything	Anything in the four game series	sd	2
Anything in the four game series	No the total possibilities of	sd	2
No the total possibilities of	Anything	sd	2
Anything	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	In a four game series	sd	2
In a four game series then there are sixteen possible ways	That something could happen	sd	4
That something could happen	Out of those there are only two ways that	sd	2
Out of those there are only two ways that	If there are two teams	sd	2
If there are two teams	And then out of those there are only two ways where someone is going to win in four games	sd	2
And then out of those there are only two ways where someone is going to win in four games	To the n	sd	2
To the n	And that would be   yeah exactly	aa	2
And that would be   yeah exactly	Two to the n	sd	2
So it would be two out of sixteen	mhmm	aa	1
mhmm	mhmm	aa	2
And thats how you got oneeighth	Yes	b	4
So thats  so what do you  so the probability of one team or the other winning after just four games you found was an eighth	Yes	b	1
Okay   So what came next	So next you have to add another slot right	sd	4
So next you have to add another slot right	mhmm	aa	2
mhmm	And then it could be all sixteen possibilities with another A or another H on it but subtracting the two where someone already won right	sd	5
And then it could be all sixteen possibilities with another A or another H on it but subtracting the two where someone already won right	Is that right	aa	2
Is that right	That would be that would be in four games	sd	2
That would be that would be in four games	So you have  you know what its going to be in four games	sv	5
So you have  you know what its going to be in four games	You want H s only in four games because its out of sixteen	sd	5
You want H s only in four games because its out of sixteen	And then out of all those sixteen possibilities that you had then all sixteen then can go to an A   like the next slot can be an A winning or the next one can be an H right	sd	5
And then out of all those sixteen possibilities that you had then all sixteen then can go to an A   like the next slot can be an A winning or the next one can be an H right	Hmmmm	aa	2
Hmmmm	So thats thirtytwo	ba	2
So thats thirtytwo	So that makes thirtytwo	sd	2
So that makes thirtytwo	Something over thirtytwo	sd	2
Something over thirtytwo	Sixteen plus sixteen	sd	2
Could you go through that a little more slowly	Alright	b	1
Im hearing two things that are interesting to me and Id like to know more about them	Were saying that	sd	1
Okay	That	aa	1
Let me say what the two things are  Im trying to get a clear question	Hmmmm	aa	1
One is that  uh  with an additional game it looks like there s an additional multiplication	Hmmmm	aa	1
Is that right	mhmm	aa	1
The second thing is that you re taking into account in some way that as we go into a fifth game that the series hasnt been won already	Yes	b	1
I think you said something several of you said something like that	Thats why	ba	1
One is	All right  All right well	sd	1
All right  All right well	You re adding another one like he did so you re adding   you re multiplying onesixteenth	sd	5
You re adding another one like he did so you re adding   you re multiplying onesixteenth	You re multiplying the onesixteenth  by another half	sd	5
You re multiplying the onesixteenth  by another half	Half	sd	2
Half	So you get one thirtytwo	sd	2
So you get one thirtytwo	But from that you have to eliminate the possibility that   um  its won in four games	sd	2
But from that you have to eliminate the possibility that   um  its won in four games	Oneeighth	sd	2
Oneeighth	What	ba	1
What	Oneeighth right	aa	2
But is  does that complete the solution for this case	No	sd	1
No	Then you got to  from there you got to count out how many of those someone actually wins it	sd	4
Then you got to  from there you got to count out how many of those someone actually wins it	You have to find the ones	sd	2
You have to find the ones	So you got like your  you have sixteen total games right that you had before	sv	5
So you got like your  you have sixteen total games right that you had before	And then you have  out of those sixteen like with the four with the four  excuse me  from the fiTeachert game	sd	5
And then you have  out of those sixteen like with the four with the four  excuse me  from the fiTeachert game	When you add the next thing on that s going to be the A or the H	sd	5
When you add the next thing on that s going to be the A or the H	So there s going to be sixteen   the original sixteen with an A on the end and then the other original sixteen with an H on the end  where the away team wins one of the games	sd	5
So there s going to be sixteen   the original sixteen with an A on the end and then the other original sixteen with an H on the end  where the away team wins one of the games	The home team wins the other sixteen of the games	sd	5
There s something Im wondering about though Um  if they didnt win it in four games and	And they had	sd	1
And they had	They had to win it	sd	4
They had to win it	If they go to the fifth game	sd	2
How do you deal with that	We looked at it like we counted up all the possibilities of all the games	sd	4
We looked at it like we counted up all the possibilities of all the games	And you would have to have at least one team win four of those games	sd	2
And you would have to have at least one team win four of those games	Yeah right	b	2
Yeah right	And make sure it ends in five games	sd	2
And make sure it ends in five games	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And then you count up all the	sd	2
Oh I see	Count up all the chances  that was the next step	sd	5
Count up all the chances  that was the next step	Then from here  from the thirtytwo that we had  then we counted up all the games where some where there was four As and four Hs  added them together	sd	5
Then from here  from the thirtytwo that we had  then we counted up all the games where some where there was four As and four Hs  added them together	The four As and four Hs	sd	5
The four As and four Hs	Not having like four four in a row and then losing	sd	2
Not having like four four in a row and then losing	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Because then that would be a four game series	sd	5
Because then that would be a four game series	Subtract two from the fiTeachert one	sd	5
Subtract two from the fiTeachert one	So that s the total number won over thirtytwo and thats how we got the probability for the fifth game	sd	5
On the one hand it gets won by the away team	Mhmm	aa	1
So   so  it looks like  uh  the part we dont see yet because we havent explained it yet is what do the games what are the possibilities of the fiTeachert four games when the fifth game is a win for away or similarly what are the possibilities for the fiTeachert four games when the	Three	sd	4
When	Three wins	sd	4
When the home team wins	Three wins	sd	4
How do you see those	It s with the triangle right	sd	4
How do you count it	I saw it differently	sd	4
Are you saying that there are a couple of different ways of seeing it	Yeah there s a different way of approaching that problem	sd	4
Could we walk through all of them	I guess so	sd	1
One at a time	Very simple	sd	1
Very simple	One was writing them writing them out	sd	4
One was writing them writing them out	Yeah you just write them out   just   yeah	sd	2
Yeah you just write them out   just   yeah	I want to explain something	sd	1
I want to explain something	There s the away team	sd	4
There s the away team	Youre familiar with Pascals Triangle right	sd	2
Youre familiar with Pascals Triangle right	Right	b	2
Right	You know those	sd	2
Yeah	I had  theres a way to um connect that and binary numbeTeacher together	sd	4
Yes	You are familiar with that	sd	1
Mhmm	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I used that to find a solution to that problem	sd	4
So I used that to find a solution to that problem	Right	b	1
Right	Let me just	sd	1
How does it go	all right	b	1
all right	Well the connection would be like  this is a two number like the binary with two numbeTeacher in two places	sd	4
Yes	The fiTeachert one is the amount the total number to only have  no ones in it	sd	5
The fiTeachert one is the amount the total number to only have  no ones in it	The second one would be with one	sd	5
The second one would be with one	And the third place would be the amount that had two right	sd	5
So you re looking at the row 1  2  1	Well Im just going to give you an example   you undeTeachertand	sd	1
Yes	This column has just one with whole zeros in it	sd	4
Mhmm	This one has  theres two in that those four combinations that have	sd	4
What are the two	This one and that one	sd	4
Mhmm	And the last one all ones	sd	4
Mhmm	And this holds true for the next one	sd	4
And this holds true for the next one	This one has there s only one with all zeros	sd	4
Yes	Theres three with uh  with one	sd	4
Theres three with uh  with one	And theres	sd	2
Why are there three with one	Cause theres three places	sd	5
Cause theres three places	Theres only  theres only three ways to do it	sd	5
Theres only  theres only three ways to do it	And it s like that	sd	5
Okay	The next one would be three three with two ones	sd	4
Mhmm	And the last one would be one with all three	sd	4
Just  three	Well I was	sd	1
Well I was	It s the same situation as the one except you re switching you re switching   the zero would be in the ones spot	sd	4
It s the same situation as the one except you re switching you re switching   the zero would be in the ones spot	I kind of wrote an explanation about this	sd	1
Oh you mean if it had two ones it	Its the same as having two zeros in that situation	sd	4
Its the same as having two zeros in that situation	Cause youre having two of one number and one of the other	sd	5
Cause youre having two of one number and one of the other	Um	b	1
I see	Use the board	sd	1
There was an eraser down there and chalk by the the tray Um	Ill explain to you real quick why you add  em together which is kind of saying why is there three	sd	4
Ill explain to you real quick why you add  em together which is kind of saying why is there three	And its the same probability	sd	4
Okay	I wrote that up and I gave it to Dr Maher  if shes here  and I dont know what she did with it	sd	1
I wrote that up and I gave it to Dr Maher  if shes here  and I dont know what she did with it	Shes probably probably reading it	sd	1
Shes probably probably reading it	All right	b	1
All right	Um  in the in the previous in this category or whatever you have two numbeTeacher	sd	4
Um  in the in the previous in this category or whatever you have two numbeTeacher	One of them has noth  nothing in it	sd	4
One of them has noth  nothing in it	One of them has nothing in it like no ones in it	sd	4
Um Hm	The second one has  theres two with just one	sd	4
The second one has  theres two with just one	The last one theres all spaces are filled up or whatever	sd	4
Okay	Then when you add another place to it	sd	4
Yes	Each combination in there could turn into two different ones you undeTeachertand	sd	4
Each combination in there could turn into two different ones you undeTeachertand	One will have another  one will have a zero or one at the end of it	sd	4
I want to be just certain that I undeTeachertand exactly what youre seeing here	Take this fiTeachert number which is zero	sd	4
Take this fiTeachert number which is zero	Uh the second	sd	4
Yeah	Is one	sd	4
Is one	This would be two	sd	4
This would be two	And this is three	sd	4
Mhmm	It s binary numbeTeacher	aa	4
It s binary numbeTeacher	When you add another place to it now you have three spots to fill up  the these two this 00 still stays could become the same value	sd	5
When you add another place to it now you have three spots to fill up  the these two this 00 still stays could become the same value	And this one could become one	sd	5
And this one could become one	So now two are formed from every single com  possibility	sd	5
Mhmm	Right	b	1
Right	You undeTeachertand	sd	1
I do	That was like adding the extra slot	sd	4
That was like adding the extra slot	Thats the extra slot with the two possibilities	sd	2
Thats the extra slot with the two possibilities	Now when you when you add an extra slot obviously one of them is still going to have one and one of them is going to have two	sd	5
Now when you when you add an extra slot obviously one of them is still going to have one and one of them is going to have two	So the 2 right here theres going to be two  one for each  that that still have one	sd	5
Mhmm	Thats why you add it to that	sd	5
Thats why you add it to that	And this one will have a  this one will add get one added   so thats one	sd	5
And this one will have a  this one will add get one added   so thats one	So theres your three	sd	5
So theres your three	They come together like that	sd	5
They come together like that	This one there will be the other two of the   and now in terms of four combinations the other two will have uh two	sd	5
This one there will be the other two of the   and now in terms of four combinations the other two will have uh two	And the ones that dont get it will have one	sd	5
And the ones that dont get it will have one	You know what Im talking about	sd	1
You know what Im talking about	Um so they all  thats why they add together	sd	5
Um so they all  thats why they add together	Um and then that would explain why theres a three there why theres a four	sd	5
Um and then that would explain why theres a three there why theres a four	Because these three are ones that have an  a 1 added on	sd	5
Mhmm	And they go into this category the ones that dont get anything added go into that one	sd	4
Are you saying for example that  that six comes up by adding	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Like you add theres theres now theres with these three there with these two these six possibilities theres twelve of them	sd	5
Uh huh	Six of them get a one added on to them	sd	4
Right	That way that would give you  bring it to three	sd	5
That way that would give you  bring it to three	Three ones in the in the series whatever and these three uh half of them dont get dont get a 1added onto them	sd	5
Three ones in the in the series whatever and these three uh half of them dont get dont get a 1added onto them	That would that would leave them in the same category like with just three	sd	5
Uh huh	Thats why you add would add them	sd	5
Uh huh	You undeTeachertand that	sd	1
And the whole triangle is built that way	Yeah by adding	aa	4
Okay	Now when they had their their possibilities	sd	1
Mhmm	I saw that like the fiTeachert possibility for the for one game or for winning in four games was two out of eight	sd	4
I saw that like the fiTeachert possibility for the for one game or for winning in four games was two out of eight	And the next one was uh	sd	1
And the next one was uh	We had two out of sixteen then one out of eight	sd	2
We had two out of sixteen then one out of eight	It was two out of sixteen Mike	sd	2
It was two out of sixteen Mike	It was two out of sixteen	sd	2
It was two out of sixteen	Yeah one out of eight	sd	2
Yeah one out of eight	Then it was uh eight out of thirtytwo the next one	sd	2
Then it was uh eight out of thirtytwo the next one	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Then eight out of thirtytwo	sd	5
Then eight out of thirtytwo	And the last one was twenty out of whatever something	sd	5
And the last one was twenty out of whatever something	It was out of something	sd	5
It was out of something	It was out of sixtyfour	sd	2
How did you find those	Well they they found it out by actually writing out every single one	sd	5
Well they they found it out by actually writing out every single one	But then I I I was thinking  right theres a 1 a 4 and a 10 here and if you I guess double them you come out with these numbeTeacher a 2 an 8 and a 20 one doubled is two	sd	5
But then I I I was thinking  right theres a 1 a 4 and a 10 here and if you I guess double them you come out with these numbeTeacher a 2 an 8 and a 20 one doubled is two	Because nothing there had a	sd	5
Because nothing there had a	You know what Im talking about	sd	1
You know what Im talking about	Because	sd	1
Yes	Theres 4 doubled is an 8	sd	5
Mhmm	Ten doubled is a twenty	sd	5
Yes	Mike why cant you start from  another one	sd	3
Why  what do you go by	Cause thats from four	sd	5
Yes	Cause this is the the fourth place over	sd	5
Cause this is the the fourth place over	Now um these are the how many games are won with three	sd	5
Now um these are the how many games are won with three	All right	aa	1
All right	How many  Im not saying As and Hs	sd	4
How many  Im not saying As and Hs	Im using ones and zeros	sd	4
Yeah that I  Okay so your ones and zeros are representing home and away	As and Hs Now these have  how many came out with all wins  all ones right	sd	4
As and Hs Now these have  how many came out with all wins  all ones right	Out of three games	sd	4
How does that fit into your picture	You know like	sd	1
Then the away team wins one	Out of five games	sd	4
Out of five games	No erase the zero	sd	2
Lets make it a four game series	Okay	b	1
And how does that connect to the Pascal triangle that you drew	Um	b	1
So lets put another 1 lets put another 1on the end	All right	aa	1
So they win the last game yeah	This combination would be to this  There should be out of part of these out of these ten	sd	4
It would be one of those ten	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Um youve got uh am I right	sd	1
Um youve got uh am I right	Yeah I think you are	sv	2
Yeah	I had it	sd	1
I had it	Um  I dont know	sd	3
Um  I dont know	It would be one of the four	sd	2
It would be one of the four	One of the four	sd	2
One of the four	Cause the zero can go in	sd	5
Cause the zero can go in	Yeah All right	b	2
Yeah All right	Actually no	sd	4
Wait	No	b	1
No	It would be one of the five	sd	4
It would be one of the five	Cause it	sd	1
Cause it	All right	b	1
All right	Well I think it would be one of the four because  Lets just take this one	sv	2
Well I think it would be one of the four because  Lets just take this one	All right  so  this is one of the one of the four	sd	2
All right  so  this is one of the one of the four	And the next one would be one of the five	sd	2
And the next one would be one of the five	For some reason I dont know why but like the amount of possibilities that uh a three uh that three ones will come up	sd	2
Mhmm	In with uh four places or something	sd	4
Mhmm	But uh that thats the probability of winning on the fifth game	sd	4
But uh that thats the probability of winning on the fifth game	I dont know why but if you if you win three games for four thats the probability of winning in the fourth	sd	5
Are you saying that if the if the home team won three out of the exactly three out of the four then its in a position to win  if it wins the fifth game or	Its not in a position to win but if that the probability of winning three out of four	sd	4
Uh huh	Is the probability of winning in in the in the fifth game	sd	4
Is the probability of winning in in the in the fifth game	Of winning four out of five	sd	2
Of winning four out of five	As not not yeah of winning having four of winning in the fifth game  I I wouldnt say four out of five	sd	2
As not not yeah of winning having four of winning in the fifth game  I I wouldnt say four out of five	Yeah but if you won in the fifth game youd be winning four games of five	sd	5
Yeah but if you won in the fifth game youd be winning four games of five	Thats just a way to express how thats one of four ways to express how the home team won three out of the four games	sd	2
Well suppose were the home team and that weve won three out of the fiTeachert four games what do we think about the fifth game	The fifth game	sd	1
Yeah	UM	b	1
UM	I just think we should refer to it as the home team because it switches back and forth so the home team could win four games in a row and you know it could actually be split two and two or something like that you know	sd	5
I just think we should refer to it as the home team because it switches back and forth so the home team could win four games in a row and you know it could actually be split two and two or something like that you know	Its been bothering me	sd	1
Its been bothering me	Cause that it brings a whole other problem in	sd	4
Cause that it brings a whole other problem in	Well just pretend all the games were played on one field	sd	2
Well just pretend all the games were played on one field	That way theres only one home	sd	2
That way theres only one home	Well Im just saying that	sd	1
Well Im just saying that	Thats a whole other problem	sd	2
Thats a whole other problem	Team one team two	sd	2
Team one team two	All right	aa	1
All right	Instead of H and A	sd	2
Okay	Now what was the question	sd	3
So we won three games out of four	Right	b	1
What does it mean	What we think  Um	sd	1
So what might we be thinking	Well the probability of winning tomorrow or the next game is a half	sd	4
Ah ha	But the probability of the probability of you actually coming up you know winning on the fifth game is eight out of thirtytwo	sd	4
Okay why eight	Well theres theres a probability of four out of  sixteen right	sd	4
Well theres theres a probability of four out of  sixteen right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Four out of sixteen of winning fiTeachert three three games out of four	sd	2
I see	So the probability of winning those three games are four out of sixteen	sd	4
So the probability of winning those three games are four out of sixteen	Youre doing both of them	sd	2
Youre doing both of them	Yeah  um  we were just talking about the away team	sd	2
Yeah  um  we were just talking about the away team	All right I got it now	sd	1
All right I got it now	The probability of you winning would be four out of sixteen	sd	5
The probability of you winning would be four out of sixteen	Then to win the next game would be thats the probability of winning the next game	sd	5
Then to win the next game would be thats the probability of winning the next game	Four out of thirtytwo	sd	5
Four out of thirtytwo	Obviously theres two teams	sd	5
Obviously theres two teams	So you double it here	sv	5
So you double it here	You add another four out of thirtytwo	sd	5
It does make sense I think	Cause I mean I think I was	sd	1
Does that make sense to you	Well that was  seriously that was kind of yeah that was kind of the same thing that we were doing	sd	2
Well that was  seriously that was kind of yeah that was kind of the same thing that we were doing	We were just using As and Hs	sd	5
We were just using As and Hs	And then wed multiply them in the next part or like the by putting in the next slot	sd	5
And then wed multiply them in the next part or like the by putting in the next slot	Thats how we got the bottom number	sd	2
Thats how we got the bottom number	And thats how wed get the bottom number	sd	2
And thats how wed get the bottom number	Yeah those are all our ideas together	sd	2
Yeah those are all our ideas together	And A and Hs would be like thats a nice representation of all of our ideas	sd	2
The probability of getting where we are	And the probability of winning in the next game	sd	4
Are you all how did you look at it	I looked at it as	sd	1
I looked at it as	I I really wasnt too sure	sd	1
I I really wasnt too sure	Its all those numbeTeacher in the triangle	sd	4
Its all those numbeTeacher in the triangle	It had some kind of relationship and after you said that now it makes sense	sd	4
It had some kind of relationship and after you said that now it makes sense	Does it make sense to you	sd	1
Okay now  okay so Mikes approach was to make this binary coding to code into these two digit binary numbeTeacher and to connect to Pascals triangle uh what were the other approaches that you did for this to get the eight over thirtytwo	Well Michael does the binary and we do it but just with the H and the A	sd	2
Uh huh	Like in home and away	sd	4
Like in home and away	And he just makes it look a lot nicer than we do	sd	2
And he just makes it look a lot nicer than we do	We didnt tie it in with	sd	2
We didnt tie it in with	We found the thirtytwo by multiplying  we didnt write all those thirtytwo out	sd	2
We found the thirtytwo by multiplying  we didnt write all those thirtytwo out	Yeah like Brian did	sd	2
Okay	And then we wrote the eight out which which would satisfy that	sd	4
Could you show me how you wrote them	Thats how we did it like this	sd	4
Did you just pick them at random or did you have uh did you have a way of	For four	sd	1
For four	Well we have like an organized way like you bring the A through and	sd	4
Could you show me	I didnt write them like that	sd	4
Yeah	I did	sd	1
I did	Um are we doing it for four four games	sd	1
Um are we doing it for four four games	Five games or four games	sd	3
Five games or four games	What do you want the two or the eight	sd	3
Could somebody go to the board and do that	Knock youTeacherelf out	sd	1
Knock youTeacherelf out	How many games four or five	sd	3
How many games four or five	Well you start with four and then you could add another thing on the end to explain five better	sd	4
Well you start with four and then you could add another thing on the end to explain five better	All the possibilities or just for one team winning	sd	3
All the possibilities or just for one team winning	Just for just the eight right	sd	2
In other words	Thats for five though  I dont know for the fiTeachert one the only way in four games theyd win is home home home home or away away away away	sd	4
Mhmm	And thats where we got our two	sd	4
And what about five games	And five games	sd	1
And five games	Five games  four would have to be of one like letter	sd	4
Five games  four would have to be of one like letter	We picked something to go at the end like away	sd	2
We picked something to go at the end like away	And the other four would be the opposite	sd	2
And the other four would be the opposite	Yeah and that just	sd	2
So you didnt just pull them out of the air	No we didnt	sd	4
So now  thats how we looked at the probability thats how you looked at the probability of winning the series in exactly five games was that right and you got eight over thirtytwo	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mhmm	aa	2
Oneeighth	Hmhm	aa	1
And eight thirtyseconds whats that	You just did it over sixteen we did two sixteens and that was four sixteens	sd	2
Thats winning in six games	You add the  you add the other half	sd	4
You add the  you add the other half	Multiply the other half to get sixtyfour	sd	2
Multiply the other half to get sixtyfour	Multiply the other half and then	sd	2
Uh huh	And in this one we wrote out the twenty	sd	4
And in this one we wrote out the twenty	Ten	sd	2
Ten	Ten and then we	sd	2
You wrote out the ten	Yeah	b	1
Okay but Michaels approach was he could calculate the ten from Pascals Triangle	I think so	sv	4
I think so	I tried to find something that  when youre writing out things theres so much room for error	sd	4
I tried to find something that  when youre writing out things theres so much room for error	Oh there really is and you cant prove it	sd	2
Oh there really is and you cant prove it	I know	sd	2
I know	How do you know thats it	ba	3
How do you know thats it	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Just thats it	sd	1
Just thats it	I checked it five times already	sd	1
What about the probability of winning the series in exactly seven games	Thats whats left over	sd	4
Thats whats left over	Its the same	sd	2
Its the same	Its the same thing	sd	2
What do you mean	You just add those	sd	4
You just add those	Cause the series has to end in either four five six or seven games	sd	5
Okay	So if you add up four five and six	sd	4
So if you add up four five and six	Five and six the only thing left is	sd	2
Five and six the only thing left is	And subtract that from the whole	sd	2
And subtract that from the whole	From the whole then	sd	2
From the whole then	Then thats what you get	sv	2
What if you had to calculate it directly	We can still do what he did	sd	2
We can still do what he did	You still  you just continue on	sd	2
You still  you just continue on	We could always do what he did	sd	2
We could always do what he did	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Divide by half for the other line and go down	sd	2
Wanna take a shot at it	h thats four games five games six games	sd	4
h thats four games five games six games	Four or five six one more it would be  wouldnt it be	sd	2
Four or five six one more it would be  wouldnt it be	Four or five	sd	2
Four or five	One six fifteen  twenty right	sd	2
One six fifteen  twenty right	I would say forty out of  onetwenty	sd	2
I would say forty out of  onetwenty	One twentyeight which is	sd	2
One twentyeight which is	I dont I dont know if that equals a whole	sd	2
I dont I dont know if that equals a whole	It does	sd	2
It does	Does it	sd	2
Does it	Cause its twenty out of sixtyfour which was the same	sd	5
Cause its twenty out of sixtyfour which was the same	As ten out of	sd	2
As ten out of	Which is five out of sixteen	sd	2
Which is five out of sixteen	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Thats what we got last time	sd	2
Thats what we got last time	Its two out of sixteen four out of sixteen five and five	sd	2
Its two out of sixteen four out of sixteen five and five	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And that equals sixteen	sd	2
Are you checking that this agreed with the number you found earlier	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
How do you  could you show me that check	Thats what they reduce to	sd	2
Mhmm	And we got	sd	1
And we got	And that came to	sd	1
And that came to	Eleven sixteens	sd	2
Uh huh	And then we needed five more so you get sixteen sixteenths to get a whole	sd	5
And then we needed five more so you get sixteen sixteenths to get a whole	Which is forty out of one twentyeight	sd	2
Okay	Fivesixteenths	sd	4
So you  in the cases where you actually sort of got in and had to do the calculations had to sort of slog through the calculations in one way or another youre treating the last game as special and then youre looking at the possibilities that could lead up to it is that fair	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mhmm	aa	2
Um now youre assuming that the two teams are equally matched	Yes	b	1
And that was your explanation for the  the halves that came into it	Yeah but that that was	sd	1
Yeah but that that was	It was just one out of two right	sd	4
It was just one out of two right	Yeah that was that was stated in the in the problem too that they were equally matched	sd	2
Okay	Yes	aa	1
Yes	We didnt  I dont think we did but in the actual paper that we had written on	sd	1
Did you wonder what you would do if uh they werent equally matched	That would be a problem	sd	4
That would be a problem	No	sd	2
No	Youd have	sd	1
Youd have	Well how do you judge how much more  yeah how would you judge whos better and how much	aa	3
Well how do you judge how much more  yeah how would you judge whos better and how much	Yeah how would you say that	aa	3
Yeah how would you say that	Youd need a percent	sd	2
Youd need a percent	Yes	aa	2
Yes	How much better this team is than  better and by how much	sd	2
How much better this team is than  better and by how much	How much	sd	2
How much	You would need a fraction or a percentage	sd	2
You would need a fraction or a percentage	Well if he just gives us a percentage  you know what Im saying	sd	2
Well if he just gives us a percentage  you know what Im saying	No but if he just says that all right suppose team twos better	sd	2
No but if he just says that all right suppose team twos better	Well thats what Im saying	sd	2
Uh youre looking at maybe a whole season of games right	Mhmm	aa	1
How might you get a handle on it	You just  you just change the bottom number cause	sd	4
What would you look at	Cause we we look at their records and say	sd	4
Cause we we look at their records and say	Just look yeah	aa	2
Just look yeah	And you could find out how  it like shows you how much better Team A would be than Team B	sd	2
And you could find out how  it like shows you how much better Team A would be than Team B	Thats kind of like a opinion	sd	2
Thats kind of like a opinion	You think its better because the records	sv	2
You think its better because the records	Yeah but I mean where they played and	sd	2
Yeah but I mean where they played and	I would be better because I	sd	1
I would be better because I	Yeah you really dont know	aa	1
Yeah you really dont know	Anything can happen	sd	1
Anything can happen	Then that way each team doesnt have a fifty percent	sd	2
Then that way each team doesnt have a fifty percent	It dont matter after thirty one to one that one champion by one	sd	2
It dont matter after thirty one to one that one champion by one	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	I mean if you make purpose like	sd	2
I mean if you make purpose like	A concrete decision	sd	2
A concrete decision	Its kind of hard to put a value	sd	2
Its kind of hard to put a value	Uh that teams better than that team because they have a better record	sd	5
Uh that teams better than that team because they have a better record	Well I think the other team is better because they got a better pitcher	sd	5
Well I think the other team is better because they got a better pitcher	Uh huh	b	2
Uh huh	Its hard to  but if you were to say all right forget that the ones  one little win forty forty times  forty percent more than the other then   You undeTeachertand what Im saying	sd	2
Its hard to  but if you were to say all right forget that the ones  one little win forty forty times  forty percent more than the other then   You undeTeachertand what Im saying	Then regardless of what the team  like you could get us a percentage	sd	2
Then regardless of what the team  like you could get us a percentage	Sure you could do it but	sd	2
Um how often do you do you think that the teams are even evenly matched	Rarely	b	4
Rarely	Probably not	sd	2
Probably not	Yeah but thats left up to opinion	sd	2
Yeah but thats left up to opinion	I mean you could say that uh	sd	2
I mean you could say that uh	Some teams just dont do good  dont do well against the other teams because they take it for granted and then they play	sd	2
But would it be fair to  money most of the time	Thats why they have lines	sd	4
Thats why they have lines	Yeah theres never  anyway	sd	2
Cause youre saying youre saying that in general people have views that one team is likely to be better than the other	Well thats where the whole live situation comes in	sd	4
Well thats where the whole live situation comes in	Thats why they try to make it even	sd	2
Thats why they try to make it even	You figure that  this team is gonna touchdown better	sv	2
You figure that  this team is gonna touchdown better	And thats thats	sd	1
And thats thats	And theyre usually  I dont know what they do but theyre usually right on dude let me tell ya	sd	2
And theyre usually  I dont know what they do but theyre usually right on dude let me tell ya	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Its pretty good  Cause its always like  they just	sd	2
Its pretty good  Cause its always like  they just	They have to	sd	2
They have to	Like say like if  my teams playing s team my team will be  by say seven points	sd	2
Like say like if  my teams playing s team my team will be  by say seven points	If I dont if I dont beat em by more than seven then people at the  even know I won	sd	2
If I dont if I dont beat em by more than seven then people at the  even know I won	Its like giving me a seven nothing	sd	2
Its like giving me a seven nothing	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Exactly	aa	2
how would that effect it	You have more of a chance to win that  in the third games	sd	4
You have more of a chance to win that  in the third games	Well if theyre twice as likely then instead of multiplying it by a half it would be like two thirds	sd	5
Well if theyre twice as likely then instead of multiplying it by a half it would be like two thirds	Two thirds	sd	2
Two thirds	AA  I mean HHA	sd	2
AA  I mean HHA	Thats another thing like you would have like your  however many combinations	sd	2
Thats another thing like you would have like your  however many combinations	All right how many  like sixteen games you know like the fiTeachert one	sd	2
Mhmm	There was sixteen for one team and sixteen for another	sd	5
There was sixteen for one team and sixteen for another	And she would multiply that one sixteen by two because it will have  it will happen twice as many times as the other one	sd	5
Winning the series in exactly four games	Just like you said	sd	4
Why dont we just	What is it	ba	3
What is it	Home home away away home away home	sd	4
Home home away away home away home	OH oh you have to	qy	1
OH oh you have to	Just four games	sd	4
Just four games	The fiTeachert  when theyre equally matched you have um the home team has a one sixteen chance of winning	sd	5
The fiTeachert  when theyre equally matched you have um the home team has a one sixteen chance of winning	A  one eighth chance and the other one has a one eighth chance	sd	5
A  one eighth chance and the other one has a one eighth chance	You would add them together	sd	5
You would add them together	But this one eighth with um	sd	5
But this one eighth with um	no its one sixteenth	sd	5
no its one sixteenth	One sixteenth	sd	5
One sixteenth	One sixteenth	sd	5
One sixteenth	Now lets say this is the better team	sd	5
Yeah	They have twice  they come out twice as many times as this	sd	4
They have twice  they come out twice as many times as this	Just double it	sd	2
Just double it	Just double it so it would be a two sixteenth chance of	sd	5
Just double it so it would be a two sixteenth chance of	Just add another one sixteenth	sd	2
Just add another one sixteenth	Add another one sixteenth and the probability of uh	sd	2
Add another one sixteenth and the probability of uh	It would be over  wed have forty eight then	sd	2
It would be over  wed have forty eight then	What was the question	sd	3
What was the question	Probably that	sd	1
Suppose we believe that  say the home team is twice as likely to win any given game as the away team whats the probability of the World Series that the World Series would take exactly four games	Three out of sixteen	sd	4
How do you	You cant do three out of sixteen cause	sd	4
You cant do three out of sixteen cause	All right	b	1
How do you see that	I got three out of sixteen and it makes a little more sense because three out of sixteen is bigger than two out of sixteen	sd	5
I got three out of sixteen and it makes a little more sense because three out of sixteen is bigger than two out of sixteen	Yeah but wouldnt it be the same because the home team plays twice and the away team plays  twice at home	sd	5
Yeah but wouldnt it be the same because the home team plays twice and the away team plays  twice at home	So you figure they have the same advantage	sd	2
So you figure they have the same advantage	But if  if one team is better than the other	sd	2
But if  if one team is better than the other	Were not saying that were saying that the home team is twice as likely	sd	2
Were not saying that were saying that the home team is twice as likely	You said the home team	sd	2
You said the home team	No the  at their home stadium all right	sd	2
No the  at their home stadium all right	Or a specific team	sd	2
Or a specific team	Just say Team A and B dont worry about home	sd	2
Just say Team A and B dont worry about home	Then youre saying  yeah then youre saying  well thats like every  question because like if you ask  differently its all different	sd	5
Then youre saying  yeah then youre saying  well thats like every  question because like if you ask  differently its all different	All right you have Team A what was more likely to win	sd	2
All right you have Team A what was more likely to win	All right all right well	b	1
All right all right well	So therefore its gonna be so Team A is gonna  they have a better shot at winning it for  than the other one	sd	2
Yeah	So obviously its gonna be a little bigger	sd	4
All right all right	So like I  so the better team has a two out of sixteen chance of winning	sd	4
So like I  so the better team has a two out of sixteen chance of winning	And the  also has a sixteen	sd	2
And the  also has a sixteen	Yeah	b	2
Are you sure	It would be  am I sure	sd	1
It would be  am I sure	No	sd	1
No	I just said it	sd	1
Okay	Cause that one event of having Team A winning four times in a row is twice as likely  twice as more likely to happen to us	sd	5
Cause that one event of having Team A winning four times in a row is twice as likely  twice as more likely to happen to us	The other team	sd	5
What would be the numbeTeacher	One out of two	sd	4
One out of two	One out of two	sd	2
Are you reading the fraction 216 as symbolizing two out of sixteen	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yes	aa	2
Okay so now suppose Team A is twice as good as Team B whats the probability of Team A winning one game	Two out of three	sd	4
Two out of three	Mmhhmm	b	2
Mmhhmm	They have twice the chance so it leaves three chances to win	sd	2
They have twice the chance so it leaves three chances to win	So would that be three out of seventeen then	sd	2
So would that be three out of seventeen then	Is that what youre saying	sd	2
Is that what youre saying	Like you say how you go from one to two to two to three	sd	2
Like you say how you go from one to two to two to three	Yeah but if youre going from	sd	2
Yeah but if youre going from	Cause youre doing  look if theres a chance of Team A winning one game is two out of three winning game two is another two out of three	sd	5
Cause youre doing  look if theres a chance of Team A winning one game is two out of three winning game two is another two out of three	So it would be what Four out of nine of winning the fiTeachert two games	sd	5
So it would be what Four out of nine of winning the fiTeachert two games	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And then	sd	1
And then	Two out of three again	sd	2
Two out of three again	Would be eight out of twentyseven	sd	2
Would be eight out of twentyseven	Eight out of twentyseven and then two out of three again for winning four in the row	sd	2
Eight out of twentyseven and then two out of three again for winning four in the row	Which would be	sd	2
Which would be	Sixteen out of eightyone	sd	2
Sixteen out of eightyone	Or seven times three	sd	2
Or seven times three	Yeah so it was a	sd	2
Yeah so it was a	Sixteen out of eightyone	sd	2
Sixteen out of eightyone	Sixteen eightyone thats not gonna reduce	sd	2
Sixteen eightyone thats not gonna reduce	Thats with just Team A winning	sd	2
Thats with just Team A winning	Team A winning Team A winning	sd	2
Team A winning Team A winning	Four in a row	sd	2
Four in a row	And then	sd	1
And then	FiTeachert four and then you do the other thing	sd	2
FiTeachert four and then you do the other thing	Then it would be one one one	sd	2
Then it would be one one one	One out of three	sd	2
One out of three	One times  one out of three times   it would be one eightyone wouldnt it	sd	2
One times  one out of three times   it would be one eightyone wouldnt it	Mhmm	aa	2
Mhmm	Because one  not changing	sd	5
Because one  not changing	It would be seventeen out of eightyone	sd	2
It would be seventeen out of eightyone	Yeah seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone its gonna be one and four	sd	2
Yeah seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone its gonna be one and four	Its gonna be over in four games	sd	2
Its gonna be over in four games	A sixteen out of eightyone shot that team  the better team thats	sd	2
A sixteen out of eightyone shot that team  the better team thats	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	twice as betters gonna win in those games	sd	2
twice as betters gonna win in those games	And one out of eighty one chance that it  twice as bad	sd	2
And then finally the seventeen and the sixteen	Cause the probability is   you said Team A is twice as better as Team One	sd	5
Cause the probability is   you said Team A is twice as better as Team One	So the chance of Team A winning and winning one game at random is two  one  two out of three	sd	5
So the chance of Team A winning and winning one game at random is two  one  two out of three	Right	b	2
Right	Cause they have twice as	sd	5
Cause they have twice as	Cause they have twice twice as much shot as winning a game as Team B does	sd	5
Cause they have twice twice as much shot as winning a game as Team B does	So if for every two games Team A wins Team B will win one game	sd	5
Okay	So its two out of three	sd	4
Okay so its like  it looks like youre taking the games in groups of three then when youre thinking of that	Yes	aa	1
Okay	And then another game is two out of three again	sd	4
And then another game is two out of three again	multiplying together	sd	4
multiplying together	Just like we did like the one half	sd	2
OK	in the same situation	sd	4
in the same situation	Thats how we got  and then we do that four times to get the probability that Team A would win	sd	2
Thats how we got  and then we do that four times to get the probability that Team A would win	And then since the other one is only one third if you multiply one third times one third times one third one third before the top number is just one times one times one times one	sd	5
Uh huh	Saying three to the fourth equals eightyone	sd	5
Saying three to the fourth equals eightyone	And so that would be one out of eightyone and then we add that one to the sixteen out of eightyone and you  eightyone	sd	5
Is that right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mhmm	aa	2
So its not like the double that you did before	Mhmm	aa	1
Right	Thats why we did two out of three	sd	5
Thats why we did two out of three	Thats why we did that yeah yeah	sd	2
One or the other of the two teams winning the World Series in five games in exactly five games	Same situation where the other team is twice as better	sd	1
Same situation where the other team is twice as better	Is Team A twice as better as Team One	sd	1
Is twice as likely to win at giving  the second team	So for the next shot you figure that have a  at a  for the fourth game two out of the the  they have two out of three chance of winning that game	sd	4
So for the next shot you figure that have a  at a  for the fourth game two out of the the  they have two out of three chance of winning that game	Why dont we just do what he did I guess somehow	sd	2
Why dont we just do what he did I guess somehow	With that team	sd	2
With that team	The triangle	sd	2
The triangle	No like	sd	2
No like	The triangles not gonna work with this	sd	2
The triangles not gonna work with this	Its not	sd	2
Its not	I know	sd	2
I know	Would you multiply just by two thirds	sd	2
Would you multiply just by two thirds	Is that what we did	sd	2
Is that what we did	Seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone times two thirds	sd	5
Seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone times two thirds	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Seventeen eightyone times onethird	sd	5
Seventeen eightyone times onethird	And then add that	sd	5
And then add that	would be  yeah well seventeen eightyone times two thirds will be what	sd	3
would be  yeah well seventeen eightyone times two thirds will be what	Seventeen times  seventeen times two will be uh	sd	2
Seventeen times  seventeen times two will be uh	Thirtyfour	sd	2
Thirtyfour	Thats the probability of winning	sd	2
Thats the probability of winning	You have to take a	sd	1
You have to take a	And then we have to add	sd	2
And then we have to add	You have to take the probability of now  thats a  out of four games  need the probability of three out of four	sv	2
You have to take the probability of now  thats a  out of four games  need the probability of three out of four	And then adding the last part in	sd	2
And then adding the last part in	Because you have the  that that  sixteen eightyone or that seventeen out of	sd	5
Because you have the  that that  sixteen eightyone or that seventeen out of	Thats winning four	sd	2
Thats winning four	Thats winning four games	sd	2
Thats winning four games	And you cant play another game because someones already	sd	5
And you cant play another game because someones already	Then you have to subtract those too	sd	2
Then you have to subtract those too	You need you need you need to find out the probability of three out of four games instead of you know out of four	sd	2
You need you need you need to find out the probability of three out of four games instead of you know out of four	And its not seventeen eightyone or anything	sd	2
And its not seventeen eightyone or anything	What is it	ba	3
What is it	I dont know	sd	3
How would you go after this	Like what are you	sd	1
How would you go after it	got the probability of winning three out of four games	sd	4
got the probability of winning three out of four games	With Team A having twice a better chance of winning as Team B	sd	4
With Team A having twice a better chance of winning as Team B	Like three games	sd	2
Want to talk for a while and Ill join you in a couple of minutes	So if its fiftyfifty  three out of four whats that	sd	3
So if its fiftyfifty  three out of four whats that	Half one half one half	sd	2
Half one half one half	You couldnt write that in possibilities  could you	sv	2
You couldnt write that in possibilities  could you	See I dont know if its two thirds like that	sd	2
See I dont know if its two thirds like that	I mean it makes sense but in a game	sd	2
I mean it makes sense but in a game	Theres like	sd	1
Theres like	That made sense though	sd	2
That made sense though	Theres one  theres two	sd	2
Theres one  theres two	Four in a row made sense	sd	2
Four in a row made sense	Im still on this whole two thirds business	sd	2
Im still on this whole two thirds business	Cause the other game I mean all right out of	sd	2
Cause the other game I mean all right out of	What are you saying like Team A	sd	2
What are you saying like Team A	This is probably three out of four if its fiftyfifty	sd	2
This is probably three out of four if its fiftyfifty	Do you	qy	1
Do you	What three games out of four	sd	3
What three games out of four	Thats fiftyfifty	ba	2
Thats fiftyfifty	You wrote Team A and Team H	sd	2
You wrote Team A and Team H	Lets say they win one game Team A won two games	sd	2
Lets say they win one game Team A won two games	Its not  its eight right	sd	2
Its not  its eight right	Eight out of thirtytwo	sd	2
Eight out of thirtytwo	The A Team	sd	2
The A Team	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	It is two it is two out of three  they win they win two	sd	2
It is two it is two out of three  they win they win two	They win two	sd	2
They win two	Its like having this H or J	sd	2
Its like having this H or J	Or the other way around	sd	2
Or the other way around	Half	sd	2
Half	Show me what this is	sd	2
Show me what this is	All right if they had  if three times is	sd	2
All right if they had  if three times is	Thats what I was thinking	sd	2
Thats what I was thinking	And theres a two thirds chance of that happening or one third one third one third	sd	2
And theres a two thirds chance of that happening or one third one third one third	One third one third one third and then switch it up  were at two third two third two third one third	sd	2
One third one third one third and then switch it up  were at two third two third two third one third	Yeah so it would be  and we need  four of those right	sd	2
Yeah so it would be  and we need  four of those right	Eightyone  two over eightyone	sd	2
Eightyone  two over eightyone	Then four of them right	sd	2
Then four of them right	Because then we put the A over here	sd	5
Because then we put the A over here	Yeah and then you figure that out of all those two eighty ones	sd	2
Yeah and then you figure that out of all those two eighty ones	And then the other way is	sd	2
And then the other way is	And thatll be two times	sd	2
And thatll be two times	Thats eighty or eightyone	ba	2
Thats eighty or eightyone	And then theres four of those	sd	2
And then theres four of those	So thatll be three  yeah	sd	2
So thatll be three  yeah	So thatll be three out of eightyone	sd	2
So thatll be three out of eightyone	So it	sd	1
So it	Add that so its forty out of eightyone	sd	2
Add that so its forty out of eightyone	All right so say forty out of eightyone chance thats almost half a chance its gonna run a fifth game	sd	2
All right so say forty out of eightyone chance thats almost half a chance its gonna run a fifth game	Well that makes sense though	sd	2
Well that makes sense though	Because the one  manage	sd	5
Because the one  manage	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So its going to be	sv	1
So its going to be	to seven	sd	2
to seven	Chances are chances are the high amounts are gonna be in the early games	sd	2
Chances are chances are the high amounts are gonna be in the early games	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Well thats half And that one was eight thirtytwo	sd	2
Well thats half And that one was eight thirtytwo	Which ones are thirty	sd	3
Which ones are thirty	Yeah but the other side has an advantage its almost twice	sd	2
Yeah but the other side has an advantage its almost twice	Not that much of an advantage	sd	2
Not that much of an advantage	Yeah they twice as good	sd	2
Yeah they twice as good	Twice as good	sd	2
Twice as good	Twice as good	sd	2
Twice as good	Three out of thirtytwo I mean	sd	2
Three out of thirtytwo I mean	I mean if you even look at	sd	1
I mean if you even look at	Cause look  if you look at it its not supposed to go to seven games cause then you need four and three instead of four and two	sd	5
Cause look  if you look at it its not supposed to go to seven games cause then you need four and three instead of four and two	I mean but	sd	1
I mean but	It could go up to seven	sd	2
It could go up to seven	Yeah it could	sd	2
Yeah it could	I know its not its highly unlikely	sd	2
I know its not its highly unlikely	It  s less likely	sd	2
It  s less likely	Its still likely	sd	2
Its still likely	Less likely and that one is only eight out of	sd	2
Less likely and that one is only eight out of	Thats not gonna be zero	sd	2
Thats not gonna be zero	And if you look at it in terms of eightyone I mean eight out of thirtytwo thats like almost  its more  if you put it in terms of eightyone	sd	5
And if you look at it in terms of eightyone I mean eight out of thirtytwo thats like almost  its more  if you put it in terms of eightyone	Because eightyone	sd	5
Because eightyone	Want to do this out of five games then	sd	2
Want to do this out of five games then	Hm	b	1
Hm	Lets see what it looks like	sd	2
Lets see what it looks like	See if were  on the same	sd	2
See if were  on the same	This will be different	sd	2
This will be different	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So the one team has to win three games	sd	2
So the one team has to win three games	one three	sd	2
one three	We screwed this one up	sd	2
We screwed this one up	Theres got to be less than theres got to be less than eightyone	sd	2
Theres got to be less than theres got to be less than eightyone	up isnt there	sd	2
up isnt there	Theres another H isnt there	sd	2
Theres another H isnt there	Well you look at it	sd	1
Well you look at it	Are we still winning those	sd	2
Are we still winning those	Thats what I was gonna say	sd	2
Thats what I was gonna say	No ones winning this	sd	2
No ones winning this	You know what I mean	sd	2
You know what I mean	Have to get another H	sd	5
Have to get another H	So we just did eightyfour games and it should have been  its over eightyone times three	sd	5
So we just did eightyfour games and it should have been  its over eightyone times three	Two fortythree	sd	2
Two fortythree	Umdoes this make more sense then	sd	2
Umdoes this make more sense then	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Sixteen  sixteen out of  did you get a half or something	sd	2
Sixteen  sixteen out of  did you get a half or something	Not its not	sd	2
Not its not	Thats cause we did cause we did  this and thats only three games out of	sd	5
Thats cause we did cause we did  this and thats only three games out of	Actually its almost a half chance of winning three out of four games	sd	5
Actually its almost a half chance of winning three out of four games	Then multiply that by	sd	5
Then multiply that by	I did like for the  before we had Team A  when it was a fiftyfifty chance they had a four out of sixteen chance of winning three games out of four	sd	2
I did like for the  before we had Team A  when it was a fiftyfifty chance they had a four out of sixteen chance of winning three games out of four	Right	b	2
Right	You know that	sd	2
You know that	The four and that	sd	2
The four and that	And then um but this is the better team	sd	2
And then um but this is the better team	It has a  for every one game this team wins this team wins too	sd	2
It has a  for every one game this team wins this team wins too	You know what Im saying	sd	2
You know what Im saying	Like the twice  to win	sd	2
Like the twice  to win	Sixtyfour	sd	2
Sixtyfour	So you  theyre probably now eight sixtyfour	sd	5
So you  theyre probably now eight sixtyfour	Its double	sd	5
Its double	And then to win the last game its still twothirds cause one is two thirds more than the other	sd	5
And then to win the last game its still twothirds cause one is two thirds more than the other	This one comes out to eight	sd	5
This one comes out to eight	Why is that one two thirds	sd	3
Why is that one two thirds	I thought this one was better	sd	2
I thought this one was better	Um yeah	b	2
Um yeah	That would be four to   This is sixteen	sd	2
That would be four to   This is sixteen	Uh this would be twenty out of fortyeight	sd	2
Uh this would be twenty out of fortyeight	Yeah twenty out of fortyeight	sd	2
Yeah twenty out of fortyeight	Itll be over in five days	sd	2

Um the probability that I was about Team A won won those twenty games  sixteen out of twenty	Okay	b	1
Okay	Probably just when you  winning winning the fifth game itll be twenty fortyeighty	sd	2

I dont think so	before the guy told me to stop	sd	2
before the guy told me to stop	told him I couldnt	sd	2
told him I couldnt	I was saying that before and he was like oh lets think of something else	sd	2
I was saying that before and he was like oh lets think of something else	So its probably wrong	sd	2

Explain this one	Me and  worked on a little something	sd	1
Me and  worked on a little something	And we  this is what we got	sd	1
And we  this is what we got	Theres a five game series right	sd	4
Theres a five game series right	When this is like one way that one team could win	sd	4
Could you do this at the board	No	sd	1
No	Yeah	b	1
I dont believe you	Can I erase this	sd	1
Yes	You can erase that	sd	1
Okay	You got that problem	sd	1
You got that problem	Its 1309 miles off the	sd	4
Its 1309 miles off the	I didnt even do it	sd	1
I didnt even do it	I didnt even attempt that	sd	1
I didnt even attempt that	Ill bring you there in two and a half houTeacher	sd	1
Ankur would you erase the  in that whole section	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	This	sd	1
This	We used five heads	sd	1
We used five heads	This was one of the ways of winning uh the world series	sd	4
Uh huh	And then since Team As twice as likely to win as Team B the chances of this happening is two thirds	sd	5
And then since Team As twice as likely to win as Team B the chances of this happening is two thirds	And this is one third	sd	5
Cause youre gonna talk in As and Bs	As the better one	sd	4
As the better one	Why dont you make B better	sd	1
Why dont you make B better	A  better	sd	1
A  better	Go for it man	sd	1
Go for it man	A better	sd	1
A better	And then just multiply that across right	sd	4
And then just multiply that across right	Cause thats the  the probability of this happening	sd	5
Why do you multiply this time	The same reason the last time	sd	4
Which is	Jump in	sd	1
Jump in	Cause its the right thing to do	sd	1
Cause its the right thing to do	Cause you know it thats what youre supposed to do	sv	1
Cause you know it thats what youre supposed to do	You know youre not supposed to add	sd	4
You know youre not supposed to add	It  s an instinct	sd	1
It  s an instinct	I was born with it	sd	1
Because the	I really do I	sd	1
I really do I	Every time youre putting two probabilities because like I said were always  well not always but like we  whether we know it we have to multiply em	sd	5
Every time youre putting two probabilities because like I said were always  well not always but like we  whether we know it we have to multiply em	When theyre constructed as	sd	2
When theyre constructed as	So why should this be different than any other case	sd	3
Last time you actually showed me why you multiplied	I dont even want to show you this time	sd	1
I dont even want to show you this time	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How did we do that	sd	3
How did we do that	So just remember what we said	sd	1
So just remember what we said	Its different	sd	4
That was a different situation where the two teams were equally matched	But how is that different	sd	3
But how is that different	Its just  were just doing	sd	1
Its just  were just doing	There was a fifty percent chance of each thing happening and we multiplied it this time which was sixty sixty	sd	5
There was a fifty percent chance of each thing happening and we multiplied it this time which was sixty sixty	Thirtythree	sd	2
Thirtythree	And were still multiplying	sd	2
And were still multiplying	Were changing anything but the chance of the team winning	sd	5
Were changing anything but the chance of the team winning	So it cant be any different	sd	5
Go on go on and explain the rest of this	All right	b	1
Okay	If you multiply it across you get two out of  what was it  two two eightythree	sd	5
If you multiply it across you get two out of  what was it  two two eightythree	Two fortythree of that happening	sd	5
Two fortythree of that happening	And then you can have the A in each of the four places	sd	5
Uh huh	You cant have it in the last cause then one  four game series and its over	sd	5
You cant have it in the last cause then one  four game series and its over	So you multiply this four times	sv	5
Wait youre doing this youre doing this for a five game series or a four games series	Five game series	sd	4
Five game series	You just add that	sd	2
What would you do for a four game series	You would multiply it three times	sd	4
You would multiply it three times	Youre adding that	sd	2
Yeah but what would you do for the four game series	You	aa	1
You	Four games its either    remember the other one we did before	sd	4
Four games its either    remember the other one we did before	Remember he was he was watching us	sd	1
Oh yeah you were here	You would add that four times	sd	4
Lets go over the five game series	yeah	b	1
So youve looked at one possible five game series where B can  where B comes out	Mhmm	aa	1
Is that the only way	can happen one two three or four its eight out of two fortythree	sd	4
can happen one two three or four its eight out of two fortythree	It cant happen in the last one	sd	4
You mean that the A could be in one out of four places	Yes	aa	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
So then so there are four possibilities	Yeah so it would be eight out of two hundred and fortythree that Team A  Team B would win	sd	4
And in each of those cases were the As in a different place  Are you taking the same product in the fractures	Yes	b	1
You are	Wait wait what did you say	sd	1
Okay suppose A won the second game instead of the fiTeachert so it would be A	It would be the same thing  B  A	sd	4
It would be the same thing  B  A	Its gonna be the same	sd	2
Will there be a two thirds under the B at the beginning	No  same as A	sd	4
No  same as A	The two thirds would be here	sd	2
The two thirds would be here	Its the other way around	sd	2
Uh huh	So instead of just moving the two thirds	sd	4
So instead of just moving the two thirds	The  matteTeacher because the other game is	sd	5
Are you saying you would you get the same product with the two third in those different places	Yes why wouldnt you	aa	3
Yes why wouldnt you	Cause you still have four one thirds and one two thirds	sd	5
Why would you	Its like A times B times C	sd	4
Its like A times B times C	Youre multiplying the same numbeTeacher except in different order	sd	2
Okay	So that would be eight out of two fortythree	sd	4
Okay	Its working now right	sd	1
So	If Team A won the four games right	sd	4
Yeah	It would just be  I love that noise	sd	1
It would just be  I love that noise	Like that	sd	1
oh	And then when you multiply that twice you get sixteen out of two fortythree	sd	5
And then when you multiply that twice you get sixteen out of two fortythree	And for the same reason as before theres  it can be in four different places	sd	5
Mhmm	Then that would be sixtyfour and forty three	sd	4
Then that would be sixtyfour and forty three	Add them together	sd	4
Add them together	Then you add em together and you get seventytwo out of two fortythree	sd	2
What	That reduces right	aa	4
Ahhh	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Seventytwo is a multiple of nine right	sd	4
Seventytwo is a multiple of nine right	Two fortythree out of	sd	2
Two fortythree out of	Is a multiple of nine	sd	2
Is a multiple of nine	Whats uh two fortythrees	sd	3
Whats uh two fortythrees	Bring it over into five and six	sd	2
Bring it over into five and six	Whats nine times  whats two	sd	3
Whats nine times  whats two	Who cares	sd	1
I do	Its always  its probably come up in the same  order	sd	4
What does it come out to be	Twentyseven	sd	2
Twentyseven	Divide that by nine	sd	2
Divide that by nine	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Twenty seven out of	sd	2
Twenty seven out of	Eight	sd	2
Eight	The other one was eight out of	sd	2
The other one was eight out of	The other one was what	sd	3
The other one was what	Eight out of thirtytwo	sd	2
Oh	Thats something	sd	1
Why did you whistle	Im excited	sd	1
So thats a five game series	for a week	sd	1
Other	I was just guessing	sd	1
I was just guessing	Maybe the top number stays the same and the bottom numbeTeacher the one that changes	sd	4
Maybe the top number stays the same and the bottom numbeTeacher the one that changes	Im not willing to prove that because I dont know why	sd	3
Im not willing to prove that because I dont know why	Yeah you cant prove it	sd	2
Tell me why youre guessing then	Guessing	sd	1
Guessing	It happens	sd	1
It happens	Because the five games series has eight out of x or whatever	sd	5
Because the five games series has eight out of x or whatever	And the other one has eight out of another number	sd	5
And the other one has eight out of another number	So Im just thinking maybe	sd	5
So Im just thinking maybe	We get the four game series  on there	sd	2
We get the four game series  on there	Seventeen out of eightyone	sd	2
Seventeen out of eightyone	Maybe thats a coincidence maybe its not	sd	2
Maybe thats a coincidence maybe its not	I hope its not	sd	2
Okay so what about a six game series	They didnt tell us	sd	1
They didnt tell us	Check it out	sd	1
You want to check it out	What is three new things	sd	3
What is three new things	Twentyseven right	sd	4
Twentyseven right	is twentyseven	sd	4
I always thought so	third is eightytwo	sd	4
Two to   isnt that eight	Its eight	sd	4
Its eight	A ll right	sd	1
A ll right	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	Im not good	sd	1
Okay	No whats thirtytwo	ba	3
No whats thirtytwo	Its two times  fifth	sd	4
Its two times  fifth	Two four	sd	2
Two four	Eight	sd	2
Eight	Eight	sd	2
Eight	Sixteen	sd	2
Sixteen	Im bad with math	sd	1
Im bad with math	In my head	sd	1
Now I want to come back to the multiplication	Mhmm	aa	1
Okay	Its like that  in the fiTeachert place	sd	1
Its like that  in the fiTeachert place	Like  two things right	sd	4
Like  two things right	Oh this	sd	2
Oh this	Yeah cause	b	2
Yeah	But like you have a fifty percent chance of winning and you have a fifty percent chance of winning right and you multiply them together	sd	5
But like you have a fifty percent chance of winning and you have a fifty percent chance of winning right and you multiply them together	Right	b	1
Now what I remember here was that  it was like we  we chose to look at a simpler situation which is what happens in two games in a row right	Mhmm	aa	1
That way	anything	sd	1
anything	You havent said anything in a while huh	sd	1
I want to hear from everybody	I want to hear from her	sd	1
I want to hear from her	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	The probabilities of what	sd	3
The probabilities of what	Of the team winning both those games	sd	4
What are the probabilities of those things happening	In the fiTeachert game we may have a two thirds chance of winning right	sd	4
Right	They always tell us to multiply	sd	1
They always tell us to multiply	They never tell us why	sd	1
They never tell us why	Then you tell us  why and we dont know	sd	1
Am I wrong to wonder	No	sd	1
No	No thats	ba	1
No thats	Youre asking us why were doing something thats what you told us to do	sd	1
Youre asking us why were doing something thats what you told us to do	If you say that	sd	1
Are you curious	No	sd	1
No	No	sd	1
No	If it works man	sd	1
If it works man	But only if someone would tell us once	sd	1
How do you know it works	Well because it worked for this one	sd	5
Well because it worked for this one	Cause its the same reasoning	sd	5
Cause its the same reasoning	Yeah were assuming if it works with that one	sd	5
Yeah were assuming if it works with that one	It only changes the percentage of the chance to win	sd	2
It only changes the percentage of the chance to win	Okay	b	1
Okay	Youre assuming it	sd	1
Youre assuming it	Um is it is it a safe assumption	sd	1
Um is it is it a safe assumption	How would you how would you	aa	1
How would you how would you	Its not a safe assumption	sd	4
Its not a safe assumption	When when multiplying uh we need to flip two coins	sd	2
When when multiplying uh we need to flip two coins	multiplying those two Is that the same question youre asking us	sd	1
multiplying those two Is that the same question youre asking us	Do you undeTeachertand why you multiply by half	qy	2
Do you undeTeachertand why you multiply by half	By two halves	sd	2
Im not worried Im not worried when the chances are fiftyfifty	PeTeacheronally I would not	sd	4
But Im wondering what happens when theyre not	When you when you  when the chances are fiftyfifty you multiply probably the fiTeachert one coming and probably the second one	sd	5
Right	Now it will make a difference if one  is different	sd	4
Now it will make a difference if one  is different	Youre just multiplying	sd	2
Youre just multiplying	If youve got a fixed	sd	2
If youve got a fixed	Youve still got those	sd	2
Youve still got those	From the fiTeachert one and you would still do the  just that ones different wouldnt change anything	sd	2
From the fiTeachert one and you would still do the  just that ones different wouldnt change anything	He just wants to straighten out the possibilities and	sd	2
He just wants to straighten out the possibilities and	Why	b	3
Why	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Why  I mean you  the fiTeachert event the fiTeachert coin coming up heads the second event  the second coin coming up heads	sd	2
Why  I mean you  the fiTeachert event the fiTeachert coin coming up heads the second event  the second coin coming up heads	Half and half is one in four chance of them both happening you know the same time	sd	2
Half and half is one in four chance of them both happening you know the same time	So if one coin comes out has more than the other why wouldnt you multiply that	sd	3
So if one coin comes out has more than the other why wouldnt you multiply that	I mean you undeTeachertand	sd	2
I mean you undeTeachertand	If you have  if youre doing one half youre still multiplying both probabilities	sd	2
Why wouldnt you add	A lot	sd	1
A lot	Yes	b	1
Yes	I really dont understand it	sd	1
I really dont understand it	Teacher arent we allowed to	sd	1
Yes yes yes yes	I said just leave it	sd	1
Ravi your punishment lines	Oh yes	b	1
As first thing before I forget again	that too	sd	1
Okay	Wasnt that twice then	sd	1
Wasnt that twice then	Twice we were supposed to didnt we	sd	1
Twice we were supposed to didnt we	Oh	b	1
Which one of you ever heard of Pyth Pythagoras	Uh	b	1
Uncle Pete	Pete Pete Pete	sd	1
Tell us what do you know about it	Its a gentleman	sd	1
Its a gentleman	A squared plus B squared equals C squared	sd	4
Who else can say more about it	Uh I think this guy was a Greek	sd	1
The uh this gentleman was Greek	Yup	aa	1
Does anyone know when you would use the Pythagoras theorem and what you would use it for	Yes in a diagram	sd	4
We have different types of triangles	Rightangled	b	4
We have a rightangled triangle	Isosceles	sd	4
What is a characteristic of a rightangled triangle	It has it has one	sd	1
Ruben	It has a right angle	sd	4
What other kinds of triangles do we have	An isosceles triangle	sd	4
What is characteristic of an isosceles triangle	Two equal sides	sd	4
Maarten	That A and B are equal	sd	4
Which one	Equally shaped	sd	4
An equilateral triangle	Oh	b	1
Julie	All sides are equal	sd	4
Would there be anything else I can mention about an equilateral triangle	Um all angles are equal	sd	4
And can we tell how wide they are	Yes 180 divided by three	sd	4
One hundred eighty divided by three and that is	Sixty	b	4
Do we have any other rightangled side in there	Yes	b	1
But if you see this triangle what can we call that side	The long side	sd	4
Or in a different way	The right side	sd	4
Namely Maarten	The square root of 37	sd	4
By which method	Well I think you have to up on top of the large square oh no thats something you dont know	sv	4
Yes though	Yes then you have to uh remove those angles or uh yes well thats how you get the small square	sd	4
How much	Uh nine centimeters squared	sd	4
Willem	I dont know how you calculate it but I can just see it	sd	3
What is the outcome according to you if you are just able to see it	Um four in total comes off because one of those uh	sd	5
One of these triangles	That is one	sd	4
Okay	And there are four of those	sd	4
Leni	You make it into a rectangle	sd	4
And then	We calculate the surface area	sd	4
Namely that is	The square root of five	sd	4
We may not even need Pythagoras at all	No	b	1
Well if I place them on top of one another they are indeed if I place them very neatly on top of each other equal in size	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	Approximately	sd	4
They are really equal in size but they stick a bit	Yes	b	1
Convinced	Yes	b	1
We will lay it down just like it is shown in the diagram in the book	Which question	sd	3
Is one lying incorrectly	No	b	1
Those triangles those four triangles that are lying over here are equal in size as the triangles that are lying over there	Yes	b	1
What am I able to say about the surface of this square and that square	They are equally big as the other ones	sd	4
then what is the surface area of the square that is attached to it	Twelve times 12	sd	4
And that is	One hundred fortyfour	sd	4
One hundred fortyfour	Without a calculator	sd	1
Without a calculator	Oh yes	b	1
The short side that is five	Twentyfive	sd	4
What do I know about the large square then	One hundred fortyfour plus 25	sd	4
Namely	Half of 12	sd	4
Half of 12	Twelve	sd	2
Twelve	The square root of 169	sd	2
This one was 144 plus 25 is then 169	So the length is 13	sd	4
But now we are going to construct very generally	Now I get it	sd	1
Then you can always retrieve it	Yak	sd	1
So we will write that down one rightangled side squared	Are you supposed to	sd	1
Yup	You are supposed to copy that thing right	sv	1
What I am writing down you have to copy	Oh	b	1
Oh	Ah	b	1
Since I wont be needing this one anymore	The table is slanted	sd	1
By now you guys must know that I am crazy about diagrams and tables and things like that	Yes we knew that because you already told us yesterday	sd	1
Well if you copy this Ravi itll speed up your homework for you will have done this assignment already	fast hey	sd	1
And the squared value actually represents the surface area of the square that you placed on the sides	Yes	b	1
Yes	What	ba	1
I need the one rightangled side I need the other rightangled side	Yes	b	1
Ladies would you please just be a little more quiet as well	They are filming in this chicken coop	sd	1
Am I	She is sick	sd	1
And that gives you	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Oh that is four times four and three times three and then subtract	sd	5
Oh that is four times four and three times three and then subtract	Then the other one is five	sd	2
And that leaves me with five	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I already knew that	sd	1
Any questions about this	Yes but it is no	sd	1
Regardless that you say yes but	Oh like that yes yes I got it	sd	1
Myrte	But it says uh the other rightangled side equals the hypotenuse squared but do we have to take the square root of it instead of uh squaring it	sd	4
The general equation therefore is uh Rick could you please go into the hallway now	Bye	sd	1
Therefore if you want to know what the hypotenuse is then you have to take the root of the number representing the hypotenuse squared	Is it squared and then you have to yes okay	sd	4
This whole table over here shows these numbers squared	Yes	b	1
Very well	You figured it out	sd	1
They just learned it kind of like this is how it is so you better get to work with it	A squared plus B squared equals	sd	4
A squared plus B squared equals	Oh right	b	1
Okay	shows the thing squared there	sd	4
The surface area of the square	Like that would help	sd	1
Thats homework	You are being filmed	sd	1
You are being filmed	They will just edit that out	sd	1
They will just edit that out	Thats right	aa	1
Thats right	Each time Ravis head will be cut out	sd	1
Each time Ravis head will be cut out	Yes	b	1
You guys still have 20 minutes left	Twenty	sd	1
Twenty	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
The only advice Ill give you on exercise 11 a lot is written down about triangles there	The only thing	sd	1
The only thing	Yes it is fine like that	sd	1
Half of you are now missing this instruction	Oh oh sorry you have it right here	sd	1
Yes	Yes understood	sd	1
From now on I really want it to be quiet when I am instructing	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
You are one of the few or one of the few together with a few more but there are several who want nothing but to pay attention	Yes	b	1
If you keep on disrupting then you are disrupting everyone	Yes	b	1
And certainly me	Yes	b	1
Just put it on uh	It doesnt make any sense you dont feel	sd	1
Yes no dont close it completely just put it on I do want some oxygen to come in	The heater is still on	sd	1
Otherwise I would be the first one to turn it off	Here two plus four plus six	sd	5

We just did that on the board on the other side	Yes I already have it	sd	1
Ladies and gentlemen the fact that I have my back turned towards you doesnt mean you are allowed to turn things upside down	I agree	aa	1
What can you make of this of that one triangle	A uh rectangle	sd	4
What is the surface area then of that rectangle	Eight times six is 48	sd	5
And what part of the triangle is it	I dont know	sd	1
Considering you know that the whole rectangle because you said its six times eight	This one is 24	sd	4
This one is 24	Twentyfour squares	sd	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
Maarten whisper	I dont know it anymore	sd	1
Ladies should be whispering as well	I still dont understand G eight	sd	3
We have a tiler who uses white as well as blue tiles	Yes	b	1
The white ones as well as the blue ones	Yes	b	1
Five tiles together make the square A B C D A B C D What is the surface area of that square	Um	sd	1
Sorry	Twentyfive	sd	4
You know that every tile the white one as well as the blue one is one square decimeter	Yes	b	1
What is the length then of A B given the surface area of that square is five	The square root of five	sd	4
Because if later on you you read it again you wont know how you get that square root of five	Yes	b	1
Now we have to fill in the length of A E A E goes from here to there	Is two times AB	sd	4
But you dont have to do that here yet that will come later on	to write the two differently	sd	1
You knew that the square root of 16 was equal to four	Yes	b	1
Yes	Oh uh it is equal to uh the square root of four	sd	4
Look the two was correct but	Oh yes	b	1
Try to do the rest of them now too	Yes	b	1
Yes	Look I have a question since yesterday I had something from chapter one	sd	3
Oh yes	And um look this is for example um the regular square	sd	1
Yes	And that one is 40 square centimeters	sd	5
And that one is 40 square centimeters	So the reduction goes to 10 square centimeters	sd	5
So the reduction goes to 10 square centimeters	Then the factor isnt four is it	sd	5
No	It is two isnt it	sd	4
Correct because the surface area becomes four times smaller	Yes	b	1
But your magnifying factor will be the square root of that	So if you have for example a really large number for instance uh well yes I dont know uh for example with five numbers	sd	4
Yes	And uh it becomes a lot smaller you have to divide it by four	sd	5
And uh it becomes a lot smaller you have to divide it by four	So uh the magnifying factor with reduction has to be divided by four whereas if you make it from small to large it is times four	sd	5
So uh the magnifying factor with reduction has to be divided by four whereas if you make it from small to large it is times four	Okay	b	1
You were first	I just have a question	sd	3
Yes	Uh could it also be that you only get this number	sd	4
Yes	So this one and that one and then all you have to do is calculate this one here	sd	4
Very good	Okay	b	1
Great	Where is this key on my pocket calculator	sd	1
Where is this key on my pocket calculator	Oh it is fine right	aa	1
And this is your root	So its the same thing	sd	4
This is your root	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yes	b	1
Was it clear for you guys	Yes	b	1
You keep track of this a little too I hope	Yes yes I just wrote it down	sd	1
Oh okay	Thats just the nature of the assignment	sd	1
Is this one clear to you guys	Yeah sure	b	1
Really	Yes with the explanation earlier it made it in any case clearer	sd	1
Yes with the explanation earlier it made it in any case clearer	But in the beginning it seemed a bit weird but now I understand it	sd	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes okay	aa	1
Yes okay	The same problem	sd	1
But it is allowed youll still work through it	And uh the square root of	sd	4
And uh the square root of	The square root of six	sd	4
The square root of six	Yes	b	1
But if you want to calculate that one what do you need then	Then I can just this one like that	sd	1
But since I have already explained it and as you understand it then as far as I am concerned you can go ahead and use it	Yes	b	1
Yes	If you want to measure this side	sd	1
Yes	Then you have to this is 225	sd	4
Yes	And this is 64	sd	4
Yes	Then arent you supposed to take two 225 plus 64	sd	4
Yes	Is 289	aa	4
Yes indeed that square	That you have to make into a square root	sd	4
Yes very good	So that becomes 17 then	sd	4
So that becomes 17 then	And that is 17	sd	4
Not only uh writing down the answers	Oh	b	1
Oh	Ehm look here	sd	1
Ehm look here	Can you see it	sd	1
Yes I can see it	One hundred ninetysix square meters	sd	4
What exercise are you working on	Oh with um three	sd	1
And what is this 196	That is the whole garden	sd	4
Yes	Then I have to do minus	sd	4
Yes	Twentyfour square meters	sd	4
Yes	But doesnt that just become can you just take this off then like like in the same way if there wasnt a square meter on here	sd	4
Yes because the whole garden is in square meters	I must be confusing it with something else then	sd	4
So you can easily subtract square meters from square meters	Now I dont understand any of this anymore	sd	3
That is the same thing you will do with the garden	Yes fine	aa	1
Okay	This is how it should be done	sd	1
This is how it should be done	Like this	sd	1
Perfect very nice	Of course not are you crazy or something	sd	1
Of course not are you crazy or something	But you were too warm werent you	sd	1
But you were too warm werent you	Yes right I will just go and sit here without my Tshirt in my bare chest	sd	1
I mean uh	Then itll get even colder	sd	1
Are you cold	Yes	b	1
Yes	Very badly	b	1
Very badly	only wearing this really thin thing	sd	1
You arent going to infect your sister are you	No she is she is already sick	sd	1
She is at home though	Yes	b	1
And have you changed her yet or are you going to leave that to	Because I did that by myself	sd	1
Yes	I am allowed to carry her into the church for the baptism	sd	1
Oh you dont like that	Well I do think it is kind of neat and all	sd	1
Well I do think it is kind of neat and all	Yes	b	1
Yes	Wow	aa	1
Wow	Well wonderful	sd	1
Well wonderful	No I think it is kind of neat	sv	1
Yes	Do you have the answer booklets	sd	1
Yes	Shirley isnt here and uh	sd	1
Sixty	A B	sd	1
And who normally sits next to	Sander	sd	1
Oh yes	Four times the square root of 20 is eh	sd	4
And Maarten	We just have to calculate this one so we have to take half	sd	4
We just have to calculate this one so we have to take half	And then	sd	3
And then	Well then	sd	1
Will you indicate how you got the numbers	Oh yes I will	sd	1
Ill need it again in a minute	Sixtyfour	sd	4
Sixtyfour	And then this you have to add together	sd	4
No	Which makes 89	sd	4
No they have been here on Tuesday and now	What class was that then	sd	1
On Tuesday it was A 2 C	With Dennis	sd	1
Yes	Teacher	b	1
Yes	Can you check exercise three for a moment	sd	1
Of course	Because if I have that one correct then	sd	1
Then you understand it you mean	Yes because I am not sure if I understand it	sd	1
But if you understand it then it doesnt matter at all	No I took the old method I think	sd	4
No I took the old method I think	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	That is the new one	sd	4
Yes that one wont be explained until the next paragraph	Oh so according to the book I am actually working ahead	sd	1
All right	Here it says how big is the  and here Ive got five but do you just have to	sd	4
Because the surface area of the square is five	Yes	b	1
So the side that is just one side	Yes	b	1
Is the root of this	Oh yes	b	1
Sorry	This square over here has four points	sd	4
You may draw it	draw it	sd	1
But you dont have to	I got it right	sd	1
It should I believe	How does one calculate this	sd	3
How much is what what is the surface area again of one of these angles	Twenty	sd	4
And how many of those little squares do I have in here	Twenty	sd	4
Twenty	Yes but I thought	sd	1
Because they are determining how you can write things in a different way	Okay	b	1
Yes	Yes okay	aa	1
Yes okay	Heinjan and I are going to BEVO shortly	sd	1
Yes fine	We have a test to take	sd	1
Yes	Hey hey Ravi you still have to uh take the test as well	sd	1
Hey hey Ravi you still have to uh take the test as well	May I come along with you	sd	1
May I come along with you	Then you have to come right now	sd	1
Then you have to come right now	Never mind Ill go I also have to go to BEVO	sd	1
Well go ahead then	Where is	sd	1
Just to the restroom	In the rectangle one diagonal	sd	4
In the rectangle one diagonal	It is explained over here	sd	1
Well that is explained with the surfaces	Yes	b	1
How that works	Oh that is right here	aa	1
Yes	Oh with the surface area	sd	1
And then over here it is explained again and then you can continue on working	It is 14	sd	2
It was uh chapter one wasnt it	Yes	b	1
Yes	Sorry that one is wrong	sd	4
Sorry that one is wrong	This is also wrong	sd	4
This is also wrong	No its not	sd	2
No its not	Yes it is	sd	2
Yes it is	Dont make me cry	sd	1
Is it that bad	Check your answer by measuring this in your diagram	sd	4
Check your answer by measuring this in your diagram	The numbers on your triangle have completely faded	sd	1
Yes	do wrong	sd	1
Excuse me	I dont see why this is wrong here	sd	3
What is done wrong here	Look it  is wrong but how are you supposed to know	sd	3
Why dont you make a diagram of that triangle	One like that	sd	1
Yes	Oh here	aa	1
Yes	Is it if you uh write it down like this because you have to measure the other rightangled side	sd	5
Yes	Then is this uh correct then because uh	sd	4
Like do I need 41 or do I need 40 or do I need nine	Yes	b	1
Then you can just say the other side is well what did you calculate	Yup	aa	1
So you still have to give an answer because otherwise I will have to search in such a diagram	Yup	aa	1
And you know that I will always find the wrong one	Well what I mean is	sd	1
Well what I mean is	Kelly and Jackie have something else that like goes with this like	sd	1
Kelly and Jackie have something else that like goes with this like	Well we would call this dark green one and the reds one third and  the light green one half and we thought the we thought one third  was bigger by one of these white things	sd	5
Well we would call this dark green one and the reds one third and  the light green one half and we thought the we thought one third  was bigger by one of these white things	Oh I think they re making a different size candy bar	sd	4
Oh I think they re making a different size candy bar	Because if say you give someone half of this one	sd	5
Because if say you give someone half of this one	and then  one half of that one	sd	5
and then  one half of that one	and this is bigger than	sd	5
and this is bigger than	The dark green	sd	4
The dark green	Yeah	sd	1
Yeah	Okay we think that a half is bigger than the third	sd	4
Okay we think that a half is bigger than the third	Yeah and we think light green is a half	sd	4
Yeah and we think light green is a half	Okay this is this is a half  and the red is a third	sd	4
Okay this is this is a half  and the red is a third	Because if you put these all together they equal up to the  one  and we think the light green which is a half is  bigger than the red by by one which is this white one	sd	5
Because if you put these all together they equal up to the  one  and we think the light green which is a half is  bigger than the red by by one which is this white one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah the green the light green is one bigger than the red	sd	4
Yeah the green the light green is one bigger than the red	And the  red is one bigger the light green is one bigger	sd	4
And the  red is one bigger the light green is one bigger	Actually I used this to um to tell that the light green is one white  bigger	sd	2
Actually I used this to um to tell that the light green is one white  bigger	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
No	I think I know what they mean	sd	2
I think I know what they mean	I think they mean that they want to call this  the dark green one one whole and they want to call this yeah like  you line all the whites up to it which I think should be six and they  want to call it one sixth	sd	2
I think they mean that they want to call this  the dark green one one whole and they want to call this yeah like  you line all the whites up to it which I think should be six and they  want to call it one sixth	I think that s what they re trying to say but  they just they re just not saying it	sd	2
I think that s what they re trying to say but  they just they re just not saying it	I think they just they want to  call it one sixth	sd	2
I think they just they want to  call it one sixth	Well however many are up there that what they are trying to say	sd	2
Well however many are up there that what they are trying to say	Yeah because I think they meant	sd	2
Yeah because I think they meant	I think you meant to say not one whole but one sixth	sv	2
I think you meant to say not one whole but one sixth	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Um one one sixth	sd	4
Um one one sixth	One sixth	sd	4
One sixth	Yea	b	1
Yea	Because that s be um the dark green	sd	5
Because that s be um the dark green	But I think you can call it one because you can make the dark green  bigger	sd	5
But I think you can call it one because you can make the dark green  bigger	You could call you can call the dark green one six the  dark green rod six and then you could call the light green rod three	sd	4
You could call you can call the dark green one six the  dark green rod six and then you could call the light green rod three	No	sd	1
Michael	Well I think I would call the yellow  twenty  five  because twenty five plus twenty five  equals fifty	sd	5
Umm why didnt you say ten plus ten plus  ten plus ten plus ten equals fifty	Because it takes two yellow rods to equal one  orange rod	sd	5
Beth	Umm me and Sarah thought first we  thought itd be umm twenty and thirty but  we knew we couldnt do that because they were exactly the same size the  yellows	sd	5
Umm me and Sarah thought first we  thought itd be umm twenty and thirty but  we knew we couldnt do that because they were exactly the same size the  yellows	So then we started thinking in cents  and we thought of two quarters equal umm  fifty and so one twenty five and twenty five  equals fifty	sd	5
What number would I give to one  white rod if were still calling the orange the  number name  fifty	Five ten fifteen twenty     Oh	sd	4
Okay I want to hear now take a little time  think about it and talk to your partners	We would call these little ones five  ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty  five forty and then fifty	sd	5
We would call these little ones five  ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty  five forty and then fifty	And you get fifty out of ten	sd	5
How did you come up  with it so quickly	I did	sd	1
Why didnt you start counting by  twos or tens	Because	sd	1
Because	Tens because tens would only  need five	sd	5
Tens because tens would only  need five	So it would be ten twenty thirty  forty fifty	sd	5
So it would be ten twenty thirty  forty fifty	So for tens it would be five	sd	5
So for tens it would be five	And  then for twos  two four six eight ten and it  would go on and be more than ten	sd	5
And five just popped into your head as being  the right one	Yeah	b	1
Let me hear  what some other people are saying	I think it is five because cause five times ten  equals fifty	sd	5
What do you think	I think that its five too	sv	2
You think five works	Yes	b	1
Thats what Im  wondering	Ha ha  we know out multiplication  tables	sd	4
Do you  really feel you could convince people that we  would be calling the white rod the number  name  five	Uh huh	b	1
Here let me come  over and see then next	You count by fives	sd	4
You count by fives	Five ten fifteen  twenty twenty five thirty thirty five forty  forty five fifty	sd	4
Im asking people that  around here	Well we tried like we just though umm  like  well we tried umm twos and that  didnt work	sd	4
Well we tried like we just though umm  like  well we tried umm twos and that  didnt work	So then we just thought five	sd	4
And it worked	Yeah	b	1
Brian lets hear what you have  here	I got the answer but I dont know how to say  it  explain it really	sd	1
Its a good chance  to practice talking to me	Well I just found out five I dont know I  cant find out why	sd	5
Well I just found out five I dont know I  cant find out why	I think well five times  ten equals fifty so	sd	5
Thats interesting	Well well because there are ten of them here and  hm Im not sure Im not  sure	sd	5
Well well because there are ten of them here and  hm Im not sure Im not  sure	Before I said one fiftieth but I think  Dave explained something to me and I  thought I guess I just thought it was right	sd	5
Before I said one fiftieth but I think  Dave explained something to me and I  thought I guess I just thought it was right	But I guess Ill just go with one fiftieth	sd	5
Youre going to go with that	Yeah one fiftieth	sd	4
One fiftieth	Yeah but Im not that sure	sd	1
It just seems like a good name to call it  because youre calling this fifty	Yeah	b	1
Is that what youre thinking	Yeah and if there are fifty of them in there I  guess I just call it one fiftieth	sd	5
Fifty of these here	Well no but but if were calling this fifty and there are each one in there  then its pretty much called a  fiftieth I guess	sd	5
Hmm ok so thats the number name youve  given it	Yeah	b	1
Please everybody listen to this and see if this  is an argument thats like yours because if  yours is different you know Id like to hear  it	If we call the white cube five then it would  equal up to fifty	sd	5
Ok lets hear their argument  maybe this will convince us one way or  another that this works	If you count by fives to fifty youll have ten  youll count youll have ten you have to have  five ten times to get to fifty	sd	5
If you count by fives to fifty youll have ten  youll count youll have ten you have to have  five ten times to get to fifty	And then um	sd	1
That it  brought them up to fifty when they counted  each of those as a five those white ones	Well I did it sort of equivalent	sd	5
Well I did it sort of equivalent	I did five  times ten equals fifty	sd	5
Ok why did you why  did you decide to do that to use a  multiplication problem to help you	Because this is a ten rod	sd	5
Because this is a ten rod	It  has ten ones	sd	5
It  has ten ones	Ten times five equals fifty	sd	5
Ten times five equals fifty	So I  said ten times what gives you fifty	sd	5
So I  said ten times what gives you fifty	And five  gives you ten times five equals fifty	sd	5
Task 1 is 15  210	It says is one fifth equal to two tenths	sd	1
What do  you remember about that Meredith	Um	sd	1
You want to tell us	We had used our Cuisenaire Rods	sd	1
Because Dr Davis also wasn t here	Say this is called one	sd	5
Say this is called one	Then you   took this	sv	5
Then you   took this	This would be half of  the orange rod    and this would be um	sd	5
This would be half of  the orange rod    and this would be um	called the one   and these would be  one  and these would be called the two  halves	sd	5
Ok so what name would you give the yellow rod	A half	sd	4
Ok	And this would be called one	sd	4
Is one fifth equal to two tenths	Um	b	1
Um	Two tenths	sd	4
Two tenths	You call this two tenth	sd	4
You call this two tenth	This is usually a tenth   and then you put this  up and you call this two tenth  and then you take this and you put it  up to them   and it s  five they equal up to it	sd	5
But maybe if you can tell the class what your thinking let s  see what they think	Well if you have the orange rod and you put it up to the yellow rod  the yellow rods it s two halves and that would be called two tenths	sd	5
Well if you have the orange rod and you put it up to the yellow rod  the yellow rods it s two halves and that would be called two tenths	Uh yeah	b	1
Uh yeah	Two tenths  wait two tenths would be	sd	5
Two tenths  wait two tenths would be	two ones     That is what two tenths  would be  because these ones are tenths	sd	5
Why don t you tell the class and	These ones are tenths   cause this orange  rod is one and when you put the ones up to it there s ten of them and  two of them would equal two tenths	sd	5
These ones are tenths   cause this orange  rod is one and when you put the ones up to it there s ten of them and  two of them would equal two tenths	And this  is one fifth to the orange rod	sd	5
And this  is one fifth to the orange rod	And if you take one of them  it s equal to two tenths	sd	5
So what is your conclusion if I ask you the question is two tenths  equal to one fifth	Yes	b	1
Do you agree or are you not sure	I agree	aa	2
Ok you want to explain why you agree	Well I agree because it s just like having one of these reds being a  whole and one of these  being a half	sd	5
Well I agree because it s just like having one of these reds being a  whole and one of these  being a half	So it s just like  saying it s just like saying two halves equal a whole	sd	5
So it s just like  saying it s just like saying two halves equal a whole	It s the same  as being two tenths equal one fifth	sd	5
Erik do you want to do  you want to say what you think out to Brian	Well I kind of agree with Meredith because if you take the orange  rod it takes ten of the white rods to equal up to the orange and five  of the red ones	sd	5
Well I kind of agree with Meredith because if you take the orange  rod it takes ten of the white rods to equal up to the orange and five  of the red ones	Then if you take two of these   which is two tenths and this  is one fifth	sd	5
Then if you take two of these   which is two tenths and this  is one fifth	Because well it s  it takes five of them to equal up to the orange rod and and if you put  two tenths next to it they equal up to each other and you ll have one  fifth and one tenth and two tenths together and they both equal up to  the same amount	sd	5
Because well it s  it takes five of them to equal up to the orange rod and and if you put  two tenths next to it they equal up to each other and you ll have one  fifth and one tenth and two tenths together and they both equal up to  the same amount	Like what I said kind of	sd	2
We were trying to figure out what  sort of happens in between and just as we said these keep on going and there are  infinitely many what we are going to be learning over the next maybe six or seven years  of math that even in between zero and one there are also infinitely many numbers	There are	sd	1
Yeah	Infinitely many	sd	1
Mathematicians claim that between zero and one there are also infinitely many  numbers	Infinitely between zero and one	sd	1
I  use to when my son was your age he use to think about those things	In fractions or just	sd	3
In fractions or just	One million	sd	4
I dont expect you to solve  that problem in your mind right now mathematicians have worked on this for centuries	I just dont understand how there can be infinitely many numbers between zero to one	sd	3
I just dont understand how there can be infinitely many numbers between zero to one	Fractions  fractions	aa	2
Fractions  fractions	I know why	b	1
I know why	No infinitely many numbers from zero to one	sd	2
No infinitely many numbers from zero to one	It doesnt	sd	1
It doesnt	Make sense	sd	1
Make sense	You can divide that line into the smallest of fractions	sd	4
You can divide that line into the smallest of fractions	You could divide it into zillionths	sd	4
You could divide it into zillionths	Yeah	b	2
You want to say that  one more time Alan	You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	sd	4
You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	If you had the longest number line in the world	sd	2
If you had the longest number line in the world	If you divide it into zillionths depending on what number you want to hold it to	sd	2
Michael Im talking about this little piece between zero and one	Yeah but you could still divide it	sd	4
Yeah but you could still divide it	But if you made a number line to show zillionths then you would have to have the longest  number line in the world	sd	5
But if you made a number line to show zillionths then you would have to have the longest  number line in the world	That doesnt make sense	aa	2
That doesnt make sense	Yes it does	sd	2
Yes it does	Even if you were to divide it into zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	sd	2
Even if you were to divide it into zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	If  you one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	sd	5
If  you one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	Well from zero to one you could	sd	2
Well from zero to one you could	You could divide it into zillionths	sd	4
You could divide it into zillionths	If you one whole is ten how could you divide it into zillionths	sd	3
Erik what if you one whole is a zillion	Then you could divide it into zillionths	sd	4
Well I think that is what I think Alan is saying	I know but Im just	sd	1
What if your one whole you called a google	A google	sd	1
A google	What if you called the zero to one a billion	sd	4
What do you think Alan	Well as I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust  particle and you could put that on there a zillion times	sd	5
Well as I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust  particle and you could put that on there a zillion times	You would have zillionths	sd	5
You would have zillionths	If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	sd	2
If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	Something that is smaller than a dust particle   a dust bug   a hundred dust bug can fit  into a dust particle	sd	2
Something that is smaller than a dust particle   a dust bug   a hundred dust bug can fit  into a dust particle	I wasnt talking about insects	sd	4
Andrew	Well if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put  your number line under it you would see that you have a lot of room left to put the one hundredth onethousandth and the onemillionth	sd	5
Did you all hear what Andrew said	Yes	b	1
Yes	If you did put it under a microscope it would look like you had enough room to put  another zero to one in there	sd	5
If you did put it under a microscope it would look like you had enough room to put  another zero to one in there	It would look like that	sd	5
It would look like that	You could have it enlarged so that the  line from the zero would be this big	sd	5
You could have it enlarged so that the  line from the zero would be this big	And you would still have room there to put more	sd	5
What happens when scientists discover more and more powerful telescopes	Than the more numbers you could fit onto one number line	sd	4
What did they find	More stars	sd	4
So they invented more powerful instruments and what did they find	More stars	sd	4
So is it that the stars arent there or is it that we dont have the instrument	We dont have the instrument	sd	4
Like Andrews example		b	1
	Space	sd	4
Space	If we could make more powerful microscopes then we would see more space every time  we looked through a different one	sd	5
Brian	So like what Alan said you can put zillionths in	sd	2
So you are sort of  agreeing that there are lots and lots of fractions between zero and one if you had this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Even like you could even make it smaller than that and make smaller pieces to put in  there	sd	4
Even like you could even make it smaller than that and make smaller pieces to put in  there	What I dont understand is that if you are using a microscope to get more space in actual  reality you are not getting more space	sd	4
That is an interesting idea isnt it Erik	You see when you are using the microscope it looks like you are getting more space but  in actuality youre not getting any more It just looks like it but you are not	sd	4
What do you have to say about it	Well actually you are because the human eye cant see that but	sd	2
Well actually you are because the human eye cant see that but	When you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and  the zero	sd	2
When you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and  the zero	Yeah but Alan what you were saying before you were saying that when you use the  microscope you get more space in that number line	sd	2
Yeah but Alan what you were saying before you were saying that when you use the  microscope you get more space in that number line	That is what you were saying before	sd	2
That is what you were saying before	No	b	2
No	Thats not what I was saying	sd	2
Thats not what I was saying	From what I understood you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more  space on the number line	sd	2
From what I understood you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more  space on the number line	It is not true	sd	2
It is not true	What I mean is look if you had some really small pen if they comeup with it you could  draw a small line in the space you but you dont really know how much space you have  left between the zillionth and the zero	sd	5
What I mean is look if you had some really small pen if they comeup with it you could  draw a small line in the space you but you dont really know how much space you have  left between the zillionth and the zero	You dont really know that because you cant see it  so you look at it under a microscope you could see how much space you have left	sv	5
Yeah it might be Erik when you were thinking more space you were thinking of extending  it	Yeah the first time the way he said it thats why	sd	2
Both of  you had a different picture in your heads about the kind of space and you were kind of  talking about the picture in your head and Alan was talking about the picture in his head  and I think Andrews picture matches Alans picture and Jessicas picture but Im not sure	Like what Im saying if you looked at it under a microscope	sd	4
Like what Im saying if you looked at it under a microscope	Like the human eye	sd	2
Like the human eye	Yeah like the human eye	sd	2
Yeah like the human eye	and	sd	1
and	You cant see it like a dust particle	sd	2
You cant see it like a dust particle	Like the zillionths and trillionth	sd	2
Like the zillionths and trillionth	Yeah you just have to magnify it	sd	2
Yeah you just have to magnify it	I think that you cant really see it to well but if you use a microscope then you are seeing  closer and it looks like you are seeing more but youre really not youre just looking closer  than before	sv	5
I think that you cant really see it to well but if you use a microscope then you are seeing  closer and it looks like you are seeing more but youre really not youre just looking closer  than before	Yeah because there is more space even between that	sd	2
Do you have an opinion	Are you a little bit lost	sd	2
Okay Audra	I really do agree with them because	sd	2
With whom	With Andrew and Alan because the human eye cant see it if you are making it that small  so if you put it under a microscope you really could see more	sv	5
With Andrew and Alan because the human eye cant see it if you are making it that small  so if you put it under a microscope you really could see more	It would be really tiny but you could still see it	sd	2
It would be really tiny but you could still see it	Well I think I agree with Alan and Andrew because you really cant see if there are any  little spaces but when you put it under a microscope there might be a huge space that you  could fit a lot of spaces	sd	5
Well I think I agree with Alan and Andrew because you really cant see if there are any  little spaces but when you put it under a microscope there might be a huge space that you  could fit a lot of spaces	He is not saying that it is getting bigger he is just saying that it is not going to stop	sd	2
He is not saying that it is getting bigger he is just saying that it is not going to stop	Oh it is sort of like the more you see the more space you have	sd	2
Oh it is sort of like the more you see the more space you have	Yeah	b	2
That is Michaels question what do you think	It is hard to explain	sd	2
Mark and then well hear from Jen	I think that I agree with Alan and Andrew because they are right you cant see the thing but  if you put it under a    244  Mark microscope and if it is a really powerful one you would have a huge space there	sd	5
Okay	Not sure	sd	1
Okay you are not sure about that you are going to think about it some more	Okay	b	1
David	I think that you can take the little smallest thing and then put it under a microscope and  you will have a lot more space but you dont	sd	5
I think that you can take the little smallest thing and then put it under a microscope and  you will have a lot more space but you dont	It looks like a lot more space but it really  isnt	sd	5
It looks like a lot more space but it really  isnt	You are just magnifying it	sd	5
You are just magnifying it	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So it looks like you have more space but you really dont	sd	2
So it looks like you have more space but you really dont	It looks like you have more space and humans take advantage of it and take that really big  space and mark these really really little lines on it that you really just cant see on it	sd	5
Alan	Up here	sd	1
Up here	If like this could be the zero and this could be the size of  a bar and there could be your line	sd	5
If like this could be the zero and this could be the size of  a bar and there could be your line	Now if you had the hundredths which would probably  go somewhere in here it would look say if it were right here	sd	5
Now if you had the hundredths which would probably  go somewhere in here it would look say if it were right here	And then you would have all  that space in there	sd	5
And then you would have all  that space in there	It looks like it but you really dont have that much space	sd	5
It looks like it but you really dont have that much space	Its just that  if you had it really big that is how much space you would think you could see	sv	5
So	So that means you could divide this into halves and thirds and fourths and fifths and all of that	sd	4
Thats interesting	Yeah because it looks like you got a lot of space but you only really have the tincywincy  bit of space in between there	sd	4
Yeah because it looks like you got a lot of space but you only really have the tincywincy  bit of space in between there	I mean you could take like a really small pen and you could  divide this up into all those pieces but if you look at it with your regular eye you couldnt  see that so you would have to make it bigger	sv	5
Does that make sense	Be sure Laura understands what you are  saying	sd	1
Be sure Laura understands what you are  saying	Yeah now thats their you could divide that space up into all little lines	sd	4
Yeah now thats their you could divide that space up into all little lines	Now if  you magnified those spaces and here would be the little bars y you could divide this  space up into little tiny pieces and that you could divide up into little spaces	sd	5
Do  you have a question for him	I dont really have a question	sd	1
Comment	On my paper I had a ruler that I put up to it that I was using and I think it was millimeters or  something	sd	5
On my paper I had a ruler that I put up to it that I was using and I think it was millimeters or  something	I had a ten inch number line so I just put it after one millimeter that was one  onehundredth	sd	5
So that is how you placed one onehundredth	Yeah	b	1
Okay	I have a comment about what Alan and Andrew said	sd	1
I have a comment about what Alan and Andrew said	You see humans dont have  powerful enough eyes to see where the zillionths are so there really is a lot of room but  you dont see it because the human eye is not as powerful as a microscope	sd	5
You see humans dont have  powerful enough eyes to see where the zillionths are so there really is a lot of room but  you dont see it because the human eye is not as powerful as a microscope	Oh	b	1
Oh	I get it so there is a lot of room that you cant see	sd	4
I get it so there is a lot of room that you cant see	Say in the future that you come up with this really high powered microscope you could  make that zero bar from the floor to the ceiling that would maybe let you see it being that  big	sv	5
Say in the future that you come up with this really high powered microscope you could  make that zero bar from the floor to the ceiling that would maybe let you see it being that  big	You could divide it up into such small pieces that when you took off the microscope  you wouldnt see anything it would be so tiny and so small that you couldnt see it but there  really is space there and if you magnify those really tiny pieces you could divide those up  into spaces	sd	5
You could divide it up into such small pieces that when you took off the microscope  you wouldnt see anything it would be so tiny and so small that you couldnt see it but there  really is space there and if you magnify those really tiny pieces you could divide those up  into spaces	Then you would probably need something with a really small point to write that small	sd	2
You are so quite back there James Amy and Jakki what are you thinking  through all this discussion	It really does make sense that there is more space in between the zillionths etc	sd	4
It really does make sense that there is more space in between the zillionths etc	etc	aa	1
etc	So I  agree with Alan mostly	sd	2
So I  agree with Alan mostly	The biggest number you could think of you could make one and so on you could go on  forever with this  I mean you could keep in magnifying it and magnifying it and  magnifying it dividing it magnifying it dividing it	sd	5
The biggest number you could think of you could make one and so on you could go on  forever with this  I mean you could keep in magnifying it and magnifying it and  magnifying it dividing it magnifying it dividing it	You could take the number line that has so much little space between it and if you look at  it with a very powerful microscope then you would be able to put billions in it so it doesnt  matter how big it is it could be as small as a germ and you could still put germs in it	sd	5
You could take the number line that has so much little space between it and if you look at  it with a very powerful microscope then you would be able to put billions in it so it doesnt  matter how big it is it could be as small as a germ and you could still put germs in it	I was going to say what Brain said that it could be as big as a dust bug and just	sd	2
Do you have any  editorial comments on this discussion	No	b	1
Meredith	I think what he is trying to say is that if you look at it through the microscope then there is a  lot of space but if you just look at it through the human eye then there isnt very much  space in there	sd	5

Um are there any problems you hope scientists will solve in the next few years	Cure certain diseases	sd	1
Cure certain diseases	AIDS	sd	1
Yeah I think that s right	Solar powered cars	sd	1
Solar powered cars	Yeah like solar powered cars	sd	1
Do you know the names of any scientists	Do I think the people now or famous people	sd	1
Famous people	Or people dead	sd	1
Or people dead	Thomas Edison	sd	1
Thomas Edison	Alex Graham Bell	sd	1
What did he do	He invented the phone	sd	1
Yeah	Thomas Edison	sd	1
Thomas Edison	Einstein I guess	sd	1
Einstein would probably be the first thing that would occur to me	He s a scientist	sd	1
So I mean that s the sense in which OK there are secrets  but do scientists also share this information	Sometimes	sd	1
Matt	I was wondering what does the mean anyway e equals m c squared	sd	3
Well that s interesting	How do you use that	qy	3
How do you use that	Energy equals	sd	4
Yeah that s right e stands for energy do you know what the m stands for	M c squared	aa	4
E equals m c squared	Mechanical	sd	4
Mechanical	We could look it up	sd	1
Why don t you see if you can find out and we can talk about that but I think maybe I propose not to do that today	Maybe a dictionary	sd	1
You think that might be	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
And maybe even nineteen	Yeah	b	1
Okay how did you decide there were just sixteen	Well if you got seventeen you must have  some of the patterns that you already have	sd	5
Did anybody else think that if you had seventeen  there must be another one	Yes	b	1
Yes	There must have been one	sd	4
There must have been one	Because there could be like switched around	sd	5
And why do you think they have been switched by the other  way around	It just was  there	sd	1
And did you  do that Stephanie	Yeah well we have something here that we have like a  pattern red blue red blue and then we have a pattern thats  like blue red blue red	sd	4
Can  you show me one that would be switched to be the opposites  of each other	We put blue red blue red and red blue red blue	sd	4
We put blue red blue red and red blue red blue	And all blue  and all red	sd	4
Okay these two here are these the ones you are talking  about	No these two	sd	1
No these two	This one and this one are complete opposites	sd	4
How are they totally opposite	Because this color and this color is different from this color  and this color and this color and this color and this color	sd	5
Okay were there any other patterns that you used that are opposites	2 Red and blue	sd	4
Or did you think  there might be seventeen	First we thought there might be seventeen because we made  one more that was seventeenth but when we were checking  it was the same as another that we had	sd	5
First we thought there might be seventeen because we made  one more that was seventeenth but when we were checking  it was the same as another that we had	So we gave up at  sixteen	sd	1
Could have there been nineteen	Maybe	sd	1
Oh could you find one	No	b	1
Okay so you really think that sixteen is right	Yeah	b	1
Does anybody else what an even number is and  what an odd number is	Even number is when you have two numbers that are the  same and that if you have two friends and you  have four piece of candy you can each have two	sd	5
Even number is when you have two numbers that are the  same and that if you have two friends and you  have four piece of candy you can each have two	And odd is  if you have two friends and three candies it wouldnt be  fair	sd	5
How  did you	Well you just think of patterns and like opposites so like	sd	4
So does it always happen in opposites	Well if you didnt have opposites we only have eight	sd	5
If you didnt  have opposites you would have only had eight	Yeah	b	1
Yes Daniel	Um what time are we gonna come back from computing	sd	1
Four cubed is	Sixtyfour	sd	4
So three quarters	Twelve	sd	4
Which one caused the difficulty	Twentyfive	sd	4
Four X all cubed	Yeah	b	1
So what does four cubed mean	Four by four by four	sd	4
Now anyone got any ideas as to how many chocolate chips I would have to put into my mixture so that I would end up with at least three in each cookie	Eighteen	sd	4
Do you understand	Yeah	b	1
Tim Ill help you seeing you whos away today	Renee	sd	1
Roll it properly	Sorry	b	1
Ive got it	Do we roll it we roll until each  three	sd	4
You must keep rolling until every cookie has got three chocolate chips in it	Our dice has got all these dots in it	sd	1
Any group not	Yeah	b	1
Mitch have you finished	No were unlucky	sd	1
Well go around the classroom	Um 25	sd	4
Twentyfive	Twentytwo	sd	4
Daniel	Um 36	sd	4
Um 36	Thirtysix	sd	4
Thirtysix	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Twentynine	sd	4
Twentynine	Twentyeight	sd	4
Twentyeight	Twentyfive	sd	4
Twentyfive	Twentysix	sd	4
And Tam	Thirtythree	aa	4
Do your frequency	Um we got 43	sd	4
Who had one three one one one one one one two one and one	Yeah	b	1
Josh	That the um total that the last number in the cumulative frequency table is equal to sigma F Is equal to the sigma F	sd	4
How many pieces of data do we have	Eleven	sd	4
Eleven	Fourteen	sd	2
Fourteen	Fourteen	sd	2
Okay now think of it 14 pieces of data balanced how many on each side	Seven	sd	4
Have we got any piece of data for the center	No	b	1
What are we going to have to do	Get the seven and eighth pieces of data add them together and	sd	4
If it requires a decimal certainly	Could it be you get six and eight	sd	4
How many pieces of data all together	Um 14	sd	4
Fourteen so how many on each side	Seven	sd	4
So numbers one through to	Seven	sd	4
And from	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Seven	sd	4
Four twentyeight over 14	which is approximately thirty point five seven	sd	4
Sorry	Thirty point five seven	sd	4
Anyone not	Oh I I didnt do that	sd	1
Oh I I didnt do that	I had it as a fraction three and foursevenths	sd	4
Okay the median the middle score which is the one we were talking about Alissa what was the seventh score	Um 28	sd	4
The av average of 28 and 29	Twentyeight point five	sd	4
What is the mode	The one with the highest frequency	sd	4
Okay and what is that	Twentyfive	sd	4
The five number summary what is the five number summary Tam	Um the lowest score the lower quartile the median the upper quartile and the highest score	sd	4
Would you find those please	Can we use our calculators	sd	1
Certainly yep	Im sort of stopped here	sd	1
So have we used one of those pieces of data to obtain this median	No	b	1
So how many pieces are there	What do you mean	qy	3
Well how many pieces of data did I have all together	Oh 22	b	4
How many pieces of data	Fourteen	sd	4
So how many on each side	Seven	sd	4
So the seventh and eighth piece of data is still in play	So you do one through seven	sd	4
Anybody else having trouble finding the first and third quartile	Yes	b	1
Dont forget when we are finding the median we had the full 14 pieces of data yes	Yep	b	1
Yep	Yes	b	1
Data numbers one to seven on the righthand side we moved the seventh and eighth piece of data in to find the median	Yeah	b	1
Therefore the seventh and eighth piece of data can still remain in play when we are trying to find the first and third quartile	Yeah	b	1
So how many pieces of data do I now have on the righthand side	One to seven	sd	4
Okay lets have a look please	Twentytwo	sd	4
Twentytwo	Twentyfive	sd	4
Median	Twentyeight point five	sd	4
Upper quartile	Thirtysix	sd	4
Now is your scale is your scale going to start at zero	No	b	1
Low score of 22 high score of 43	Twentyone	sd	4
Miles	Um so you said just then we we could start from 10 and end at say 43	sd	4
Yes	Or or we could start at one or end at 50 if we wanted	sd	4
You could but think of all that wasted scale and how long that scale is gonna be on your pad so that you can then fit	So it would be better from about 20 to 45	sd	4
Yes	Okay	b	1
Yep	Um when you when youre doing the bottom line thing do you put it like 36 twice and 25 three times on the scale d or do you just put it once	sd	4
No your scale is just going to indicate those individual scores isnt it	All right	aa	1
So you start What what range are you looking at	Um	b	1
Whats the range that youre going to show on your scale	Twentyone	sd	4
So you start at 21 21 22 23 all the way up to 43	Oh okay	b	1
Yep	got to this point	sd	4
got to this point	Um do we just draw a line	sd	1
Draw in the box yeah	Yep	b	1
Yes	Why would it be better to start at 21 than 22	sd	3
Its just that you youre not going to start your actual plot right on the extremities of your scale	Okay	b	1
Dont forget once you have completed drawing your your plot then you must show those five points on that scale yes	Mr Learoyd this is this correct	sd	1
Looks all right to me	Mr Learoyd	sd	1
Yep	I dont know I dont get how to like do it how to make the box plot	sd	3
I dont know I dont get how to like do it how to make the box plot	Do you put down here one to 24	sd	4
Now youve gotta On your plot youre going to have to show those five numbers yes	Yeah	b	1
So you might just start at 20 and go up to 45	Oh so it doesnt have to be  22	sd	4
Rather than have your plot start on the extremity of your scale and finish on the extremity of your scale you could have a little bit each side	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	23 24 25	sd	4
Because its going to be very difficult with a scale like that to actually determine what the exact median for example is	So thats not right here	sd	4
So thats not right here	So thats not right	sd	4
Yes thats right but you now have to show what scale the scale that you used on the actual line there dont you	Yeah	b	1
Where did you start	On this	sd	1
Did you start at 22	Yep 22	aa	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Okay	Um so we dont put we dont put the um  the the five points	sd	4
Thats correct	Okay	b	1
Yep	Okay	b	1
What is this point here	Twentyfive	sd	4
This point here	Thirtysix	sd	4
What was that point there	Twentyeight point five	sd	4
This one	Thirtysix	sd	4
Now there is no doubt what each of those points is	Yes	b	1
Yes	Mm hm	sd	2
Yes	If you just told them the range wouldnt they be able to determine all of the other values	sd	4
Sorry say that again	If you just told them the range wouldnt they be able to figure out the other values	sd	4
Well what is the range	Um	sd	1
Beg your pardon	Oh no I think I missed that one	sd	4
High score minus low score so what is the range	Twentyone	sd	4
Yes	Is this right	aa	1
That looks good	All right	aa	1
Here Josh	Yes please	sd	1
Where have you indicated the exact value of that point	Oh so we have to write it in	sd	1
So that is twentyeight point five thats it	Is this right Mr Learoyd	sd	1
Take the cover off your calculator	Can we clear all the stuff in it	sd	1
Everyone at that stage	Yes	b	1
Everyone got that screen	Yeah	b	1
And just before we go on there How many chocolate chips do you think you would need to ensure that you ended up with three	Twelve million of em	sd	1
Twelve million of em	At least 40	sd	4
At least	Theres no way you could tell because if all the cookies all of the chips	sd	2
But using using the information that we gathered from that little thing	Twentynine	sd	4
Twentynine	About 30	sd	4
So where are you getting these figures from	From the mean	sd	4
From the mean	The mean	sd	2
So you are electing in this case to use the mean	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Yep	Cause thats on an average of um all of the things	sd	5
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Cause its the largest number  get	sd	5
And you were looking at ensuring that every cookie had three chocolate chips in it	You make a separate batch for each one for each cookie	sd	4
Youre joking	Mix up mix up the	sd	4
Mix up mix up the	Well thats thats a way to ensure it	ba	2
Well thats thats a way to ensure it	Mix up the pan mix up the the um dough	sd	2
Yeah	Put it on the pan and then put three things in each one	sd	4
Oh I see	Yeah	b	1
Theres no fellow sitting there poking in the same number of uh chips is there	Ha ha ha	aa	1
And they would have some quality control and quantity control to ensure that there are a minimum number of chocolate chips	They base it on weight	sd	4
They base it on weight	They what they do is they say each cookie say weigh weighs um say X number of grams	sd	2
Yeah	If they if its under then well what they do is they just mix it up so that even if its a different size or shape it still weighs the same	sd	5
So are you telling me that they weigh every cookie	Yep	b	1
Yep	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	After	sd	1
I doubt it	Well thats what they do thats what they	sd	4
Well thats what they do thats what they	My my dad says they do	sd	2
Yeah	And hes a quality manufacturer	sd	1
What where they make these chocolate chip cookies	Yeah	b	1
Is he	No he does different companies	sd	1
Okay	But hes done it for	sd	1
I guess the thirty point five seven which youd take is th uh 30 or 31 would be the number that youd pick	Yeah	b	1
There were there were a couple of scores there like the 42 and the 43 that mentioned who got the 42	We did	sd	1
Okay	We got	sd	1
Have a nice weekend people	Do you want these or	sd	1
Bring those sheets back in on Monday please	We have to bring them in	sd	1
Yeah bring them back and well just continue with that	So we can get to check them with a calculator	sd	1
Michael	Sorry	b	1
Liam outside thank you	They found a better candidate	sd	1
So we have  a secret that we want to hear about we have a theory that  was being tested and then I know that um Andrews not  here	Yes he is but	sd	1
Michael	Um if you know what youre doing and you know what  strategy you could probably build you could probably  build one for every single rod	sd	4
What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what  you mean by that	You could you could build a thing you could build  fractions of every single rod if you know what youre doing  and you have a strategy or a secret that that you know will  work	sv	4
What can be such a secret	Thats what I was trying to figure out	sd	1
How many do you think	Well we got six	sd	4
You think thats it	No	sd	1
What do you think	Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you  divided the white rod maybe you could make more models  that way if you divided the white rods	sd	5
So youre thinking if you had more different size rods	Yeah yeah	b	1
What  what do you think Mark	um I think  Im not that sure	sd	1
What do you  think	Um there s a smaller one	sd	4
Ok what do you think	I think its theyre right but one green and uh and a one I  think equals one purple because if you would put that to  that it would just equal one purple and put the	sd	5
Erik is suggesting  above it	Yeah	sd	1
Uh can you show us how that shows three quarters and two  thirds	Oh we dont have  We dont have thirds in there	sd	4
oh ok	We only have the half and the whole	sd	4
Graham you can come and help	I dont have fourths in my one that I made	sd	4
Ok you want to tell the class about what you have  there	Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two  thirds and three fourths and we think that three fourths is  bigger by one twelfth	sd	5
Whats one twelfth	Because um twelve whites equal up to this	sd	5
Because um twelve whites equal up to this	Let me show  here	sd	1
Are you all convinced	But didnt you say to make a smaller one	sd	1
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	But I dont think thats the smallest one	sd	4
What do you  think	Well we just put twelve whites on there and it takes one  white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple to  the three greens	sd	5
Well we just put twelve whites on there and it takes one  white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple to  the three greens	So thats why we think its one twelfth	sd	5
What do you think Erik	Smaller in sizewise	sd	1
Smaller in sizewise	Like size for the thirds the fourths  and and the whole	sd	4
Like size for the thirds the fourths  and and the whole	Smaller by size	sd	4
Brian	Well um the orange and the red	sd	4
Ok	We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller  one because every one you use equals up to an orange and a  red and the secret is that every one has three purples and  four greens	sd	5
We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller  one because every one you use equals up to an orange and a  red and the secret is that every one has three purples and  four greens	And so you cant possibly make one smaller  because you wont be able to fit it wont work because  every one you make equals up equals up to the orange and  red	sd	5
So youre telling me the six models that you made	Were the same length	sd	4
Thats very interesting	Well well we could make another model to show that	sd	4
You found different ways to show one that had the same  length as orange and red	Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact  same length as the other one	sd	4
And what did what was how did she make her train	Yeah thats what I was going to do	sd	2
Yeah thats what I was going to do	Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the  third is purple and the fourths were the dark greens were  the light greens	sd	5
Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the  third is purple and the fourths were the dark greens were  the light greens	See thats what I did I was gonna make one that was the  same exact size	sd	2
How would you convince me	Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the  part that theres no theres no other smaller	sd	5
Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the  part that theres no theres no other smaller	I think because  at their model they use the twelfth as the white ones and  theres no rod smaller than the white rod	sd	5
I think because  at their model they use the twelfth as the white ones and  theres no rod smaller than the white rod	So therefore if  you make it a rod smaller than it they cant you cant divide  it into twelfths	sd	5
Yeah	Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod  possible	sd	5
Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod  possible	Unless you made a new rod	sd	4
So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that  had that were smaller than the white rods then you could  make a smaller model Erik	Yeah	b	1
Jessica is that reasonable to you	Yeah	b	2
Are there others	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I know I just did one	sd	1
You have another one	Yeah	b	1
I would like one that uh is the next smallest	Next sma	sd	1
Brian whats your prediction	I think it would be twentyfour	sd	4
What rods	Well the next the next the next larger one will be I think  the whole will be twentyfour	sd	4
But we we call the whole one	Yeah I know but what I mean	sd	1
Yeah I know but what I mean	No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole	sd	4
What would be what would be twentyfourths	Like the there would be there would take twentyfour  white cubes to equal up to a whole	sd	4
Like the there would be there would take twentyfour  white cubes to equal up to a whole	I I also have a strategy	sd	1
Wait wait a second youre saying twentyfour white ones  would equal your train	Yeah yeah	b	1
So then what would one  white one be called in that next model do you think	One twelfth	sd	4
One twelfth	I think um	sv	1
What would that white one be called	Well its not gonna were not gonna	sd	1
Well its not gonna were not gonna	Let me see this	sd	1
Let me see this	Um one twentyfourth I think	sd	4
You think that too	Yeah Alan and I made that same model	sd	2
Yeah Alan and I made that same model	We made the  same model that was I think it was two oranges and like  one purple yeah it was two oranges and one purple and  then it had the thirds	sd	5
Is that what you had	I made that also	sd	2
Ok can you leave the other one up  there maybe while youre making that	Sure we can	sd	1
James why dont you make the other one too so it doesnt  go away on the bottom	Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	sd	1
Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	2 more no  6 more	sd	4
I would suggest you to make both models in your  seats and keep them in front of you	Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twenty four twentyfour here	sd	5
Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twenty four twentyfour here	Youve got twentyfour plus twenty four is fortyeight	sd	5
Youve got twentyfour plus twenty four is fortyeight	I need those	sd	1
I need those	I need another red	sd	4
I need another red	I need thirtysix whites	sd	4
I need thirtysix whites	Thirtysix	sd	1
Thirtysix	Why are you saying thirtysix	sd	3
Why are you saying thirtysix	I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	sd	1
I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	You can have all the reds you want	sd	1
You can have all the reds you want	Im going to sit here  and watch you guys	sd	1
Im going to sit here  and watch you guys	Were in battle	sd	1
I see that you built a model that has two oranges  and a purple that youre calling one	Well I imagine the white ones	sd	4
And youre imagining the whites and how many do you  imagine are there	Twentyfour	sd	4
And how many do you have there Andrew	Um twentyfour whites	sd	4
But you  built it too Amy how many do you have Amy	Twentyfour	sd	4
Yes	Twentyfour	sd	4
Because if youre not you  may want to go up and count them to be sure or go to  someone else who built the model and count them	I I built the model	sd	1
Ok so Sarah and Beth you built one you dont have  enough	No	b	1
Ok do you  believe there are  Sarah and Beth	Yeah	b	2
That hes now going to give the white one the number  name what class	One twentyfourth	sd	4
We know the white  one has number name one twentyfourth in that model	Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the  thirds	sd	4
Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the  thirds	Yes mmm hmmm	sd	2
Yes mmm hmmm	And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths  would do it	sd	4
And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths  would do it	mmm hmmm	sd	2
mmm hmmm	So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is  two whites and then people think the twelfths would be the  answer but if you take two of the twentyfourths	sd	5
So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is  two whites and then people think the twelfths would be the  answer but if you take two of the twentyfourths	It would equal up to a red rod	sd	2
It would equal up to a red rod	It would equal up to a red rod	sd	2
It would equal up to a red rod	Which would be equal to twelfths	sd	2
Which would be equal to twelfths	Which would be one twelfth	sd	2
Which would be one twelfth	So see we think I think that  the answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	sd	4
So see we think I think that  the answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	Mmm hmmm	sd	2
How many of you agree with what they said	So there are two answers	sd	4
So there are two answers	Both the same	sd	4
I remember then some people had  written  do you have a question Amy	No I just want to say something	sd	1
Ok	Um that but two reds equal up to a purple	sd	4
Um that but two reds equal up to a purple	So you could put six purples down to make	sd	4
So you could put six purples down to make	What do you mean six purples	qy	3
What do you mean six purples	Becau six purples because look	sd	1
Becau six purples because look	Ok but why would you need the purples	sd	3
Ok but why would you need the purples	Why would we need the purple	sd	3
Why would we need the purple	Its only one twelfth	sd	4
Its only one twelfth	I know but you could also do it that way	sd	4
I know but you could also do it that way	You could also  put six	sd	4
You could also  put six	Why would we need that	sd	3
Why would we need that	We only need one twelfth	sd	4
We only need one twelfth	Its either two twentyfourths or  one twelfth	sd	4
Its either two twentyfourths or  one twelfth	Theyre both the same answer	sd	2
Theyre both the same answer	Theyre both the same answer	sd	2
Theyre both the same answer	I know	aa	2
I know	But why would we need the purple	sd	3
But why would we need the purple	The purple would be  too big	sd	4
The purple would be  too big	Six purples equal up to the whole train you made	sd	4
Six purples equal up to the whole train you made	But why do we need  we dont need sixths	sd	4
But why do we need  we dont need sixths	We only need  thirds and fourths	sd	4
We only need  thirds and fourths	Yeah why would we need that	sd	3
Yeah why would we need that	And twelfths and twentyfourths	sd	4
And twelfths and twentyfourths	Thats all we need	sd	4
Thats all we need	Ok	sd	1
Ok	I dont think we need sixths	sd	4
But thats an  interesting thought that there is another way and when you  think about all those purples there what number name  would you give to a purple then	One sixth	sd	4
Which almost suggests I could ask  you another problem	Which is if you asked another Which is Which is if you  asked a question with a sixth then you	sd	4
Which is if you asked another Which is Which is if you  asked a question with a sixth then you	Then you do it	sd	2
Then you do it	Then you could do it	sd	2
Dont do that now	Then then you do a sixth	sd	4
Dont do that now but I could ask you that question  couldnt I which is bigger a sixth or three quarter	Yeah	b	1
Thats what you told me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	sd	4
And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	Twentyfourths	sd	2
Twentyfourths	Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and  um	sd	2
Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and  um	Just like the one up there	sd	2
Just like the one up there	Yeah	b	2
So youre saying that if I had an orange a blue and a black  that the model should look like the one up here	Just about	sd	4
See what happens	But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	sd	1
But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	sd	4
Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites  couldnt be twentyfourths	sd	2
Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites  couldnt be twentyfourths	Right it would either take one	sd	2
Andrew and Jessica what do  you think	Well I made a  model that had the white was one fortyeighth and the  purples were twelfths and the white was I mean the red was  twentyfourths and I took two browns as the thirds and two  dark greens as the fourths and they I called them the fourths  and then the whole was four oranges and two purples	sd	5
Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns  to be	One like one one third	sd	4
One like one one third	Yeah	b	2
One brown was one third two browns was two thirds	No	b	1
Is that what youre telling me	No	b	1
No	Two browns was one third	sd	4
Two browns was one third	Two browns was one third	sd	2
Two browns was one third	I took two browns and put them together	sd	4
Two browns to be one third	Yeah	b	1
Ok lets see what theyre doing  here because um it looks to me as if you need a bunch of  rods to do this	It might not be enough	sd	4
I think can you see Alan and Erik	Not really	sd	1
Ok if youve seen what theyre building and  you think you understand how they built their model then if  you can sit down and then Id like another group to come up  and see	And what we did is this  was our whole and this was like these like um two  two browns equal  one third like we counted two as one	sd	5
And what we did is this  was our whole and this was like these like um two  two browns equal  one third like we counted two as one	And those were our  thirds and two greens was one and one two three four so  those were our fourths and	sd	5
And those were our  thirds and two greens was one and one two three four so  those were our fourths and	Purples were the	sd	2
Purples were the	Purples were the twelfths and the reds were the	sd	2
Purples were the twelfths and the reds were the	Twentyfourths	sd	2
Twentyfourths	And the white ones were fortyeighths	sd	2
Um some of you can come around while we can hear  Andrew and Jessica  would you mind doing this a couple  of times	Yeah	b	1
Some of you can come behind the table I  think	So what we did was we um	sd	1
Ok just a second lets wait till as many people uh can	We had the um whole was four oranges and two purples  and then we our strategy was we took two browns and we  put em together and they were the third	sd	5
We had the um whole was four oranges and two purples  and then we our strategy was we took two browns and we  put em together and they were the third	And then we took  two dark greens and put them together and they were the  fourths	sd	5
And then we took  two dark greens and put them together and they were the  fourths	And then the purple was the twelfth	sd	5
And then the purple was the twelfth	Twentytwelfth	sd	2
Twentytwelfth	And the red was the twentyfourth and the white was the  fortyeighth	sd	4
And the red was the twentyfourth and the white was the  fortyeighth	Fortyeighths	sd	2
Fortyeighths	And	sd	1
And	Cuz what we did really to figure it out	sd	1
Well whats the difference	The difference is one twelfth	sd	4
Can you show us	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Ok we dont have enough well just take them over here	sd	1
Ok we dont have enough well just take them over here	Two thirds thats all we need and then	sd	4
Two thirds thats all we need and then	So um do we need anything	sd	1
So um do we need anything	Here we need brown	sd	4
Here we need brown	We need some of those	sd	4
We need some of those	Ok well we came up with the conclusion of that	sd	1
Ok well we came up with the conclusion of that	That two thirds	sd	4
That two thirds	That two thirds  that four three fourths  were  bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	sd	4
That two thirds  that four three fourths  were  bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	By one twelfth	sd	2
By one twelfth	Or two twentyfourths	sd	2
Or two twentyfourths	Or	b	1
Or	Or four fortyeighths	sd	4
Hold on a  minute Jessica I think were having a little discussion  about uh solutions there Ok can you nice and loud for the  people back there show them what youre doing	Well what we did was we made a model and we counted  um	sd	4
Well what we did was we made a model and we counted  um	four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our  thirds we counted we counted two oranges as one I mean  two browns as one	sd	5
four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our  thirds we counted we counted two oranges as one I mean  two browns as one	And we had	sd	1
And we had	that was our third	sd	4
that was our third	That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two  greens as one  two  dark greens as one	sd	5
That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two  greens as one  two  dark greens as one	Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were forty eights	sd	5
Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were forty eights	Fortyeighths	sd	2
Fortyeighths	And we think that we think that three um  fourths are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I  mean four fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	sd	5
And we think that we think that three um  fourths are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I  mean four fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	No two twentyfourths	sd	2
No two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourth or whats that	sd	3
Two twentyfourth or whats that	One twelfth	sd	4
What do you think about that Michael	I guess I agree with it its what I came up with	sd	2
You came up with the same model didnt you	Yeah	b	2
Meredith and David and Erik and Alan  does this model  have anything to do with the theory you tested David	Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one  fortyeighth	sd	4
Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one  fortyeighth	And and the	sd	1
And and the	And then the reds would be um one	sd	4
And then the reds would be um one	Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought  that the light greens would be well David thought that the  light greens would be twelfths but then we tried it and they  would become the sixteenths so then we tried the purple  yeah the sixteenths and we tried the purple and then that  was the twelfths	sd	5
Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought  that the light greens would be well David thought that the  light greens would be twelfths but then we tried it and they  would become the sixteenths so then we tried the purple  yeah the sixteenths and we tried the purple and then that  was the twelfths	Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	sd	2
Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	So in other words we doubled everything	sd	2
So in other words we doubled everything	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	You basically just added like there originally were  just two oranges now there are four oranges and an extra  purple	sd	5
You basically just added like there originally were  just two oranges now there are four oranges and an extra  purple	Now there are six there are six browns	sd	5
All of these represent one is that a surprise	It could have been two purples changing into a brown	sd	4
It could have been two purples changing into a brown	Yeah	b	1
Thats true	And	sd	1
You see this one  here you called the orange and red one isnt that right and  here you called one two orange and purple right	So basically its just doubled	sd	4
So basically its just doubled	Thats	ba	1
In what way is it doubled	Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and  two purples or a brown so	sd	5
But the first one doesnt have any purples	Well thats because this had nothing to do with the first  problem because of the first question but	sv	5
Im not sure I understand what youre saying	Had there have been sixths	sd	4
Had there have been sixths	I know	aa	1
We didnt have sixths we had twelfths here	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Mmm hmm	I think I know what hes saying	sd	1
I think I know what hes saying	Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are  fortyeighths this time	sd	5
Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are  fortyeighths this time	Now up there there are no purples  because they werent  put on	sd	5
Now up there there are no purples  because they werent  put on	But had they have been on the  bottom which they are they are twelfths because	sd	5
But had they have been on the  bottom which they are they are twelfths because	Purples	sd	1
Purples	In that	sd	1
In that	Purples are twelfths	sd	4
Purples are twelfths	In that model they became twelfths but over there they  would be the sixths	sd	2
In that model they became twelfths but over there they  would be the sixths	Like Amy said if	sd	1
Like Amy said if	Right because if you double each of them it would come  out to twice the number	sd	5
Right because if you double each of them it would come  out to twice the number	Exactly	aa	2
James	Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and  two purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the  reds there its two reds make a purple and that that means  the two oranges and the red make two oranges and a purple	sd	5
Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and  two purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the  reds there its two reds make a purple and that that means  the two oranges and the red make two oranges and a purple	Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model  and a purple and then two more oranges and a purple and  you put them on top of each other theyd be equal	sd	5
Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model  and a purple and then two more oranges and a purple and  you put them on top of each other theyd be equal	But if  you put em side to side youd have four oranges and two  purples or the two purples could be a brown	sd	5
But if  you put em side to side youd have four oranges and two  purples or the two purples could be a brown	So its  basically doubled each of the length is doubled	sd	5
But how did the red get doubled	The red	sd	1
Im confused how did the red get doubled here	The red	sd	1
Kimberly	Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a  purple so now if they have a purple they doubled the red	sd	5
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I was going to say something different	sd	2
What  would you expect we would have then if its doubled	Um four oranges and two purples	sd	4
Or four oranges and one brown	Yep	b	1
If I were to make another  model Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question  what do you think my question is Andrew	If you were gonna make another model what um the  doubles be	sd	4
Brian	Um fortyeight	sd	4
Imagine in your head what I would  call one	Fortyeight	b	4
Fortyeight	Cuz there would be well cuz there would be  fortyeight whites equal up to one and then	sd	5
In this model	So we have to double that	sd	4
So we have to double that	But no	sd	1
I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew  what do you think	Well youre saying what	sd	1
Well youre saying what	No it cant	sd	4
No it cant	Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	sd	4
Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	It cant be done	sd	4
Eight orange rods Im listening	Eight orange rods and two browns	sd	4
Eight orange rods and two browns	And two browns	sd	2
And two brown rods	You cant double that	sd	4
You cant double that	You cant double that model because  if you did then you wouldnt be able to third it	sv	5
You cant double that model because  if you did then you wouldnt be able to third it	You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you  just train it	sd	2
You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you  just train it	Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges  and two browns now is there any rod that could third that	sd	5
Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges  and two browns now is there any rod that could third that	Well if you use a train	sd	4
Well if you use a train	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	sd	2
If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	sd	4
Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	It would probably be	sd	1
It would probably be	Up there its just plain except for the whole	sd	4
Up there its just plain except for the whole	It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and  three dark greens would be the fourths	sd	5
It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and  three dark greens would be the fourths	Right but that would be using more than one rod to make  another rod to fit fit the same thing	sd	2
Right but that would be using more than one rod to make  another rod to fit fit the same thing	Yeah so you can do that	aa	2
Yeah so you can do that	Just like you Andrew said you  can use a train to make a third and a fourth	sd	2
Just like you Andrew said you  can use a train to make a third and a fourth	Cuz he like I I  overheard they said that if you can use a train to make a  whole why cant you use it to make a third and a fourth	sd	5
Cuz he like I I  overheard they said that if you can use a train to make a  whole why cant you use it to make a third and a fourth	Yeah	b	2
David	And a half	sd	4
And a half	But then it wouldnt be equal	sd	2
But then it wouldnt be equal	Yeah they would	sd	2
Yeah they would	Cuz the third could be like in that  model Andrew used the two browns thats equal	sd	2
Cuz the third could be like in that  model Andrew used the two browns thats equal	But in that model the three browns dont have anything  attached on so its totally equal	sd	2
But in that model the three browns dont have anything  attached on so its totally equal	They just doubled it	sd	4
They just doubled it	But if you added something on	sd	2
But if you added something on	We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that  model	sd	2
We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that  model	Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	sd	2
Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	Yeah exactly	b	2
Yeah exactly	So in the next model	sd	1
Did you want to say something	Um I agree with Erik	sd	2
What part of what Erik said	Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like  Erik said that you can train it and put the other blocks onto  the other one	sd	5
Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like  Erik said that you can train it and put the other blocks onto  the other one	What I meant what I meant is you cant third it just using  one rod	sd	4
Ok Alan	Exactly	aa	1
Exactly	You cant third it using one rod but you can third  it using trains	sd	4
You cant third it using one rod but you can third  it using trains	You could double that but you would have to use two rods  to make it	sd	4
Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can  imagine  can you make one bigger than that	If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges   and sixteen oranges and four browns	sd	5
Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id  like you to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful  models you built but the question Id like you to think about  is uh is there is there a biggest model	Thirtytwo oranges	sd	4
Ok I think we have to stop Ill see you in two weeks and if  you could	I wonder how many oranges	sd	3
Some of you may be explaining Jessica s argument when you write  to us this weekend	Umm there s not enough reds for there	sd	5
Umm there s not enough reds for there	Well umm well I I have this I counted as my one whole and that  was my one half but then this my one third it s not it doesn t I have  my this is one sixth	sd	5
Well umm well I I have this I counted as my one whole and that  was my one half but then this my one third it s not it doesn t I have  my this is one sixth	This is one sixth	sd	5
This is one sixth	The red is one sixth and I and  I didn t think um one third was right now because one third is  smaller  umm one this is one third and I put that here because I  wanted to show how that this red here how it takes two reds	sd	5
The red is one sixth and I and  I didn t think um one third was right now because one third is  smaller  umm one this is one third and I put that here because I  wanted to show how that this red here how it takes two reds	Wait I  forget what I was going to say	sd	1
Wait I  forget what I was going to say	I forget all what I was going to say	sd	1
I forget all what I was going to say	I think that what you re trying to say	sv	2
I think that what you re trying to say	And then what I think  is that if you take one of the dark greens which is the half it equ it s  larger than one uh third but yet if you put another third onto the um  the um dark green I mean not to the dark green to the uh purple to  the other third that third is larger than it	sd	5
And then what I think  is that if you take one of the dark greens which is the half it equ it s  larger than one uh third but yet if you put another third onto the um  the um dark green I mean not to the dark green to the uh purple to  the other third that third is larger than it	So then If you put it like if you put one of the red rods well  it s sm like I said it s smaller the third the one third is smaller than  the one half and one of these red ones these the reds are sixths if  you put the red on top of the pink uh the purple it equals up to the  exact same size as the dark green	sd	5
So then If you put it like if you put one of the red rods well  it s sm like I said it s smaller the third the one third is smaller than  the one half and one of these red ones these the reds are sixths if  you put the red on top of the pink uh the purple it equals up to the  exact same size as the dark green	Yeah that s what I was trying to say	sd	2
OK so what if I gave you eightyfour for X	Huh	b	1
What if I gave you eightyfour for X	Lets see	sd	1
Lets see	I got that on lock down	sd	1
I got that on lock down	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	You said eightyfour right	sd	1
You said eightyfour right	Thats easy	ba	1
Thats easy	Two fifty three	sd	4
What do you think	Two fifty three for what	sd	3
Two fifty three for what	I used my rule	sd	4
I used my rule	Eightyfour	sd	4
Eightyfour	I just used my rule	sd	4
I just used my rule	Eightyfour times three is two hundred and fiftytwo  plus one is two hundred and fiftythree	sd	5
What do you think	Eightyfour	sd	1
Eightyfour	Why eightyfour	b	3
I picked up any number	Stop giving us these big numbers	sd	1
Stop giving us these big numbers	What if I give a thousand two hundred and fifty	sd	4
A thousand two hundred and fifty	I dont	sd	1

I dont want to do that	I dont want to do  that	sd	1
I dont want to do  that		sd	1
	Three thousand seven hundred and fiftyone	sd	4
My goodness what do you think about this James	What	ba	1
What	One two fifty times three is three seven fifty plus one is three seven fifty  one	sd	5
One two fifty times three is three seven fifty plus one is three seven fifty  one	I know that there is some pattern  between this one and this one	sd	5
I know that there is some pattern  between this one and this one	I  dont know how to say it	sd	1
Between which one and which one	I know twentyfive times three is seventyfive there is something out  there I just dont know how to explain it	sd	4
What about twentyfive	It is seventysix	sd	4
It is seventysix	I forgot to write down	sd	1
Alright so what are you noticing with the numbers	Huh	b	1
What are you noticing with the numbers	I just noticed that twentyfive times three is seventyfive thats how I  solved this real quick	sd	5
Do you think there is anything that is same with what you are doing and  what James came up with	Uh uh ahhh I dont know	sd	1
Uh uh ahhh I dont know	Oh wait a minute	sd	1
Oh wait a minute	Uh hmm maybe	sd	1
Uh hmm maybe	I dont  know	sd	1
I dont  know	Because Im adding three thats an odd number he is adding odd  numbers so might be the same	sd	5
So might be the same	Im doing odd and he is doing odds so    same thing	sd	5
So odd numbers are the common	Have you guys got more problems	sd	1
Okay  Danielle Gregory let s hear your thinking	Well we think that the um the half which is the brown um was  bigger than the fourth because if you take the brown the half and the  fourth you could see that the half is bigger	sd	5
How much bigger	By a purple	sd	4
And what number name is that	A fourth	sd	4
Ok lets all listen to Andrew s  um solution now and see if you agree	It s bigger by um one fourth because there and put that there	sd	5
It s bigger by um one fourth because there and put that there	I  think they re all if you have the fourths on your um your problem  and I think that it would always be one fourth would be as much as  more	sv	5
I  think they re all if you have the fourths on your um your problem  and I think that it would always be one fourth would be as much as  more	The half would be more than it by one fourth if you always  have a fourth	sd	5
Why do you think that	Well because out of all the people that came up here they always  had the room for one more fourth and I think that because usually  the fourths or two of  em are equal up to the half so then it would  be a fourths	sd	5
Erik	Well I think that we think that you could divide I think that you  could take you could take rods and divide them equally into fourths  I think six times	sv	4
Well I think that we think that you could divide I think that you  could take you could take rods and divide them equally into fourths  I think six times	Well and we also came to a theory that if if you  uh yeah we also came to a theory that	sd	1
Well and we also came to a theory that if if you  uh yeah we also came to a theory that	If you take an orange rod go down two it would be a brown rod	sd	5
If you take an orange rod go down two it would be a brown rod	if you take an orange rod and go down two it will be the brown rod	sd	5
if you take an orange rod and go down two it will be the brown rod	And you can make it into quarters and then	sd	2
And you can make it into quarters and then	Yeah you just divide two from each rod like you start with the  orange rod divide by two and then the brown rod and you divide by  two from the brown rod	sd	5
Yeah you just divide two from each rod like you start with the  orange rod divide by two and then the brown rod and you divide by  two from the brown rod	From the brown rod	sd	2
From the brown rod	And then whatever rod you get divide two from that and keep going  down	sd	2
Alan did you want to add something	We have a lot of them we need  to remember	sd	4
Will your answer change when you change your  model	Um I don t think so cause it might just be in a different size but it  might be the same thing but they kind of changed it around a little  bit	sd	5
One  two three four five six models Meredith has here	That s what we have too	sd	1
Okay what do you think Andrew	Well you really can t tell if um you can t tell if the half is bigger  than the fourth cause right on their problems that they have they  don t have a half	sd	5
Well you really can t tell if um you can t tell if the half is bigger  than the fourth cause right on their problems that they have they  don t have a half	Well we didn t do the halfs we just did the fourths	sd	5
Well we didn t do the halfs we just did the fourths	Because all you  really had to do was the fourths	sd	5
Because all you  really had to do was the fourths	Andrew  But the question was is one half bigger than a fourth by how much	sd	2
Andrew  But the question was is one half bigger than a fourth by how much	But we think before we went up we heard other people go up and  they explained that they thought one half was bigger than one third  by one fourth so we just figured that we d just do the problem just to  show and even if we had to do the fourths or the halves half of that  would be actually would probably I m not sure but we didn t really  have them because we thought that people answered the question	sd	5
But we think before we went up we heard other people go up and  they explained that they thought one half was bigger than one third  by one fourth so we just figured that we d just do the problem just to  show and even if we had to do the fourths or the halves half of that  would be actually would probably I m not sure but we didn t really  have them because we thought that people answered the question	That they d be bigger by one fourth	sd	5
You divide the number in half	Eight right	b	4
Yeah	I will take half of eight that is four	sd	5
I will take half of eight that is four	I will make a ladder with four steps I will count the rods and then I will multiply the number of rods by two and then from that answer that I got from multiplying the number of rods by two I will subtract two	sd	5
So you can do that for any number of steps	For numbers that do not have half I will take the closest number and then do half and then subtract two and then add three	sd	5
So like for nine what would be the closest number	I will go to eight	sd	4
Huh huh	I will subtract   or I can go to ten if I wanted to or what ever is easier	sd	4
Huh huh	So I will go to eight take half is four count the rods multiply by two subtract two and then add three	sd	5
Wow can you write it out	Can t I just show you	sd	1
Right	Yeah	b	1
So can you write that out then we can keep talking about that	How many numbers you are trying to get when you multiply by two	sd	3
How many numbers you are trying to get when you multiply by two	I got to leave at threethirty	sd	1
He is writing he seems to have two ways of doing about it	For odd numbers I go to the nearest even number and take 1 2 of that even number count the rods for a ladder with that many steps multiply it by two subtract two and add three	sd	5
For odd numbers I go to the nearest even number and take 1 2 of that even number count the rods for a ladder with that many steps multiply it by two subtract two and add three	Now I will show you	sd	1
Now I will show you	Say nine it is odd	sd	5
Say nine it is odd	I go to the even number eight	sd	5
I go to the even number eight	And take half of eight equals four	sd	5
And take half of eight equals four	I would make a ladder of four and then I would count  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	sd	5
I would make a ladder of four and then I would count  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	Then I multiply fourteen which is the number of rods times two because four times two equals eight gives me twenty eight and then I subtract two will give me twentysix and then I would add three	sd	5
Then I multiply fourteen which is the number of rods times two because four times two equals eight gives me twenty eight and then I subtract two will give me twentysix and then I would add three	Because for every new thingy it is three rods and it will give me twenty nine	sd	5
Because for every new thingy it is three rods and it will give me twenty nine	I am the winner	sd	1
That is for odd numbers right	Yeah	b	1
And for even numbers you want to write for even numbers	You just killed my	sd	1
You can write here	You killed my happiness	sd	1
Your handwriting is good	multiply by three to get your answer then subtract one	sd	5
multiply by three to get your answer then subtract one	For even numbers I take half of that number and make a ladder oops I messed up with that I got a lot of homework now and I got to go to Karate many steps	sd	5
For even numbers I take half of that number and make a ladder oops I messed up with that I got a lot of homework now and I got to go to Karate many steps	Then I multiply the number of rods of that ladder by two then I subtract two	sd	5
Then I multiply the number of rods of that ladder by two then I subtract two	That s it	aa	1
That s it	Here it is subtract by two	sd	5
Here it is subtract by two	Eight	sd	5

An orange and a red	And purples for thirds	sd	4
And purples for thirds	And three purples	sd	2
And three purples	And light green for fourths	sd	2
Ok right	And um here how I used to figure it out	sd	1
And um here how I used to figure it out	Twelfths	aa	4
Twelfths	Oh no those are singles	sd	4
Honestly Erik I could imagine if you explained to me what Im  supposed to imagine	Ok	b	1
Ill try real hard but I ll try to imagine	Suppose there are twelfths under that	sd	4
I can imagine that	And you took out two of those purples and three light greens	sd	4
I could imagine	It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between the  between the um um	sd	4
It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between the  between the um um	See	sd	1
See	Two thirds and three fourths	sd	4
I see that	And we came to up here	sd	4
And we came to up here	So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	sd	5
So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it would  be bigger by one twelfth or	sd	2
And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it would  be bigger by one twelfth or	Two twentyfourths	sd	4
Two twentyfourths	Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the	sd	5
Why is it a red here and why is it a white here	Well because see each model is different	sd	5
In what way	Because this model is bigger than this model	sd	5
Because this model is bigger than this model	You could put the reds on that model and make it sixths	sd	4
You could put the reds on that model and make it sixths	But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that model	sd	3
But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that model	Oh yeah youre right	aa	2
Oh yeah youre right	So either its one twelfth or one twentyfourths	sd	4
So either its one twelfth or one twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths	sd	2
Two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths on this one	sd	4
Two twentyfourths on this one	This is probably the only model that  can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd have to halve each  white to get twentyfourths there	sd	5
This is probably the only model that  can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd have to halve each  white to get twentyfourths there	But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	sd	3
But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	We tried that already	sd	2
We tried that already	No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	sd	2
You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three oranges	Well I dont know exactly but it would be a lot	sd	4
Do you still expect that you would get the same answer	Well we can divide it	sd	4
Well we can divide it	Looking at this it would not be fiftieths	sd	4
Why not	Im imagining a this  instead of the purple  there	sd	4
Instead of the purple	It would take another six of those so it would only be thirtieths	sd	5
Id like you to try that other model	Three oranges	sd	1
Id like you to find a third  model thinking big	Ok	b	1
Ok	We could think real big	sd	1

Yeah but it s legal	But it s cheap	sd	2
But it s cheap	A million a million and one	sd	2
A million a million and one	Dude one one seven too	sd	2
Dude one one seven too	A million a million and one	sd	2
A million a million and one	One one seven	sd	2

One one seven	I know  Small dippy numbers	sd	1
I know  Small dippy numbers	I got it ninetynine	sd	2
I got it ninetynine	Oh use some cheesy little	sd	1
Legal or illegal	Illegal	sd	4

	Matt Matt stop	sd	1
Matt Matt stop	Who said true	sd	2
Who said true	Matt stop it	sd	1
Uh okay so what is the next question Michelle	What is legal but true	sd	1
Yeah make a legal substitution but make it true	Four four one	sd	4
Four four one	What about two	sd	2
What about two	What about one one seven and what about two two five	sd	2
What about one one seven and what about two two five	Three three and three	sd	2
How about three three and three	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Six four and two	sd	4
Six four and two	Six four and two that s twelve	sd	2
Six four and two that s twelve	It s eleven idiot	sd	2
It s eleven idiot	Six four and two	sd	2
Be quiet so you can hear Amy Lynn	Well I think that three three and three is legal because like it s it s legal for like the two boxes and then like the triangle is a whole new shape so you can start all over again	sd	5
That is exactly correct	Go Amy	aa	1
Go Amy	Alright Amy	b	1
Alright Amy	What did you say Amy	sd	2
What did you say Amy	She said something how it s legal for some stupid reason	sd	2
Some people didn t hear	Alright The two boxes alright it s can be three it s a legal move and then the triangle it can start all over again with any number	sd	5
Alright The two boxes alright it s can be three it s a legal move and then the triangle it can start all over again with any number	It s a whole you can start all over again	sd	5
So it is legal and it s certainly true Is that alright	Zippyedydodah	sd	1
Zippyedydodah	A proctologist	sd	1
I want to show you how really there are lots of things you can do four four one	What about two two and five	sd	4
The way that people sometimes keep track of that	How about five five and minus one	sd	5
How about five five and minus one	That should work five five minus one that equals nine	sd	5
Now we wouldn t solve it today it s a very hard problem no the one that I m about to show you	Is that number 10	sd	1
Now we re certainly not going to solve that today but I ll bet you you are going to solve it in the next few weeks	Are you coming back next week	sd	1
Good heavens	When we have to multiply box times box could it be box plus box	sd	4
Could be all kinds of things	I got it	sd	1
I got it	You re the one who started it	sd	1
Are you ready to explain that to the camera	Well we have to make sure it works sixteen and sixteen is thirty two	sd	5
Well we have to make sure it works sixteen and sixteen is thirty two	It does work but sixtythree	sd	5
It does work but sixtythree	What about us	sd	1
Do you want to say it to the camera or do you want to say it to everybody	Camera	ba	1
Camera	Okay	b	1
OK here s the microphone	I explain OK	sd	1
I explain OK	Well see one is the difference between zero and one	sd	5
Well see one is the difference between zero and one	And if you add one plus one it equals two which is the difference there	sd	5
And if you add one plus one it equals two which is the difference there	And two plus two is four which is the difference between there	sd	5
And two plus two is four which is the difference between there	Four plus four is eight which is the difference between there	sd	5
Four plus four is eight which is the difference between there	And you add sixteen and sixteen which is thirty two the difference between there and so on	sd	5
And you add sixteen and sixteen which is thirty two the difference between there and so on	See the numbers you add that number with itself and you get the answer which is the difference betweenthe next numbers	sd	5
What number am I looking at here	Between zero and one is one	sd	4
So what am I going to do add that	You add one and one and you get two which is the difference between there	sd	5
Oh ah that s really clever	If you add the one and two you get three	sd	5
If you add the one and two you get three	And so on you do it for everything	sd	5
Can we talk for one second about keeping secrets	We shouldn t keep secrets	sd	1
What s the bad thing about keeping secrets	Other people wouldn t find out	sd	1
Other people wouldn t find out	If another person finds out and says it as long as you	sd	1
If another person finds out and says it as long as you	As long as you eventually tell it s all right	sd	1
As long as you eventually tell it s all right	Could you keep it for a couple weeks and see how many people die before I give it out	sd	1
I think we do need to keep thinking about it we do need to find a way to this so that everybody s comfortable with it but there is also a case to be made for keeping secrets because what I ve said sometimes to people is suppose say Michael and I went to the gym and Michael did a lot of weight lifting and I watched him who gets stronger	He would	sd	1
What s that got to do with secrets	Nothing	sd	1
Nothing	Oh you would have to do it yourself	sv	1
Oh you would have to do it yourself	He s doing the lifting	sd	1
He s doing the lifting	If you want to get stronger you got to figure it out	sd	1
Cause if you want to be good at figuring things out you better practice figuring things out	But maybe if you want to make sure of things before you do it	sd	1
So what do we got here	Were drawing	sd	1
No	We kind of stopped	sd	1
Okay why did we stop	We started doing the poster and like giving each other ideas	sd	1
Okay	And then we could label this	sd	1
And then we could label this	We could say like  what do we want to call it	sd	1
We could say like  what do we want to call it	We could call it like the invisible part	sd	1
We could call it like the invisible part	Invisible cone	sd	1
Invisible cone	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How about we say triangle	sd	1
How about we say triangle	Invisible triangle	sd	1
Invisible triangle	And we should label each of like the  so like this is W N S and  like like the lines on the side	sd	1
And we should label each of like the  so like this is W N S and  like like the lines on the side	W is here	sd	1
W is here	W	b	1
W	N	b	1
N	Oh right S	b	1
Oh right S	And like make the	sd	1
And like make the	Does it matter	sd	1
Does it matter	line centered	sd	4
line centered	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	And then this whole thing equals R You can use that if you want	sv	4
And then this whole thing equals R You can use that if you want	Thats good	ba	2
Thats good	Okay	b	1
Okay	And then say like we have this as X	sd	4
And then say like we have this as X	Or like	sd	1
Or like	The tip	sd	4
The tip	R minus S on this part	sd	4
R minus S on this part	R minus S yes	sd	2
R minus S yes	And what else do we want to put on this	sd	3
And what else do we want to put on this	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	I think thats fine	sv	1
I think thats fine	I think we should write this  this triangle is similar to that one	sv	4
I think we should write this  this triangle is similar to that one	Thats what were trying to do	sd	1
Thats what were trying to do	Like similar triangles	sd	2
Like similar triangles	Yeah so we have to label more corners	sd	1
Yeah so we have to label more corners	So	sd	1
So	Label like	sd	1
Label like	Can we do A B C D	sd	1
Can we do A B C D	A B C D	aa	1
A B C D	How do you spell dimension because I dont want to spell it wrong	sd	1
How do you spell dimension because I dont want to spell it wrong	It says it right there	sd	1
It says it right there	Oh it does	sd	1
Oh it does	I dont see oh there it goes	sd	1
I dont see oh there it goes	MEN	sd	1
MEN	All right I need to go give her the	sd	1
All right I need to go give her the	I cant read what that says	sd	1
I cant read what that says	I think it says SIO	sd	1
Im going to put a timer on for two and a half minutes	All right lets put seven	sd	4
All right lets put seven	Seven E	sd	2
Seven E	Okay were done	sd	1
Posters need to be on the board	So we need to say like this big triangle is equal to the small triangle	sd	4
So we need to say like this big triangle is equal to the small triangle	Well its similar its not	sd	2
Well its similar its not	Oh its similar yeah	aa	2
Oh its similar yeah	We can do that	sd	1
We can do that	R over W equals the  like	sd	4
R over W equals the  like	Well I think what she meant is we have to say like W is this N is this R minus S is this	sd	1
Well I think what she meant is we have to say like W is this N is this R minus S is this	Okay	b	1
Okay	So we can do that	sd	1
So we can do that	So we can say that S	sd	1
Lets see if anybody can do number 7 then	We re done with it	sd	1
Come say it for the camera here	So it s like 0 times 0  5 equals thing	sd	5
So it s like 0 times 0  5 equals thing	And you d just get that moving to like 1 times 1 2 times 2 3 times 3 and 4 times 4	sd	5
Right	So 5  6	sd	5
So 5  6	And 59	sd	5
So how would you write that with this box triangle notation	Box times Box  5  Triangle	sd	4
Can you write it for me	What way	b	3
What way	This way	sd	3
Nice	It s the same problem	sd	1
Here s your microphone	Okay	b	1
Okay	It was the same problem with the same like code as the one before	sd	5
It was the same problem with the same like code as the one before	Box times box but instead of plus 1 it s plus 5 equals the number	sd	5
Box times box but instead of plus 1 it s plus 5 equals the number	Equals triangle	sd	5
With the boxes and triangles	So it would be like box times box plus 5 equals triangle	sd	4
Thanks	It s easy	sd	1
That s very nice	Thank you	aa	1
So whats the rule for this  one	About the rule	sd	1
Hmm hmm	X you plus three and then times	sd	4
Can you show if that works for these values	I want to write down	sd	1
Yeah you can use one of that	Zero plus three is three times three is nine	sd	5
Zero plus three is three times three is nine	One plus three is four times three is twelve	sd	5
One plus three is four times three is twelve	Two plus three equals five  times three is eighteen	sd	5
What is five times three	Fifteen	sd	4
To guess the rule or you started with the rule	Yeah this is right	b	4
So this is the rule that you invented	Yeah	b	1
So is this something that they asked you yesterday or you just  thought of	I just thought of	sd	1
If you want to tell someone without  giving specific examples how would you tell what the rule is	Plus three times three	sd	4
Would you do  addition first or	X plus three	sd	4
X is the number that you start with	Yeah	b	1
OK	X plus three times three equals Y	sd	4
So if I see it written this way then you think I would do first I would  add three and then I would multiply the result by three	Yeah	b	1
What would you do	Why is it two	sd	3
Huh	Why is it two	sd	3
You say it is twentyone how did you go about it	Five plus two is seven seven times three is twentyone	sd	5
To find the answer for this expression	Twentyone	sd	5
Twentyone	Five plus two is seven times three is twentyone	sd	5
Two times three is six and that is five so I would say the answer is  eleven	Oh I know what you do	sd	1
T1 Why you put parentheses	That shows that you should do that first  before you do anything else	sv	5
That shows that you should do that first  before you do anything else	Thats what our teacher did	sd	5
T1 So you need that to avoid confusion here	You think we should put the  parentheses here	sd	1
Would you leave this rule the same way	This rule	sv	1
This is yours	He said	sd	1
Ok lets see	I would call it 112	sd	4
Ok Danielle why do you think 112	Because the red and the orange thats the  whole and 12 white ones make up the  whole	sd	5
I would like you all to think  about for a minute maybe even to discuss it  with your partner what you might call these	has told us part of this you just  have to put it into the sentence now	sd	1
has told us part of this you just  have to put it into the sentence now	6	b	1
Read me read me what it says there	How many whites are in a red and orange  train	sd	1
How many whites are in a red and orange  train	Uh twelve	sd	4
How many	How many blank are in	sd	1
What would you call one of these	A twelfth	sd	4
So how many blanks are in  You said  how many twelfths are in	A whole	sd	4
Are in one right you have it	I do	sd	1
Read the second line	How many twelfths are in a whole	sd	1
Ok wait maybe Im wrong  what did you say	How many twelfths are in one	sd	4
Ok lets  see I havent had a chance to  David	The white would be 112 and the red and  orange train would be 1 whole	sd	4
Let me hear from Graham	There is 12 twelfths	sd	4
So then youre telling me that how many  112s are in 1 is 12	Yeah	b	1
Now Erik did you have something that you  wanted to add	For that equation well you could put how  many 112s there are in 1 you can also put  how many 112s are there in 1212s	sd	4
So I could also rewrite this youre  saying then as 12 over 12	Yeah	b	1
Are  they the same thing	Yes	b	1
If you have an idea about that raise  your hand	What did he say about 112	sd	3
Id like everybody to watch what they do  because if you have a different way of thinking about it Id like  to see that also	Well we thought that if we had to find one half of that we took  two dark greens and the white one	sd	5
Well we thought that if we had to find one half of that we took  two dark greens and the white one	And we said if we split the  white one in half then it would be half because if you put the  white one there it would equal up the the train that you made	sd	5
And we said if we split the  white one in half then it would be half because if you put the  white one there it would equal up the the train that you made	Quick give me the yellow I need the yellow	sd	1
Quick give me the yellow I need the yellow	I  have a solution I have a solution	sd	1
Meredith	Well because you want to have seven and six seven but there  are no rods that are really seven and you need it to be thirteen	sd	5
Well because you want to have seven and six seven but there  are no rods that are really seven and you need it to be thirteen	So those two blocks and half of that would equal up to it and it  would help	sd	5
Okay can you say a little bit more about that	Well take the two greens and take a white	sd	4
Well take the two greens and take a white	And you do that	sv	4
Ok its just like our picture up here	And theres no blocks that have half on them and for the  uneven numbers for the odd numbers you need a half because  you cant make it without it	sd	5
Ok Brian said something like that too about the numbers being  odd	Well like what we did last time with when Mrs Maher was  talking about about if we split the gold equally what you could  do is well I thought of a lot of ways	sd	5
Well like what we did last time with when Mrs Maher was  talking about about if we split the gold equally what you could  do is well I thought of a lot of ways	So like once I have the  white cube in the middle you split that in half right in the  middle	sd	5
So like once I have the  white cube in the middle you split that in half right in the  middle	Thats what we did last time	sd	1
Ok go ahead	If thats a light green then you  could just make a yellow and add one and a half to the yellow  and one and a half to the other yellow	sd	5
Does anyone know what	means	sd	1
means	I dont want you to tell me yet	sd	1
I dont want you to tell me yet	The light green	sd	4
I dont  understand	You split it in the middle and it would be one and half on each  side	sd	5
Well if were calling this light green three  what are you calling this train with the light green and the  orange together	Well the yellow is I think the yellows um I think yellow is  about five long and the green in the middle Ten  eleven twelve and then thirteen thirteen yellows	sd	4
You were thinking of the whole length of the train as being  thirteen of what	Thirteen	sd	4
Thirteen blues thirteen oranges thirteen what	Thirteen yellows	sd	4
Thirteen yellows	If you turn the light green into yellows	sd	4
I dont understand	Well if you cut that  in the middle and then you  just paint the light green of each piece yellow and youre  making it thirteen and it will be equal to the train	sd	5
Why thirteen	Wait shes getting thirteen from the number of the whole train	sd	1
Well she keeps saying that the length of this is thirteen	Yeah I know I know where shes getting it	sd	2
Yeah I know I know where shes getting it	Well see if you take one of the orange rods and take all these  little things and you put it up to it it will equal ten	sd	5
Well see if you take one of the orange rods and take all these  little things and you put it up to it it will equal ten	And then if you do the same thing with the light green rod itll  equal three	sd	5
And then if you do the same thing with the light green rod itll  equal three	And if you have ten and three its thirteen	sd	5
I understand ok I understand what youre  saying thats wonderful	Yeah thirteen	aa	4
Do we have a minute to do another one or do we have to clean  up	I have another solution	sd	1
I have another solution	I figured you could take two light greens and  put them there	sd	5
I figured you could take two light greens and  put them there	And then after that I just took all these the clear  ones and I figured well I put down seven	sd	5
And then after that I just took all these the clear  ones and I figured well I put down seven	And I  figured that they all equal and if you have these two you would  have three and then you could take one and put it on that and so  it would be four five you would have three four	sd	5
And I  figured that they all equal and if you have these two you would  have three and then you could take one and put it on that and so  it would be four five you would have three four	and then four five five six six and then seven	sd	5
So you figured then that you can put have seven on  each of our halves	Yeah of the halves and then like youre making a new rod	sd	4
Hes saying	Yeah well no well I mean not seven and seven seven and six	sd	4
Yeah well no well I mean not seven and seven seven and six	Its an odd number of white the clears so it wouldnt be seven  one would be seven and one would be six	sd	5
What could I do	What could you do I think what you could do is hmm you  could take this	sv	5
What could you do I think what you could do is hmm you  could take this	And you could replace those two those  three with a light green yeah on of the light greens like that	sd	5
Uh huh oh but I have one for this guy and one for this guy  one for this guy and what about this guy	Oh what this guy would go	sd	1
Would you agree that maybe I could take this one   and saw it in half if I had a saw	Yeah	b	1
And then what could I do with it if I sawed it in half	Then you could put half here and half here	sd	4
We  probably need to clean up	All stand	sd	1
All stand	Onegaishimasu	sd	1
Onegaishimasu	Onegaishimasu	sd	1
Date please interpret this	Multiply all with 10	sd	4
How would you fix this	Number three and number nine	sd	4
Number three and number nine	That problem is wrong	sd	4
Now its okay isnt it	Yes	b	1
Then how about this	Oh negative two X	sd	4
Right	Huh	b	1
Huh	It changed a lot when it became negative two	sd	4
So because this is here you can change the direction you know	You dont change it at the negative two part	sd	4
You change the direction while you divide both sides with this denominator you know	I didnt change it like that	sd	5
I didnt change it like that	Because this this changes it to negative two	sd	5
Because this this changes it to negative two	Because you do it with this	sv	5
Write it like this and	I was too lazy to write that at the bottom	sd	1
X greater than or equal to seven sixths	Correct	aa	1
People below four are stone	Arai has zero right	sd	1
Fukuda can you see it	Yes	b	1
Can you see	I can see	sd	1
Genji please read the problem	You would like to buy 10 cakes all together for less than 2100 yen	sd	1
You would like to buy 10 cakes all together for less than 2100 yen	One type of cake is 230 yen each and the other cakes are 200 yen each	sd	1
Which cake seems more delicious	The 230yen one	sd	4
Think about how many you could buy and how to figure it out	Do we solve this problem	sd	1
Go ahead	Can you bargain and lower the price	sd	1
Oh dont you know it	Ah I did it	sd	1
I told you not to use this but to use the back didnt I	Were buying 10	sd	4
You need to buy 10 so please buy 10 okay	Buy 10	sd	1
But if you buy 10 230yen cakes how much will it cost	Two thousand three hundred yen	sd	4
I dont care what kind of method you use	Inequality equation	aa	4
Okay go ahead	Is it not permissible to buy nine	sd	1
Is it not permissible to buy nine	I dont get this	sd	3
Can you	Then you exchange	sd	1
How are you going to think about it	Its also okay if its over 10 right	sd	4
Buy 10	Ten	sd	1
Ten	Ten	sd	1
Well then how can you find out how many you can buy	There are people whowould have them take the cake take a 200yen cake and break it in half and make it 100yen	sd	4
Its different from asking to have half a Japanese radish you know	If you ask them to halve the Japanese radish theyd do it for you	sd	1
Not by using equations or things like that but tell me what you have to do to get the answer	Buying two thousand two 2100 yen exactly	sd	4
Buying two thousand two 2100 yen exactly	We dont need to its okay if we have change left over right	sd	4
Well there is one minute of remaining time	I dont understand this	sd	3
Oh there are no paper people	Whats paper	sd	3
How did you think about it	What	ba	1
Okay go ahead	I didnt understand it at all but	sd	3
I didnt understand it at all but	First of all	sd	1
First of all	I thought that I should calculate	sd	5
I thought that I should calculate	How many of the 230yen ones I could buy and	sd	5
How many of the 230yen ones I could buy and	In the beginning when I did it with 10	sd	5
In the beginning when I did it with 10	It ended up being 2300 yen so	sd	5
It ended up being 2300 yen so	Its not good because its over the amount so	sd	5
Its not good because its over the amount so	And then next when I did it with nine	sd	5
And then next when I did it with nine	When I did it with nine it was 2070 yen and it was okay but	sd	5
When I did it with nine it was 2070 yen and it was okay but	you need to buy 10 so when I calculated it	sd	5
you need to buy 10 so when I calculated it	to buy one 200yen cake	sd	5
to buy one 200yen cake	Two 2070 plus	sd	5
Two 2070 plus	Two hundred yen is	sd	5
Two hundred yen is	With 2270 yen and	sd	5
With 2270 yen and	You go over	sd	5
Okay	So then you keep reducing the numbers and	sd	4
Keep reducing and when you do it with eight on this side and two this side then	When I did it	sd	1
When you did it	Time ran out and	sd	1
Time ran out and	I couldnt do it to the end	sd	1
Did you find it in a flash	The 230yen one	sd	4
The 230yen one	You buy three of them and	sd	4
Then how much does it become	Six hundred ninety yen	sd	4
And what about this side	Seven	sd	4
When you buy seven	Two thousand ninety yen	sd	4
If you buy seven if you buy seven 200yen ones how much does it become	One thousand four hundred yen	sd	4
How much is it if you add it	Two thousand and seventy yen	sd	4
Two thousand	Oh	b	1
Oh	Two thousand ninety yen	sd	4
What about yours Joji	Im not done yet	sd	1
What	Im still doing it	sd	1
Your method	Inequality equation	aa	4
Okay what about Luikos	Inequality equation	aa	4
How did you do yours Bancho	Huh	b	1
How did you do that	The same as that	sd	2
Huh	Inequality equation	aa	4
Then how much money is needed	Two thousand three	sd	4
Can you make up the 210 yen	Seven	sd	4
Then if you buy seven of the cakes that are 30 yen cheaper if you do that then what about this side	Three	sd	4
Then how did you think about this one	The total 230 yen oh	sd	5
The total 230 yen oh	Its for some amount and make that amount X and	sd	5
Its for some amount and make that amount X and	You need to buy 10 of the 200yen ones	sd	5
You need to buy 10 of the 200yen ones	So 10 make it 10 minus X and	sd	5
So 10 make it 10 minus X and	And the total has some amount of two 230yen ones	sd	5
And the total has some amount of two 230yen ones	And the 230yen ones are 230 X	sd	5
And the 230yen ones are 230 X	And the 200yen one is 200	sd	5
And the 200yen one is 200	bracket 10 minus X And then then 200 230 X plus 200 bracket 10 minus X	sd	5
bracket 10 minus X And then then 200 230 X plus 200 bracket 10 minus X	is less than minus less than or equal to 2100 yen	sd	5
is less than minus less than or equal to 2100 yen	And you form the inequality equation	sd	5
What do you need to answer	How many 230 yen cakes you buy	sd	4
What	Because its not enough	sd	4
Huh	Add	sd	4
Then then how many is it here	X	b	4
Ryusaki how do you come up with four here	Subtract	sd	4
Then if this is X then what is this	Ten minus X	sd	4
Okay Sakai how much is it here when you take the parentheses off	Huh	b	1
Well then how do you do two bracket X plus three	Two X	sd	4
Well then remove the brackets	I did it	sd	1
I did it	I did it	sd	1
I did it	Four plus five	sd	4
Four plus five	You multiply it right	aa	4
Bracket 200 times 10 is see	Two thousand	sd	4
Two thousand minus you multiply this so this time on this side so okay	Two hundred X	sd	4
Then which is the next one that you transpose	Two thousand	sd	4
Itll become 10	Thirds	sd	4
Which is easier doing it onebyone or using an inequality equation	An inequality equation	sd	4
Its like this you know	Twelve times	sd	4
Its not a 12 you know	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Twenty	sd	4
What about you Uchida	Huh	b	1
Huh	Two hundred	sd	4
Look at the figure and set up an equation and work it out okay	What number	sd	1
Number two	Number two	aa	1
Okay Watabe	Uh wait a second	sd	1
Okay go ahead	You dont understand if you dont look at anything	sd	1
Its not written	This is going to appear in the equation	sd	1
This is going to appear in the equation	Oh how much is it for the baskets	sd	3
The basket price is	Eighty yen isnt it	sd	4
Eighty yen	The total was 1000 yen wasnt it	sd	4
Watabes is less than 2000 yen	Two thousand	sd	1
Eight	Its wrong	sd	1
Its wrong	What	ba	1
What	What is this	sd	1
What is this	What	ba	1
This the answer of this inequality equation is wrong isnt it	Isnt it okay	sd	1
Isnt it okay	Because this is 10 right	sd	4
Because this is 10 right	Is this the answer	sd	1
Is this the answer	With 80	ba	4
Its this value here	Two times nine	sd	4
Two times nine	What about eight	sd	3
What about eight	Seven hundred fifty	sd	4
Huh	The answer is	sd	1
The answer is	What is the answer	sd	3
What is the answer	Is it this	sd	1
However this wont be the answer to the applied problem so	One hundred seventy over 20	sd	4
Seventeen over two right	So teacher if you do it like this is it correct	sd	1
Fifty times 15 is look	Not yet	sd	1
Then it becomes 750	For example how do we write the answer	sd	1
Its 70 times 20 so its not 140 but its only one zero right	Who can read this	sd	1
Who can read this	Who cant read this	sd	1
Didnt I teach this to you before	One hundred forty four	sd	4
About it being exactly 2000 yen why did it become exactly 2000 yen here	Since its divisible	sd	4
What	The basket price	sd	4
Is it okay	Yes okay	aa	1
Then Ill hand out the problems for number 10 and finish	From what number to what number are there	sd	1
One two okay	Four more	sd	1
Please get ready to bow	Stand	sd	1
Stand	Thank you very much	aa	1
Thank you very much	Thank you very much	aa	1
Yes Cassie	Do we do it on our head or on our paper	sd	1
And you dont have to copy the question you can just show your thinking	He said that he multiplied it so the area is right but 7 times 4	sd	5
The top one were doing the top one first	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mmm	sd	1
Or to show me why	I feel like this one cause like I agree with Robbie because	sd	4
Can you show it in a picture	Yeah	b	1
And why do you think with the friend	Because its 12 which is 3 inches 3 inches	sd	5
It says Robbie says the area	Oh	b	1
Oh	Area	sd	4
Oh you were thinking perimeter	Yeah	b	1
Okay so who do you agree with	Robbie	sd	4
And can you prove it	I think	sv	1
How could you prove it in the picture	Um  I dont know	sd	1
Can you prove it in the picture	Is it width times length	sd	4
Ask Jason	Is it	aa	1
So why dont you explain what you did	Um to the	sd	1
Which part of the picture is the area	The length times width	sd	4
Oh so the   which part of the picture	inside	aa	4
What does that mean	Theres 9 squares	sd	4
So now who do you agree with	Robbie	sd	4
You  Why	Because theres 9 squares in the box	sd	5
And then what is his friend thinking	Theres 12	sd	4
So what   his friend is his friend confused	Yeah	b	1
Whats his friend thinking	The perimeter	sd	4
Cassie	Um you could take a ruler some sort of ruler and measure the length and then the width and then you could multiply them	sd	5
Mm hm	Finding out what is the length and what is the width	sd	4
Alex	After you found it out you would multiply them	sd	4
What did that student do	Its the area	sd	5
Its the area	And the total of it is 9 sided	sd	5
And the total of it is 9 sided	Which is the area	sd	5
Which is the area	Cause 3 which is the length and 3 which is the width	sd	5
Cause 3 which is the length and 3 which is the width	You multiply those two and its 9	sd	5
Do you agree	Yes	b	2
What do you see	The area	sd	4
And what is the area	9	b	4
What are you actually seeing	9 boxes	aa	4
What did you do	I drew 3  cause I made 3 columns and 3 rows	sd	5
3 columns and 3 rows	Because there are 3 inches on the width and 3 inches on the length	sd	5
Stacey	Square inches	sd	4
DAndre	Its 1 inch squared	sd	4
Its what was that	Its 1 inch squared	sd	4
Shira	9	b	4
Cassie	9 inches  squared	sd	4
Do you guys agree with Robbie or his friend	Robbie	sd	4
And Rebecca Im actually going to	The greater the slant length per difference in the diameters equals a larger roll radius	sd	5
The greater the slant length per difference in the diameters equals a larger roll radius	Okay so I kind of just tried and solve the whole thing but basically I found that if you multiply the slant times the wide diameter you get two times the roll radius and I tried that three times and it worked for three	sd	5
Okay so I kind of just tried and solve the whole thing but basically I found that if you multiply the slant times the wide diameter you get two times the roll radius and I tried that three times and it worked for three	The E Cup E it didnt work and I wasnt sure why but the other three worked	sd	5
The E Cup E it didnt work and I wasnt sure why but the other three worked	So I wasnt sure  She did say to think about if the slight hand  slight  slant height was adjusted so I dont know if that would change the equation	sd	5
So I wasnt sure  She did say to think about if the slight hand  slight  slant height was adjusted so I dont know if that would change the equation	Okay	b	1
Okay	So you multiplied which  What by what	sd	3
So you multiplied which  What by what	The slant length times the wide diameter and youd get two times the roll radius	sd	5
The slant length times the wide diameter and youd get two times the roll radius	So I dont know how to factor in the narrow diameter	sd	3
So I dont know how to factor in the narrow diameter	So two times the roll radius	sd	4
So two times the roll radius	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	But then youd need to know the roll radius before	sd	4
But then youd need to know the roll radius before	Yeah	b	2
So thats what youre trying to find	Ten point	sd	4
Ten point	Its point nine nine	sd	2
Its point nine nine	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Or  yeah	b	2
Or  yeah	Okay and then for	sd	1
Okay and then for	Thats for wide right	sd	4
Thats for wide right	Yeah for wide	sd	2
Yeah for wide	And then for the wide for B it would be  942	sd	4
And then for the wide for B it would be  942	Exactly	aa	2
Exactly	9424 something like that	sd	4
9424 something like that	Okay	b	2
Okay	Okay	b	2
Okay	For C the wide diameter	sd	4
For C the wide diameter	Okay so note the similarities within groups and	sd	4
Okay so note the similarities within groups and	Yeah so compare them	sd	2
Yeah so compare them	So for A the wide diameter is three and a half and so is like for F And then they both have the same slant length	sd	5
So for A the wide diameter is three and a half and so is like for F And then they both have the same slant length	But A has a narrow diameter of three and then F has two	sd	5
But A has a narrow diameter of three and then F has two	And A has a much larger roll radius so maybe that affects how it works	sd	5
And A has a much larger roll radius so maybe that affects how it works	And if	sd	1
And if	Wait so the narrow diameter	sd	1
Because the circumference  if you calculate the circumference it might just be a lot of extra work	Something like that	sd	4
Something like that	Do you think we could use that to make our equation like the area of the cup	sv	2
Do you think we could use that to make our equation like the area of the cup	Like the area or the volume	sd	4
Like the area or the volume	The volume like so how much water it holds	sd	2
The volume like so how much water it holds	Yeah but what if this holds the same volume as like this but this one is less  like not  it doesnt have like a slant	sd	3
Yeah but what if this holds the same volume as like this but this one is less  like not  it doesnt have like a slant	Never mind	sd	1
Never mind	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Im just trying to think of a formula	sd	1
Im just trying to think of a formula	It could be a relationship between area and volume	sd	4
It could be a relationship between area and volume	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah thats what I was trying to say	sd	2
Yeah thats what I was trying to say	Like not independent	sd	4
Like not independent	The wide diameter for A F H because they all have the same wide diameter	sd	5
The wide diameter for A F H because they all have the same wide diameter	Oh yeah three and a half	sd	2
Oh yeah three and a half	So the circumference is 1099	sd	4
So the circumference is 1099	She said we shouldnt look at the circumference	sd	1
She said we shouldnt look at the circumference	So okay	sd	1
So okay	For H theres no narrow diameter and the slant length is three and three fourths and then the roll radius is three and three fourths	sd	5
For H theres no narrow diameter and the slant length is three and three fourths and then the roll radius is three and three fourths	So H wait H would be a cone right	sd	4
So H wait H would be a cone right	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yes I think yours is  like yours definitely has a pattern but I dont think its correct	sv	2
Yes I think yours is  like yours definitely has a pattern but I dont think its correct	Theres still a lot of outliers	sd	4
Theres still a lot of outliers	Want to just calculate the rest to see how that	sd	1
Want to just calculate the rest to see how that	Only F and G or all of them	sd	3
Only F and G or all of them	Well F and G these  we already know that these two dont  these three dont add up	sd	2
Well F and G these  we already know that these two dont  these three dont add up	Okay	b	1
Okay	Are you doing F	sv	1
Are you doing F	Ill do F	sd	1
Ill do F	Okay	b	1
Have you hit a wall	Yeah	b	1
You can do this	Yeah whenever you include like both its bigger	sd	4
Yeah whenever you include like both its bigger	So put in return	sd	1
So put in return	Roll radius	sd	4
Roll radius	A slight difference	aa	4
A slight difference	over 125	sd	4
over 125	between the top and bottom diameter	sd	4
between the top and bottom diameter	Five point wait   five and three fourths	sd	4
Five point wait   five and three fourths	575	b	4
575	creates a larger roll radius	sd	4
creates a larger roll radius	multiplied by R	aa	4
multiplied by R	Yeah that makes sense	sd	2
Yeah that makes sense	Then you want to leave space for diagrams too	sd	1
Then you want to leave space for diagrams too	Okay	b	1
Okay	So Im just going to box this off so I can put the equation here	sd	1
So Im just going to box this off so I can put the equation here	We dont have plenty of space there	sd	1
We dont have plenty of space there	What kind of guy is that	sd	1
You guys are so late	for the camera	sd	1
You wanted to step into the picture very explicitly	Sir	sd	1
And homework according to the study calendar was the last the last part of the basic materials	Sir	sd	1
Bram	I uh brought the wrong notebook with me	sd	1
I wanted you to demonstrate later how you do those types of exercises	No	b	1
No	But I do have	sd	1
Marian what is it	I dont understand 31	sd	3
Can you guys calm down a bit here	Yes but  isnt here yet	sd	1
Keep that bunch quiet over there	Okay Ill keep those little ones quiet	sd	1
The very last one	Yes	b	1
The very last one Ill keep that in mind	Twentyeight C	sd	3
You are very late with that arent you	Yes	b	1
Why dont you take care of that during a Dalton hour	Thirtysix	sd	3
The last two assignments Sam help me out here	Thirtysix	sd	3
What is it	Didnt I have to stay behind now	sd	1
How can you get this equa multiplication to resolve	The four X uh squared two divided by X  four	sd	4
X times four X is that four X squared or not	Yes	b	1
X times what	Twelve	sd	4
Hans	Y equals X and between brackets four X plus twelve	sd	4
Four X times What makes four X squared	Four X times X	aa	4
And four X times what makes 12 X	Plus three	sd	4
If you apply that then you can write down	Four X and between brackets X plus three	sd	4
Tim	Yes	b	1
Where do I have to fill in these two parts	Below the uh	sd	4
Wait a minute	No I tried without any	sd	1
Right	Yes	b	1
Did you do it yourself without using a table	I did it with the help of	sd	1
Not with the help of the answer book I hope	Some of them I did	sd	1
What do you learn if you copy it from the answer book	Not much	sd	1
Where does it belong	Um below the below the multiplication um sign	sd	4
Did you draw the table	Yes	b	1
Because that is part of a multiplication in the equation it doesnt say that you have to multiply two X squared by something	Oh no you need to write it here	sd	4
Minus two X times what is minus two X squared	Um I dont know	sd	1
Where did the little squared come from Lisa	Oh times X	sd	1
Times	X	b	4
Makes minus 54 X		b	4
So what equation do you get with brackets	Minus two X um times X plus 27	sd	4
Where does the minus three S squared come from in the table	Um	b	1
Um	Um in front it says three S	sd	4
This where do I have to fill this in	Uh underneath	sd	4
Uh underneath	Uh underneath	sd	4
And the plus nine S	Well next to it	sd	4
Suggest something	Um in front three S	sd	4
In front three S	And then an S at the top	sd	4
Three S times S makes	Um no I mean negative S	sd	4
And here	Um three	sd	4
Three	Yes three	sd	4
Thats all	Yes add the plus	sd	4
Okay equation	That becomes three S and in between brackets minus S plus three	sd	4
Marian	Where did you come up with three S and that minus	sd	3
Minus three times	S	b	4
Yes squared but I want to resolve it completely to a multiplication	S times S	sd	4
Nine S is in fact	Nine times S	sd	4
Write further as a multiplication	Three times	sd	4
Three times	Three times S	sd	4
And what do these two have in common	last times S	sd	4
last times S	last times S	sd	4
A factor	Three	sd	4
And that is the common part which you can write down in front	Sir	sd	1
But if you cant do it then take a piece of scratch paper and write it all out on it	I put uh the minus in front of the three S instead of the S	sd	4
I put uh the minus in front of the three S instead of the S	Yeah theres no space for that	sd	2
What will the upper part look like Freek	The S on top	sd	4
This is correct yes	And on the left uh the minus three	sd	4
Here	Yes	sd	1
What equation would you write down next	H is minus three S and then in brackets S minus three	sd	4
But I would	But is it correct then	sd	1
Peter	But you have to end up with the highest number up front in front eh	sd	4
As many as possible	Oh as many numbers as possible or letters and such	sd	4
As long as you can still see a common factor here then you havent taken out enough yet	Oh I see	aa	1
What happened to Patty	Over here	sd	1
That is correct very well	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Sir	sd	1
Sir	Is this a little plus sign	sd	1
Is this a little plus sign	For if we put minus eight H over here this one over here is 24	sd	4
Uh huh	Then again minus 24 H  and then simply plus three	sd	4
You had written down in the equation 18 X and	Yes	b	1
Yes	Oh minus	aa	4
This one you can already put in the right place	Here	b	1
No just in front	Here	b	1
Now that 18 isnt correct any more is it	No	b	1
You should try to write an S differently than a five dont you think	Is this is this an S then	sd	1
I am inclined to say it is 55	Okay	b	1
Yes	Sir I just dont feel well	sd	1
The second one	But I I just dont feel well	sd	1
Whats the matter	I just dont feel well	sd	1
What do you want to do	Outside the classroom I dont really know	sd	1
Em	I am just very nauseous	sd	1
Yes	With the other ones you could always fill in there you could already do one	sd	4
This one where can you put it as well	Here	b	4
That would be S cubed	That has to be S	sd	4
Five minutes have been up for a long time	Shoot Im only at three	sd	1
Bram	Look at this one it says minus no so that becomes three T Minus three T minus two squared	sd	4
B6	And then	sd	1
And then	B6	b	1
B6	And then here I have since minus three T youve got to have a T here in any case and over there as well	sd	5
Because those two do those two still have anything in common	Oh I could have made this three T	sd	4
Yes you are better off making a new table because you are crossing out so much now	So here just a minus	sd	4
And now here here you took out minus T Where is	It is now over here	sd	4
Yes then you have to remove it there	Over here nothing	sd	4
And remove that one as well	So then this becomes	sd	1
And now you can make the correct equation	Gives minus three T one T	sd	4
Which one didnt work	I had this one differently	sd	1
The seven P and the 21 do they have anything in common	Um	b	1
Um	Yes	b	1
What is it	Um let me see	sd	1
Um let me see	Ah the seven itself	sd	4
Let me put it this way Lisa if I would give for example four points for this assignment on a test then you would still have gotten three	Oh right	b	1
Someone who takes out the seven just deserves that extra little point	Yes	b	1
Yes	Can I take your eraser	sd	1
Can I take your eraser	Minus three T and then why is this here	sd	4
Homework for next time is given in your study calendar	G and P	sd	1
Okay	Here it says minus three T Do you have to fill that in over here	sd	1
Assignment D Let me see you can fill this in the right place which is not the problem	Yes	b	1
Yes	And then	sd	1
And now you have to solve the puzzle	Yes	b	1
But you could have done	Oh	aa	1
Because do those two still have anything in common	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Well yes	b	1
Yes	The factor	sd	4
Which one	Three	sd	4
You could have taken three out as well	Oh right	b	1
Furthermore it says here not that thats a very big deal here it said a plus and you wrote a minus	Oh yeah thats right	aa	1
So if you also put the minus in front you better make a new table	Oh right	b	1
Here you dont write a T but	Oh but minus three T	sd	4
Just make a new table okay	This one wait a minute over here	sd	1
This one wait a minute over here	I had this one is here and then I had this one	sd	1
Do these two still have anything in common	Yes	b	1
What	Yes you can divide them again by oh no	sd	4
Yes though	Yes that by three uh	sd	4
And this two you could have taken out as well	Oh	b	1
You are better off in making a new table otherwise you may not understand it anymore	And you dont need to write the one down do you at uh	sd	1
No you dont have to write it down but you do have to write the first part of the equation down	Oh	b	1
Thats part of it	Okay	b	1
but then dont write four H but eight minus eight H that will make it correct	Sir I dont get do I need to finish C	sd	1
Sir I dont get do I need to finish C	Yes	b	1
Huh	I understand the equation but I dont know how to explain it	sd	1
I understand the equation but I dont know how to explain it	I do understand that I have to end up with six plus nine and one	sd	4
Here I will take the same six cells plus two times three	Oh right	b	1
Then you can use this equation	Okay	b	1
But they can both still be correct	Okay	b	1
Uh what is in number 30	Ninetysix	sd	4
Without writing down the whole list	Ninetysix  should be correct	sd	4
Yes maybe but how do you explain that	Well I did it like this I thought three of these little blocks make one row that left me with two rows that means six	sd	5
Well I did it like this I thought three of these little blocks make one row that left me with two rows that means six	And then I had 30 left 30 times three plus six	sd	5
Or did you find it yourself	Yes I thought it sounded logical actually	sd	1
Look if all you say is three are added each time	So you have to keep adding until youre there	sd	4
And if you argue from there on you will figure it out as well	Sir	sd	1
They are going to be looking at it in Hong Kong	Then they will know right away that they may take a piece of paper of mine	sd	1
Tell me what did you want to ask	The T Why is the T R	sd	3
Yes	I just see how how how do you have to do that	sd	3
Here you had to to demonstrate two of them	Yes Ive got those	sd	1
So at T five you calculate 10 plus four times three	Yes	b	1
What is the relationship between the number of the term and your equation	It is one less each time	sd	5
It is one less each time	This one is	sd	1
Is that correct here	Yes	b	1
At T 20	Nineteen	b	4
Why dont you go ahead and apply that	Oh right then that makes N minus one	sd	4
Well perfect isnt it	But how does it work here	sd	3
But how does it work here	In the row five seven nine 11 13 is T one five	sd	3
In the row five seven nine 11 13 is T one five	Then this must be T two T three T four T five	sd	3
Yes	The difference between two terms is the same each time	sd	4
The difference between two terms is the same each time	We call a series like that an arithmetical series	sd	4
Yes	Each number in this series is T one plus N minus one	sd	4
Times two	Yes	b	1
It is almost the same as the one you got here right	But then you explain why the equation for the arithmetical series can be written as T N T and	sd	4
But then you explain why the equation for the arithmetical series can be written as T N T and	I dont understand that one	sd	3
Do you recognize the part that is on the board	Yes	b	1
In this in this equation	Yes	b	1
Yes	Those brackets	sd	4
Go ahead and try lets say try to get rid of those brackets entirely	X But may I now write this one here as well	sd	1
Not two to the power of N but just two N Thats right	Where did you get this three	sd	3
T N yes write it down T N equals equals	T one	sd	4
One plus whatever is in your table	Two N minus two	sd	4
Two N minus two	No without times two then	sd	4
And try to shorten it Bram	I dont get B three	sd	1
I dont get B three	What are you supposed to do here do you have to simply	sd	3
Yes fill in the equation	Do you simply have to do one plus three	sd	4
Yes this means that you fill in one for N and that means that you have to fill in twenty for N	So you have to do twenty plus three	sd	4
Yes so you only have to fill it in into the equation	Twenty times 20 equals 20 squared	sd	5
Huh	And so here you put 20 squared	sd	4
Yes	Isnt it better here to calculate minus four T plus three	sd	4
The table is not really correct because minus four T times two	Oh no thats not possible is it	ba	4
If you calculate this multiplication what do you get then	Um eight T	b	4
Thats correct	Yes now it should work	sd	4
Just continue changing the rest	What	ba	3
G and P	Can I reserve the fifth for tomorrow	sd	1
But I am actually happy that you admit it now	Yes but	sd	1
Well it is quite simple if you only use equations and you may do it without a table then of course you can copy it from the answer book	Brian is like	sd	1
So the only people who can talk are hum Mike and Michelle and Jeff	Yeah are are group that s why because we don t share it with anyone else and no one shares it because we are not in their group so we don t know anything	sd	1

It s gunna be twelve	White black wait blue and yellow	sd	5
White black wait blue and yellow	And then we have  white blue and black	sd	5
And then we have  white blue and black	Okay lets see White  and  nine Dana it s nine	sd	5
Okay lets see White  and  nine Dana it s nine	Okay	b	1
Okay	No Dana first I want you to figure it out we may get  different answers	sd	2
No Dana first I want you to figure it out we may get  different answers	Look see you got white white and white	sd	5
Look see you got white white and white	That s three	aa	5
That s three	Then yellow yellow and yellow	sd	5
Then yellow yellow and yellow	That s three  that s six	sd	5
That s three  that s six	And then blue blue blue that s nine	sd	5
And then blue blue blue that s nine	That only makes one two three four five six	sd	2
That only makes one two three four five six	And then we add it s nine	sd	2
And then we add it s nine	So Dana your calculations were wrong	sd	2
So Dana your calculations were wrong	The answer is nine	sd	2
The answer is nine	Okay Dana for the second problem I get to write okay	sd	1
Okay Dana for the second problem I get to write okay	And I get to draw	sd	1
And I get to draw	Because if you can get three from each one of these	sd	5
Because if you can get three from each one of these	We did it it s nine	sd	5
How did you get nine	We just drew lines again	sd	1
We just drew lines again	See we drew shirts and since each one of them can go to  three pairs of jeans three six nine	sd	5
Oh three six nine	Because there are three pairs and shirts and three pairs of  pants	sd	5
Because there are three pairs and shirts and three pairs of  pants	If each shirt could go to three pairs it would be three  six nine	sd	5
If each shirt could go to three pairs it would be three  six nine	Three on top three on the bottom	sd	5
Think about it you don t have to do  that one	You would have to do this one like four Like three six  nine twelve	sd	5
You would have to do this one like four Like three six  nine twelve	It would be twelve	sd	5
It would be twelve	Three six nine twelve	sd	5
You re convinced	Is twelve your lucky number Dana	sd	1
Is twelve your lucky number Dana	What	ba	1
What	Is twelve your lucky number	sd	1
Is twelve your lucky number	Yes	b	1
What do you think we  are going to do now	Fill in that number board	sd	4
Are you   all thinking of your numbers	Oh	b	1
Oh	No	b	1
Where would you put it	On top	b	4
Brian	Should we go from zero to one	sd	1
All eyes are on Audra to see what she will pick	No	b	2
No	Thats not right	aa	2
Thats not right	She puts one half on the zero	sd	2
She puts one half on the zero	That is half between  negative and positive but that is not a half on the number line	sd	4
That is half between  negative and positive but that is not a half on the number line	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	She is putting a half there we have three negative and three positive numbers she  is using negative three as the beginning of the line and the positive three as the  end	sd	2
She is putting a half there we have three negative and three positive numbers she  is using negative three as the beginning of the line and the positive three as the  end	It should be one half between zero and three because on that side is the negative  side	sd	5
Bryan thinks it should go between the zero and the three	I do too	sd	2
I do too	I think she is right	sd	2
I think she is right	I dont think so because its at the end	sd	5
Graham	Well she might have thought the ones before the zero like the three two one  were not negative	sd	2
Where would you put the one half  Graham	But if I did not know it was negative I would put it under the zero	sd	4
You would put it under the zero	If I didnt know it was negative	sd	4
David	I agree with Audra because since it is integers it would go both ways zero is one  half of the whole thing that keeps on going cause that where you start you can  keep on going either way but that is the middle	sd	5
I agree with Audra because since it is integers it would go both ways zero is one  half of the whole thing that keeps on going cause that where you start you can  keep on going either way but that is the middle	I agree with Audra and David because there is no way	sd	2
I agree with Audra and David because there is no way	I heard Michael say that  the half would have to be on the positive side its integers they keep going if it is  on the positive side its not going to be equal halves the negatives would be larger  than the positives and if you even make the number line bigger zero is right in  the middle so it is going to have to be half	sd	5
Lets here from Jessica	Well on that number line it really is half because if you are going to put it on  this side or this side would be really be a quarter	sd	5
Well on that number line it really is half because if you are going to put it on  this side or this side would be really be a quarter	If you put it on the two it will  be a quarter because you will have one two three and then four	sd	5
I want to make that my number line	That is not half anymore	sd	4
Alan	Since you added on the four then that mean you now have four numbers positive  but three numbers negative	sd	4
By the way do I really have four numbers positive	You have four numbers negative	sd	4
You have four numbers negative	You have five numbers positive   zero one  two three and four	sd	4
Numbers up to four	This cant be one half	sd	4
Does that number line end at four	No	b	1
Does it end at five	No	b	1
Where does it end	Nowhere	b	4
Nowhere	It keeps on going	sd	4
Where does it end on the other side	Nowhere	b	4
I would like to know where I would put  negative one half	Negative one half	sd	1
Negative one half	You have to have an even number	sd	4
You have to have an even number	All negative numbers are different than positive	sd	5
All negative numbers are different than positive	From here down you are negatives so that means any number  here cannot be equivalent to a number over there  so that means if you were dividing this part up into fractions   you would have to put one half mark in the negative right about there	sd	5
So you would put a negative one half between negative one and negative two	Yeah	b	1
What do you think about that Meredith	Because one and one and one half and one half is three	sd	5
Where would you put threequarters	Negative or positive	sd	3
Positive threequarters	Positive threequarters that is simple	sd	1
Why dont you all sit  down	If you are asking where is three fourths three fourths would be here here and  here	sd	5
If you are asking where is three fourths three fourths would be here here and  here	This would be onequarter this would be twoquarters this would be three quarters and this would be fourquarters	sd	5
This would be onequarter this would be twoquarters this would be three quarters and this would be fourquarters	This would be one and onequarter this would be one and twoquarters	sd	5
This would be one and onequarter this would be one and twoquarters	This would be one and threequarters this would be one and fourquarters	sd	5
I am very confused	If you have zero to one it would not be from zero to four	sd	5
If you have zero to one it would not be from zero to four	You would not divide  it like that	sd	5
You would not divide  it like that	You would divide it one fourth two fourths three fourths four  fourths	sd	5
You would divide it one fourth two fourths three fourths four  fourths	This would be one and one fourth  one and two fourths one and three  fourths two	sd	5
Do not tell me where to  put it	No	b	1
How many of you want to keep it there	No	b	1
How many of you want to put it some where else	You could keep it there but you have to add negative four	sd	4
You could keep it there but you have to add negative four	You have to do something to keep it there	sd	2
David	I think Audra is using the whole thing while Meredith is using from zero to two	sd	2
I think Audra is using the whole thing while Meredith is using from zero to two	When adding up all those numbers on the negative side would just be like doing  nothing	sd	4
I am kind of  curious where she would do that	She is like cutting the number line	sd	2
I hope you will straighten me out because I am so  confused	It doesnt	sd	4
It doesnt	When you put one more number four	sd	5
When you put one more number four	Before it was from negative three to three  when it was from negative three to three so zero was one half	sd	5
Before it was from negative three to three  when it was from negative three to three so zero was one half	But now that you  added the four to the positive side it is not one half both sides of the negative and  positive are not equivalent	sd	5
Did you say that Michael	You could put a million millionths there	sd	4
James	I think that one half might go between zero and one	sd	5
I think that one half might go between zero and one	Half of it is negative one  negative two negative three	sd	5
Half of it is negative one  negative two negative three	The other half is one two three four	sd	5
So am I hearing James say that one half is another name for two fourths	UmHum	b	1
What do you think is that possibility	Yeah	b	1
That one half is  another name for two fourths	Yeah	b	1
Audra	I agree because	sd	5
I agree because	even fractions so that	sd	5
Want to think about that	Well one half could be anywhere between these number	sd	4
Well one half could be anywhere between these number	one half could be  between	sd	4
Andrew and then James	I think what we are all getting confused about is the length of the number line	sd	5
I think what we are all getting confused about is the length of the number line	We have five positive number and four negative numbers counting the zero	sd	5
We have five positive number and four negative numbers counting the zero	They are not exactly the same so you would have to put one half a little more  over to the positive side where two fourths is now that we have three negative  number and four positive numbers	sd	5
How many agree that is what the confusion is	No	b	2
James	I think the confusion is one half is in the middle of two things	sd	5
I think the confusion is one half is in the middle of two things	So it is confusing  to see in which place between three to four two to three one to two zero to one  negative one to zero  negative two to negative one	sd	5
So it is confusing  to see in which place between three to four two to three one to two zero to one  negative one to zero  negative two to negative one	I think that is the confusion	sv	1
Would you place one half here would you place number one half here	Yeah	b	1
I agree  that you could find the one half the length between two and three I agree but  could place the number one half here	It has to be two and one half	sd	4
Andrew	It has to be two and one half	sd	4
Thats okay Brian we can hear you	Between the zero and the one would be a one half	sd	5
Between the zero and the one would be a one half	Between the one and the two  would be one and one half	sd	5
Between the one and the two  would be one and one half	Between two and three would be two and one half	sd	5
Between two and three would be two and one half	Between three and four would be three and one half and the same on the negative  side	sd	5
What are they thinking Alan	They were thinking negative numbers are equal to positive numbers	sd	2
They were thinking negative numbers are equal to positive numbers	That is  probably what they are thinking	sv	1
That is  probably what they are thinking	Because you cannot add negative numbers and  have them be positive numbers	sd	5
Because you cannot add negative numbers and  have them be positive numbers	Audra was thinking all that is 1 whole and its not	sd	2
Audra was thinking all that is 1 whole and its not	The negative numbers are lower than zero	sd	5
The negative numbers are lower than zero	Zero is said to be the lowest number and they are lower than the lowest	sd	5
Meredith	It is like a ruler here it has the inches one half one and one half two and one  half three and one half four and one half five and one half and so on	sd	5
It is starting to make some sense	OhmHum	aa	1
Are we going to leave it there or take that one half off	Take it off	sd	4
Okay can everybody put their cards next to here and see if	Dont forget the top	sd	1
Dont forget the top	The top	sd	1
Just like before	Wait we have them	sd	1
You add two of the same and	No no take one off from the top of this	sd	4
No no take one off from the top of this	They are the same	sd	4
They are the same	Oh yeah yeah	b	1
Oh yeah yeah	Put that one on the bottom and that one on the top	sd	4
Put that one on the bottom and that one on the top	No up  here	sd	1
No up  here	Great we have them like this	sd	1
Great we have them like this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	A blue one	sd	1
A blue one	Two blue on the bottom and one red on top	sd	4

No blue on top	They are all blue and we wont have any  blue	sd	4
They are all blue and we wont have any  blue	Then red on top	sd	4
Then red on top	No Brian then we will have another one	sd	2
No Brian then we will have another one	Put that on the bottom	sd	4
How is it going	Very good	sd	1
Very good	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We got  blues are on the bottom and reds are on top	sd	4
We got  blues are on the bottom and reds are on top	Well we are putting them back together	sd	1
Well we are putting them back together	You gotta take one  off the top	sd	4
You gotta take one  off the top	Oh good we have	sd	1
Make sure every one is different	And here is a blue one in the middle	sd	4
And here is a blue one in the middle	Blue one in the idle blue one in the middle blue in the  middle	sd	2
Blue one in the idle blue one in the middle blue in the  middle	We have fifteen	sd	4
We have fifteen	Thats definitely the last	sd	4
Thats definitely the last	Your bottoms you can change it al  around	sd	4
Your bottoms you can change it al  around	Take one in the middle like this	sd	4
Take one in the middle like this	Look at this	sd	1
Look at this	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	Triple  match	sd	4
Triple  match	Blues on the top blues on the top  I dont think I have a  match	sd	4
Blues on the top blues on the top  I dont think I have a  match	No this	aa	2
No this	Yes	b	1
Yes	Oh yeah this piece	b	1
Oh yeah this piece	Like this  A  double match a triple match a quadruple match	sd	4
Like this  A  double match a triple match a quadruple match	I am not convinced yet	sd	2
What do you think	So far we got	sd	1
Well you cant do that	We got double match	sd	4
We got double match	We got a quadruple match	sd	4
We got a quadruple match	We are going to have nothing left	sd	4
We are going to have nothing left	One two three four  five six seven eight nine	sd	1
One two three four  five six seven eight nine	This one	sd	1
This one	No match	sd	4
No match	And we are convinced	sd	1
And we are convinced	Brian there is less	sd	4
Oh yeah	There is less because we can only have one two three four  five six	sd	5
There is less because we can only have one two three four  five six	One two tree four seven	sd	5
One two tree four seven	I have seven	sd	5
Lets line them up	We are just going to  that there is only seven	sd	4
Oops there is a same one right here	Ughh	sd	1
Ughh	Two four six	sd	4
Does that one have an opposite	Yes	b	1
Yes	Awesome	sd	1
I thought you said opposite was  blue red blue red blue blue	We never said anything about the opposites	sd	1
But thats what you did it here	Hey alright	sd	1
Hey alright	Lets do it	sd	1
Lets do it	So	sd	1
What is the  opposite of that	You have to say red blue blue	sd	4
What is the opposite of  this	I have no idea	sd	1
If this is the opposite of this what is  the opposite of this	Oh then its two blues and red	sd	4
Oh then its two blues and red	Yes we got it	sd	2
This is what they were talking about up  there	Oh I know	aa	1
Dont mess with the others	Thats the opposites	sd	1
What is the opposite of this	Oh my god its	sd	1
Can someone explain to T2   You want to  call one someone T2	Ok We made a train and if this was considered two what  would the red one be the red rod be	sd	1
Boy that s some problem	And the other one was if this  was considered one  what would the little red rod be	sd	1
Okay so if it was one you said you d call it one fourth and if  it was two what did you say	It would be one and one fourth	sd	4
How many of you agree that if we call the yellow and the  green one two	Two it would be	sd	4
If you call the yellow and green together  one what did you call the red rod	One fourth	sd	4
Because if you don t agree with the arguments that  Audra and Sarah are going to give you you have to come up  with a different argument	Well because see the yellow and the green was the same  size as the brown so if we put the reds up against the no  wait no	sd	5
Well because see the yellow and the green was the same  size as the brown so if we put the reds up against the no  wait no	See because there s if there was one we would if  it was brown we would normally call it one	sd	5
See because there s if there was one we would if  it was brown we would normally call it one	And if we put  the reds up against it we would all call it one fourth so we  thought if we called the yellow and the green one it would  be the same thing as the brown	sd	5
Erik	I agree	aa	2
I agree	Yeah because see if the brown and the yellow and green  theyre equal and theyre both  called one and four of the reds  equal up to one therefore that they d have to be fourths  because there are four parts theyre fourths	sd	5
Brian	We disagree	sd	2
Nice and loud Brian	We thought the um the two we called that one half	sd	4
You agree that when we call  it one that this is a fourth	Yes	b	1
You re not sure you have an  argument	No	b	1
I like to hear your argument and see if you convince  Sarah and Audra who want to be convinced	Well we thought the two  would be called a half	sd	4
The two what Brian	The two would be a half	sd	4
The two of what	When this  is two these  would be  called a half	sd	5
You re saying a red would become a half	Yeah	b	1
Can you convince us	Not really	sd	1
Brian	Jackie thought of the two	sd	2
So she should be able to explain  it	Well this was called two  and this would be called  all of these would be called one half	sd	5
Well this was called two  and this would be called  all of these would be called one half	Because  uh um	sd	5
You don t remember how you did that	Yeah I forgot	sd	1
Because you also called it one half  didnt you you and Meredith	Um yeah and um so if this is called two  and then this would be two too	sd	5
Um yeah and um so if this is called two  and then this would be two too	So then this would be one  and this would be one	sd	5
Michael did you follow it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	All right so	aa	1
It might help other people  follow it so let s give David another chance and then maybe  Michael can help him out and Meredith	Alright so if this is two   then this would be a half because if you put another one and  another one that d be two	sd	5
Is that what you were thinking Jackie	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I just couldn t it out	sd	1
You want to try it again now that  David helped you the way he was thinking	No	b	1
If you think  you understand it maybe that might help some people	If you take these two  that would be one half	sd	5
And this would be another one half	These would be one	sd	4
These would be one	These are ones	sd	2
These are ones	And then if you take one away then this  would be a half	sd	5
And is it okay to  do it this time	No	b	1
Jakki want to talk about that a little  bit	Well if this if well it s because of this one because it s two	sd	5
Well if this if well it s because of this one because it s two	If we call this both of these one half it  would be one	sd	5
Oh so you re saying its okay to call it one half if we call this  one	Yeah	b	1
Erik	I think the confusion is they think that they just they think  they have the temptation of calling since there are four red  blocks they think they re gonna call it one fourth  cause they  forget that the yellow and the green are two	sd	5
They are thinking that the yellow and the green are one when  they do that	Because see if you have one there d be two halves but if  you have two its two halves plus two halves which would be  four halves	sd	5
Because see if you have one there d be two halves but if  you have two its two halves plus two halves which would be  four halves	So you d have therefore youd have to call one  of the reds one half	sd	5
Which is bigger one half or one third	Let s see	sd	1
You want to put these in the middle Erik so that you and  Alan can share them	One third and one half	sd	4
One third and one half	One third	sd	2
One third	The blue can be divided into  thirds	sd	4
The blue can be divided into  thirds	You think I care	sd	1
You think I care	You don t need that	sd	2
You don t need that	See Alan you messed it all up	sd	1
As I walk around and  I watch what youre doing are we allowed to switch candy  bars	No	b	1
Are we allowed if were making a half and third are we  allowed to have different size candy bars	No	b	1
Remember thats the rule from now on in mathematics	Get the model of a half	sd	4

Unfair info this is no model of a half	A half would be bigger nevertheless	sd	4
A half would be bigger nevertheless	What	ba	3

A half would be bigger nevertheless	There s no half of a blue then why did you pick the blue	sd	3
There s no half of a blue then why did you pick the blue	And give this back  you  don t need it	sd	4
And give this back  you  don t need it	There s nothing else that can be divided into thirds and  halves	sd	4
There s nothing else that can be divided into thirds and  halves	Yeah I m sure there isn t	sd	2
Yeah I m sure there isn t	You d have to make your own rod for each one  em	sd	4
You d have to make your own rod for each one  em	Dr Landis	sd	1
Dr Landis	You don t need the blue	sd	4
You don t need the blue	We re not using the blue	sd	4
We re not using the blue	We re  using the brown	sd	4

If I just find the right rod	Ok what rod are we going to use  then	sd	3
Ok what rod are we going to use  then	It can t be divided into anything	sd	4
It can t be divided into anything	Your own rod	aa	1
Your own rod	What are you doing	sd	3

Get off	Meredith Let s do the model that I did before	sd	1
Meredith Let s do the model that I did before	Remember	sd	1

That s nine remember	You can only make it  with the even bars	sd	4
You can only make it  with the even bars	Now lets get three of these and  make a half out of that if we can	sd	1
Now lets get three of these and  make a half out of that if we can	Wait let me do the red ones	sd	1
Wait let me do the red ones	And you take two light greens and that would be equal and  they d be equal	sd	5
And you take two light greens and that would be equal and  they d be equal	And if you take the purple and the dark  greens and you made the purple a third and then the greens a  half then they d be equal	sd	5
And if you take the purple and the dark  greens and you made the purple a third and then the greens a  half then they d be equal	Thats what youre gonna tell the class	sd	1
Thats what youre gonna tell the class	We can raise  our hands	sd	1
We can raise  our hands	Wait lets in the meantime let me try to figure out another  way	sd	1
Wait lets in the meantime let me try to figure out another  way	How about three of these	sd	3
How about three of these	I dont think  theres any other ways	sd	5
I dont think  theres any other ways	Only three reds and two light green and three purples two  dark greens	sd	5
Only three reds and two light green and three purples two  dark greens	How many ways can you get	sd	3
How many ways can you get	Its not equal	sd	4
Its not equal	Whats smaller than this	sd	3
Whats smaller than this	Dark green	sd	4
Dark green	Ok What s	sd	1
Ok What s	And smaller than that	sd	3
And smaller than that	Yellow	sd	4
Yellow	Im trying yellow	sd	1
Im trying yellow	What  half of an orange	sd	3
What  half of an orange	This	sd	4
This	Whats third of an orange	sd	3
Whats third of an orange	Oh do you have  one more purple	sd	1
Oh do you have  one more purple	No that wouldn t work either	sv	4
What do you have here	We found out if you take two dark greens and you make each  one a half and you make these a third they d be  equal	sd	5
So which is bigger	They re equal in these colors	sd	4
What number name is this	A half	sd	4
What number name is this	One third	sd	4
One third	A third	sd	2
Which is bigger a half or a third	The half	sd	4
The half is bigger	Oh yeah	b	1
Right by how much	By an inch	sd	4
Sure it s a quarter	Oh	b	1
Change your mind	Yeah	b	1
Okay can you explain that	Maybe	sd	1
Maybe	Not real	sd	1
Not real	Okay so what  would these be	sd	3
Okay so what  would these be	They re  six	sd	4
They re  six	One fourth	sd	2
One fourth	And one half	sd	4
And one half	A half plus a fourth	sd	4
A half plus a fourth	Oh God	ba	1
Oh God	Wouldn t they be one third	sd	4
Wouldn t they be one third	A third	sd	2
A third	No	b	4
No	What would we call that	sd	3
What would we call that	Two of these white ones	sd	3
Ok uh I know were not going to have enough time to hear  from all these wonderful solutions Im seeing but Im hoping  that on Monday if you dont forgotten what youve done you  can start thinking about it and Dr Landis said she may stop  by here on Monday and Dr Martino will be here and we  hope youll share your solutions and write about it but lets  hear a real quick one from from Laura and from Jessica	Well this this here would be  one third the pink would be one third	sd	4
Well this this here would be  one third the pink would be one third	And one half would  be the green the dark green	sd	4
So which is bigger	The one half	sd	4
So the  next question how much bigger	It s the size  of the red	sd	4
Alan	One sixth	sd	4
Why do you think so Alan	Because we know already that that three reds would make a  dark green and if there are two dark greens to make the  orange and the and the red rod then it would take six red  rods to make the orange and the red rod	sd	5
What do you think about that	I think that well are you doing it between zero and two	sd	4
I think you are doing it between zero and one	That is not half	sd	4
Closer to zero or closer to one	You could use the ruler	sd	1
And place let s say numbers between zero and three or negative one and two or negative two and two and see what you would come up with	Now you need to move it more over towards the one	sd	4
You could do it more exact on the board	Do it in the middle	sd	4
Do it in the middle	Yeah	b	1
What do you think	I don t know	sd	3
How many of you like where Laura places onequarter	No	b	2
What don t you like	Is she doing it between zero and one or zero and two	sd	2
Does it matter	No	b	1
No	You should put it on the half if it is going to be zero to two	sd	5
You should put it on the half if it is going to be zero to two	Yeah you could divide all the zero to one into all those fractions or you could divide the zero to two into all those fractions	sd	2
Can one half and one quarter go in the same spot	Where the one half is If you are going to two it can because if zero and two the half of it is one and usually the fourths are a half of a half so the half that you put there would be the fourth	sd	5
Thank you very much Laura	It looks like a third	sd	4
Can a fraction have more than one place	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Three quarters is on the other side of the half	sd	4
But some of you seem to think it could go somewhere else and I m very confused	It could stay there or it could also go somewhere else if you double it or multiply it or	sd	5
Erik	The onequarter should be moved over towards the zero more	sd	4
The onequarter should be moved over towards the zero more	I know because you need to fit onethird on the other side	sd	5
I know because you need to fit onethird on the other side	It looks like a third	sd	5
That s the big question	There could be but you would have to add more numbers	sd	5
I m talking about onequarter Meredith	There would be infinite places for onefourth because if you enlarged the space between two points you could divide that into onefourths	sd	5
I m not saying divide the line	Well you could also put the one fourth on the one half and that could be	sd	4
Well you could also put the one fourth on the one half and that could be	No you can t that s an improper fraction	sd	2
No you can t that s an improper fraction	There are fourths for each whole	sd	2
There are fourths for each whole	If you are dealing with two wholes then that would have to be eight fourths	sd	5
If you are dealing with two wholes then that would have to be eight fourths	Yes there have to	sd	2
Yes there have to	You can t have a one fourth for two wholes	sd	2
You can t have a one fourth for two wholes	But those two wholes can make one whole	sd	2
But those two wholes can make one whole	No they don t	sd	2
No they don t	There are two wholes separate	sd	2
There are two wholes separate	No	sd	2
No	The zero to the two is what we are talking about	sd	2
The zero to the two is what we are talking about	The one is what you were doing the zero to the one	sd	2
The one is what you were doing the zero to the one	The one is the half for the zero and the two	sd	2
The one is the half for the zero and the two	I agree with Alan because those two wholes put together make one whole so you would put the fourth on the half between the zero and the one	sd	5
I agree with Alan because those two wholes put together make one whole so you would put the fourth on the half between the zero and the one	I know but Brian Brian Brian	sd	1
I know but Brian Brian Brian	If you say that you are supposed to have twofourths here and twofourths there and then you divide this into two fourths	sd	5
If you say that you are supposed to have twofourths here and twofourths there and then you divide this into two fourths	Then you are only going to divide this into halves	sd	5
Then you are only going to divide this into halves	You are talking about having them separate but we are not we are talking about having them together	sd	2
You are talking about having them separate but we are not we are talking about having them together	I know but I m saying that you think we should have fourths and they should be four forths	sd	2
I know but I m saying that you think we should have fourths and they should be four forths	And you think that they are one whole together	sv	2
And unless we are agreeing about the same thing then we are going to keep arguing past each other you know	Humhuh	b	1
Does it end or does it go on and on	On and on	sd	4
Does it end or does it go on and on	Ends	sd	4
The Cuisenaire rods that you build does it end or does it go on and on	It ends	sd	4
Yes Jessica	It goes on and on if you could build a model	sd	5
Is he talked about well I could say here is a half right in the middle right	Yeah	b	1
But if you look at the ruler you don t see in the middle here one half do you	No	b	1
No	You see a six	sd	4
Isn t that true	Yeah	b	1
You agree to that right	Ohmhum	aa	1
So maybe what helps is to think about pieces of it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Pieces	sd	1
The question is where to do you fit the other fractions and how do you give them number names	Dr Maher what I think is since Alan says you should have two fourths here and two fourths here but each time you have a whole you have to have four fourths for each whole	sd	5
Yeah but what I want to say to you here is that if you want to put two fourths here  Is it two fourths if you are reading your ruler	No it s one half	sd	4
If you are talking the distance half way between one and two that is what you are telling me to do right	That is one and one half	sd	4
That would have what number name Erik	One and one half	sd	4
One and one half	It wouldn t be fourths	sd	4
It wouldn t be fourths	If you put those two wholes together so then it makes one whole	sd	5
We are not dealing with rods now we are dealing with the number line Brian	And if you think that two wholes have to have four fourths each you are wrong because each whole has to have four fourths to one whole	sd	5
And if you think that two wholes have to have four fourths each you are wrong because each whole has to have four fourths to one whole	If you divide one whole into fourths they have to have four of them to be one whole	sd	5
Now if I have to give it a number name can you give this a number name a half when it is to the right of one	No	b	1
No	You have to call is three fourths	sd	4
You have to call is three fourths	You would have to call it one and one half	sd	2
David	On my paper I did ohm I thought about that	sd	1
On my paper I did ohm I thought about that	I put one and one half there	sd	4
You put one and one half here	Yeah	b	1
Where would you put one and three quarters	You would probably push it a little to the right of one and one half	sd	4
How much to the right of the one and one half would you put it	Like that much	sd	4
Of one and one half you would put one and three quarters	One and one half	sd	4
One and one half	No I mean	sd	1
To the right of this	Yeah it would probably go in the middle of that	sd	4
Why did you think middle Jessica	Because well if you had one and one fourth	sd	5
One and three fourths	Yeah because well I m not sure	sd	3
Something to think about Meredith	Well if you have two twofourths that would be say one and one fourth  one and one half	sd	5
If you keep adding fourths you are telling me	If you have twofourths it is equal to one and one half	sd	5
If you have twofourths it is equal to one and one half	So then you would have two more fourths would equal another half which would equal a whole	sd	5
So you are telling me this is one and one half right	Yeah	b	1
So you are telling me that if I want another fourth what would that be	One and three fourths	sd	4
You are telling me that would be one and three fourths	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah that s it	aa	1
Jessica that is what you were saying	I also I think it would be a fourth because like in a half is two fourths and in that half it should take two fourths	sd	5
I also I think it would be a fourth because like in a half is two fourths and in that half it should take two fourths	It does if you divide the half in half	sd	5
Okay	We are calling that a half because anything past the line is one and whatever	sd	5
Do you understand what I am saying	Ohmhuh	b	1
But something to think about just by the way were would two and a half be	It would be behind the two	sd	4
How many of you think you know where the two and one half would be	Two and one half	sd	4
Two and one half	In the middle of the one and the two	sd	4
In the middle of the one and the two	A little bit past the two	sd	4
How much past the two	Half	sd	4
Half way	Yeah	b	1
Half of what	Half of that ruler	sd	4
Half of that ruler because that ruler is going to be between about what Amy	Two and three	sd	4
So where would you put two and one half	Half of that ruler	sd	4
Isn t that interesting	Yeah	b	1
Audra if I gave the purple the number  name one half what number name would I give to the dark  brown	One half	sd	4
Audra	One half	sd	4
If we gave the purple the number name one half we re going  to give the dark brown the number name one half	No I mean um the dark brown would be one	sd	4
Can you tell me  how you would convince me	Because I put the purple rods up against the brown rod and I  got two purple rods	sd	5
You want to tell us why Laura	Because if you put	sd	1
Nice and loud Laura	Because if you put one of these to	sd	5
You  have to really talk loud	If you put two of these  together and each of  these was one then you one two	sd	5
If you put two of these  together and each of  these was one then you one two	And that   would make that two	sd	5
You  remember how to do that	You name the um yellow one	sd	4
You name the um yellow one	Because um if you take the yellow two yellows and put  them against the orange they match up	sd	5
Because um if you take the yellow two yellows and put  them against the orange they match up	And if if this  is one half of it it d be well if orange is two  you would make this  into a one	sd	5
David	Ohm	sd	1
Ohm	Over there	sd	4
Where would you put three	Further over	sd	4
Would it be in the building	no	b	1
Would it be outside the building	yes	b	1
yes	Youd be all the way to Pittsburg Pennsylvania	sd	1
I bet when you did number lines  before you didnt place numbers between zero and one  did you	no	b	1
I see some  interesting questions have arisen	About the 1100	sd	1
About the 1100	I think	sv	1
Lets talk about the other ones first	Well between zero and one you can divide it into those  fractions	sd	5
Well between zero and one you can divide it into those  fractions	Such as the three fourths would go there  because you would  have the one third there and place one fourth there	sd	5
Such as the three fourths would go there  because you would  have the one third there and place one fourth there	And  it would take three of those to get up to  that mark	sd	5
And  it would take three of those to get up to  that mark	The one half you could use a guideline	sd	5
The one half you could use a guideline	The  others one tenth one onehundredth and one one thousandth	sd	5
The  others one tenth one onehundredth and one one thousandth	I made another because you couldnt really see it on the  other That is where the one thousandth  would be	sd	5
I made another because you couldnt really see it on the  other That is where the one thousandth  would be	You couldnt really make anything bigger than  that because it would be too hard to see	sd	5
Alan	You could put basically the one third in any place in any  three places of that number line because you could have  the thirds going either way	sd	5
You could put basically the one third in any place in any  three places of that number line because you could have  the thirds going either way	I mean you could take it out  from there you could take it out from there or you could  take it out from there	sd	5
I mean you could take it out  from there you could take it out from there or you could  take it out from there	It really doesnt matter	sd	5
It really doesnt matter	So you  really could put it in three different places	sd	5
So where would a second place for that  one third be	The second place for that one third would be somewhere  up here approximately	sd	4
Where would you put two thirds	Two thirds would go right there	sd	5
Two thirds would go right there	Because if you have thirds you would be dividing that  into three parts so you could put it in three different  places	sv	5
How are you comparing the places  where you put the second one third and the two thirds	If you use the rods to sort of bracket like this	sd	4
Lets do that	Here you have thirds	sd	4
Im asking you to mark one third but  remember where I marked zero and one with respect to  where I marked my zero and one	You could mark the one third here	sd	4
You could mark the one third here	or you could mark it between here	sd	4
or you could mark it between here	or you could mark it here	sd	4
So place the number one third on that number line	The number one third would go here	sd	4
Im kind of wondering what you are thinking	Well I would put  it there	sd	4
If that is your number  line and not rods anymore	Well basically what you can do is this could be a third and between there and here that could be a third	sd	4
I believe that	Basically what comes to mind when you think of  fractions you only think of the first one	sv	5
Basically what comes to mind when you think of  fractions you only think of the first one	because you could put it here	sd	5
because you could put it here	here	sd	5
here	or here	sd	5
or here	and it would still be one third	sd	5
and it would still be one third	But you could put one third	sd	5
But you could put one third	two thirds	sd	5
two thirds	or three thirds	sd	5
or three thirds	You could put it in any one of those three places but you  could still go one third	sd	5
You could put it in any one of those three places but you  could still go one third	That would be one third	sd	5
That would be one third	or that would be one one third	sd	5
Andrew	I dont think it would work because if you just put red in  the middle and call that one third then if you put then on  the left side of it three thirds then on the right side of it two thirds then you would be reading it two thirds one  third three thirds	sd	5
I dont think it would work because if you just put red in  the middle and call that one third then if you put then on  the left side of it three thirds then on the right side of it two thirds then you would be reading it two thirds one  third three thirds	So uhm wherever you put it in that  space you always are going to have to start from zero  because you cannot go from one down to zero because  that is getting bigger	sd	5
So uhm wherever you put it in that  space you always are going to have to start from zero  because you cannot go from one down to zero because  that is getting bigger	Because if you start it like that then  you are just switching the zero and one	sv	5
Because if you start it like that then  you are just switching the zero and one	Right	b	2
Right	but you could put one third in anyone of these  places but basically what comes to mind once you think of  fractions is that you always think of the first one it could  go in anyone of these	sv	4
The length of  all of those rods are all one third and you are marking off  the rods the lengths of one third right	Yeah	b	1
But when you mark off the rods to mark off where you  place the numbers is it okay then to make all those  numbers equal to one third	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You could put that there it would be equal to one  third	sd	4
That length is one third but when you place your  numbers on the number line can you write them all as one  third	No	b	1
No	You can put that in the beginning on the number line  but when you think of fractions you could put it in anyone  of these places as long as like you are not basically trying  to divide put another rod in there like this then you would have to put something through there	sd	5
You can put that in the beginning on the number line  but when you think of fractions you could put it in anyone  of these places as long as like you are not basically trying  to divide put another rod in there like this then you would have to put something through there	But  you could put the third in any one of those but they are all  the same length each so they still have the same fraction  value of one third	sd	5
Andrew	Yeah but you see if youre doing that you see you put it  in the middle right then the one on the left side of it is  blank so what they would think it needs to be filled in so  they would fill it in and it would be two thirds because  they mostly have spaces because you take zero to one  hundred	sd	5
Yeah but you see if youre doing that you see you put it  in the middle right then the one on the left side of it is  blank so what they would think it needs to be filled in so  they would fill it in and it would be two thirds because  they mostly have spaces because you take zero to one  hundred	You cant go one third would be next to one  hundred it would have to put like it would be three thirds  next to one hundred because if you divide zero to one  hundred into thirds you cant go from one third	sd	5
You cant go one third would be next to one  hundred it would have to put like it would be three thirds  next to one hundred because if you divide zero to one  hundred into thirds you cant go from one third	And then  by the zero it would be three thirds	sd	5
Why not	Its not the way to put  A ruler has the different numbers  that you count by so if you have all these 1s and you dont  have the numbers that they belong to then	sd	5
Well Alan would argue I think maybe not that this is  one and this is the same length one inch and this is the  same length one inch so why cant we mark these all one	They are the same length but you could take three more  of these	sd	4
Im making a ruler here for  fractions	Right but if you say you wanted to divide it	sd	5
Right but if you say you wanted to divide it	A ruler  shows you how long something is like up here say the red is one inch one inch	sd	5
A ruler  shows you how long something is like up here say the red is one inch one inch	And if you add another one inch on there then that would  be two inches	sd	5
And if you add another one inch on there then that would  be two inches	and you add another inch on there it would be three  inches	sd	5
What  number would I put here if I were making a number line or ruler	Youd put one there	sd	5
Youd put one there	Two there and three there because that would be one inch and that would be two  inches and that would be three inches	sd	5
David you were going to say  something	Well I was just going to say that uhm they may be all the  same thing but when youre measuring something then  you know that if it is an inch you know how many instead  of just counting all of them	sd	5
Do you understand my question	Yeah I think so on the second question well um both my models  were um like in this shape like that	sd	4
Maybe you can build that  one on the overhead when were finished	Cuz I think this was	sv	1
Ok so if you were comparing three quarters  and two thirds how would you do it with that model	Um wait this would be one whole this is one half and one of these  would be one fourth	sd	4
But were doing three quarters and  two thirds	Well cuz this was I think was on the second question	sd	1
Right but now were doing three quarters and two thirds	Lets see um	sd	1
I couldnt help but overhearing that and Im also talking to  David here but I have a question for you and David to think about  Ok	Mmm hmmm	sd	1
He was doing a  different problem right David	Or it would be bigger by	sd	5
Just listen to the rest of what shes says David for a minute	Or it could be bigger by two twentyfourths	sd	4
So Ill leave	I think I have some um models	sd	1
I think so too	But I just cant remember them	sd	1
But Meredith can  you share this with David and then Ill be back because then Ill want  to hear from it in a little bit	This  is called the one these  are  the fourths and these  are the thirds and these are twelfths	sd	5
This  is called the one these  are  the fourths and these  are the thirds and these are twelfths	Its if you take two thirds three fourths	sd	5
Its if you take two thirds three fourths	Yeah I know I made the same model	sd	2
Yeah I know I made the same model	Its bigger by one twelfth	sd	4
Its bigger by one twelfth	Thats what I kept on doing but what I m saying is this	sd	1
Thats what I kept on doing but what I m saying is this	I kept on  making the same shape when I did my models like that	sd	4
I kept on  making the same shape when I did my models like that	Why don t you just work with me because we dont have really a lot  of cubes	sd	3
Why don t you just work with me because we dont have really a lot  of cubes	I had a lot of models I just cant really remember any of them	sd	1
I had a lot of models I just cant really remember any of them	I was  working on the second question	sd	1
I was  working on the second question	I need ones	sd	1
I need ones	Can I use these ones	sd	1
Can I use these ones	I really need ones	sd	1
I really need ones	I  need twentyfour ones	sd	1
I  need twentyfour ones	inaudible	sd	1
inaudible	Do you have any more reds over there	sd	1
Do you have any more reds over there	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Three those are the four fourths	sd	4
Three those are the four fourths	And these are the three thirds	sd	4
And these are the three thirds	And so so they only asked for two thirds so I took out one third	sd	5
And so so they only asked for two thirds so I took out one third	And they only asked for three fourths so I took out one right there	sd	5
And they only asked for three fourths so I took out one right there	And then they said how how much bigger is it and I said by one  twelfth and I put it right there and thats how I got it	sd	5
And then they said how how much bigger is it and I said by one  twelfth and I put it right there and thats how I got it	Well well it ittakes it takes twelve of these to equal up to one to  equal up to all that	sd	5
Well well it ittakes it takes twelve of these to equal up to one to  equal up to all that	So its one twelfth	sd	5
So its one twelfth	Yeah yeah	b	1
Yeah yeah	I was just going to say that	sd	1
I was just going to say that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	This is the same one	sd	1
This is the same one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We want each to have two different models	sd	1
We want each to have two different models	Brian wants to have two models of his own and I want to have two  models of my own	sd	1
Brian wants to have two models of his own and I want to have two  models of my own	You dont have to fill it up all you have to do is put it in there	sd	1
You know  a suggestion I have Alan and Erik if you can find another table  whos solving the same problem maybe you can combine	Well we need a lot more pieces	sd	1
Ok where are we	If you call this a one these fourths these thirds and these twelfths  and these twentyfourths	sd	5
If you call this a one these fourths these thirds and these twelfths  and these twentyfourths	And you take three thirds two thirds three  fourths and two thirds its bigger by one twelfth or two twenty fourths	sd	5
You found in this model that three  quarters was bigger than two thirds by	One twelfth	sd	4
You found in this model that three quarters was  bigger than two thirds by	Two twelfths two	sd	4
Two twelfths  by one twelfth	Yeah one twelfth	sd	4
Can you predict it in your minds  and maybe sketch it or	It would probably be a much much bigger because if the model is  say this big it would need more reds and more whites than these   cause these are small	sd	5
I  need you to think about that	It depends how big the uh model is	sd	4
But to be able to justify your answer why dont you talk to each  other about it and see what you each think and try to uh convince  each other first and then you can try to convince me	I think that this one  might be one twentyfourth  because	sd	4
I think that this one  might be one twentyfourth  because	No because these are twenty fourths	sd	5
No because these are twenty fourths	These are twelfths	sd	5
These are twelfths	Well if it  was double the size of this	sd	5
Well if it  was double the size of this	Yeah I know then this would be one twentyfourth and then this  would be one one fortyeighth or something yeah one fortyeighth	sd	5
Yeah I know then this would be one twentyfourth and then this  would be one one fortyeighth or something yeah one fortyeighth	Question then we might be using something like this and this would  be something like one twelfth or something	sd	5
Question then we might be using something like this and this would  be something like one twelfth or something	three quarters and if you take one of the twelfths and you put it  down here it fits	sd	2
Hmmm thats really interesting	And this is the same here	sd	4
Is that another model there Audra	Yeah yeah cuz this is the same here cuz this is the same size  because theres the same purples and it will fit twelve	sd	5
You have four greens  and you have three purples its just that here you have is it really  different though	Not really	sd	1
What number name is this	Thats a whole and thats a whole	sd	4
What number name did you give it	What number name	sd	1
Are the lengths the same or  different	Theyre the same	sd	4
Are these models I guess this is my question to you  are they really different	No	b	1
Can you think of another	Audra can you help me That one	sd	3
Audra can you help me That one	You dont need halves	sd	4
You dont need halves	I know but its easier for me to find it	sd	2
And what rod would you use to represent one twelfth in that model	In this one	sv	1
Yeah	Hmmm probably this one lets see just a second	sd	1
Just think backward	Just a second Ill try and measure	sd	1
Its the red	I know I know	sd	1
So you think youre going to use red to represent one twelfth	I think	sv	1
I think	I also came up I just came up with just came up with the  oh here it is	sd	1
I also came up I just came up with just came up with the  oh here it is	Nope I didnt get up to another model	sd	1
Nope I didnt get up to another model	Yes I think I have fourths Mike Mike wait Mike wait I have one   I think I have one	sd	4
Yes I think I have fourths Mike Mike wait Mike wait I have one   I think I have one	We already tried that one	sd	1
We already tried that one	Im frustrated	sd	1
Im frustrated	I never thought this problem would be this hard	sd	1
You might want to study Andrews model to see what you have to do  to make it bigger	We did  we did two oranges and	sd	4
Right but I want you to make one bigger than that	I can divide it into thirds but I cant divide it into fourths	sd	4
Maybe you gotta make it bigger	Ok lets try to go to thirty	sd	1
Ok lets try to go to thirty	Lets maybe try to go to thirty	sd	1
Lets maybe try to go to thirty	This is  twentyfour we need to make it six more	sd	5
This is  twentyfour we need to make it six more	What is six	sd	3
What is six	One two  you dont really need this anymore	sd	2
One two  you dont really need this anymore	I do	sd	2
I do	You dont really need that one	sd	2
You dont really need that one	Well I have an idea	sd	1
Yeah	Well say we called it thirty	sd	4
Thirty	Yeah um model	sd	1
Yeah um model	Thirty of the  thirty ones and	sd	4
Youre using thirty white ones to make your train is that what youre  telling me	Yeah	b	1
Will it work	No not thirty white ones you would add a six block which would  be I think would be this six  yeah so this is six	sd	5
No not thirty white ones you would add a six block which would  be I think would be this six  yeah so this is six	That  would make thirty and you would call the oranges thirds	sd	5
Would that work	And some of	sd	1
Well try building that and tell me if that works	Ok	b	1
Why dont you try	I also thought of um	sd	1
Would it be easier for  you to put your chair here do you think	Well I was also thinking about the other one	sd	1
Well I was also thinking about the other one	It was um it was um  twice the size of that  Then	sd	4
Hold on lets hear what David says	Then this then the red would be um one twentyfourth the whites  would be I think that would be one fortyeighth	sd	4
Oh so youre saying that if it would be twice the size	And then this  would be one twelfth	sd	4
They have an interesting  David has  an interesting theory I dont know if Meredith heard it tell them his  theory now listen carefully Jackie you want to hear this theory	They  already had a theory I heard it	sd	1
Ok lets hear Davids theory	Well before	sd	1
You know this model gentlemen dont you	Yeah	b	1
Ok Im  ready to listen	Well before we had this other one um where the whites were one  twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth	sd	5
Well before we had this other one um where the whites were one  twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth	But then if we double  that then the reds would be one twentyfourth the whites would be  one fortyeighth and then the light green would be one twelfth	sd	5
Alan is making a face	I just I	sd	1
I just I	No meaning	sd	1
Youre thinking thats possible	I heard what Andrew said was	sd	1
I would suggest that all of you get your blocks together and pick a  spot on the floor over there	But I heard	sd	1
And take some mats	But I overheard Andrews  Andrews doing what hes doin is hes  makin a train for the wholes and he said if you could make a train  for one whole why cant you make a train for the thirds and the  fourths	sd	3
Let me make a suggestion	If you put floormats  on the floor over there by Chris whos running the camera	sd	1
And took all your  hell manage  and take all your rods all your  boxes why dont you try building Davids model and see if it works	Um but	sd	1
Because youll need  the blocks	What was yours before	sd	1
What was yours before	Was it like two blues no	sd	1
Remember what this is though	No one blue one black and um one	sd	4
No one blue one black and um one	No one blue one brown and one black	sd	2
Okay then Arai	Yes	b	1
Okay what did you do	The 50 degree	sd	5
The 50 degree	The line around it	sd	5
The line around it	The line there extend it	sd	5
Did you extend it like this	Bring that over there	sd	5
Bring that over there	Uh 50 degrees	aa	5
Uh 50 degrees	Alternate interior angles of it	sd	5
Alternate interior angles of it	That is 50 degrees so	sd	5
Okay	The right angle is 30 degrees	sd	5
The right angle is 30 degrees	If you add it all up it becomes 180 degrees so	sd	5
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	The top part is 100 degrees	sd	5
The top part is 100 degrees	The one before	sd	5
The one before	A right angle is	aa	5
A right angle is	A right angle is	aa	5
A right angle is	Um it becomes 180 degrees so	sd	5
Not a straight line	A straight line becomes 180 degrees	sd	4
Yes	So X is 80	sd	4
Okay please go ahead	In the middle	sd	4
In the middle	Draw a parallel line	sd	4
Okay	Then	sd	1
Then	Um the top 50 degrees the alternate interior angles of that	sd	4
Yes	It is made there so	sd	1
It is made there so	So its 50 degrees	sd	5
So its 50 degrees	The bottom is 30 degrees	sd	5
The bottom is 30 degrees	It can also be done in the same way	sd	5
It can also be done in the same way	Add those together it becomes 80 degrees	sd	5
One person Chika	Yes	b	1
Okay	Umm from point B	sd	4
Okay	From point B	sd	4
Okay	Is it L	sd	4
From the top line it would be an L huh	To the top straight line draw a perpendicular line	sd	4
To the top straight line draw a perpendicular line	Then	sd	1
Draw a perpendicular line from point B	Then	sd	1
Then	The B area is 60 degrees	sd	5
The B area is 60 degrees	Umm well not really B but between that perpendicular line and 30 degrees is a right angle	sd	5
Umm well not really B but between that perpendicular line and 30 degrees is a right angle	So subtract 30 degrees from 90 degrees	sd	5
Yes	It becomes 60 degrees	sd	4
Yes	The area A is fi fifty degrees so	sd	5
The area A is fi fifty degrees so	Umm the straight line is 180 degrees	sd	5
Right	Angle A becomes 130 degrees	sd	5
Angle A becomes 130 degrees	Since if you add up all of the angles of a quadrilateral it becomes 360 degrees	sd	5
Since if you add up all of the angles of a quadrilateral it becomes 360 degrees	Umm if you add what is this	sd	5
Umm if you add what is this	It becomes 280 degrees	sd	5
It becomes 280 degrees	Eight	sd	5
Eight	Subtract 280 degrees from 360 degrees	sd	5
Subtract 280 degrees from 360 degrees	X became 80 degrees	sd	5
Think a little more	Im thinking	sd	1
Change the middle means	Outside	sd	4
I dont want you to bend it ten times	Eda	sd	1
Eda	Eda difficult	sd	1
You cant just put in any degrees	Do we also write the	sd	1
Please think about how the problem can be understood	A moment	sd	1
A moment	Mmm	sd	1
Mmm	Wait a minute	sd	1
Wait a minute	Um	sd	1
Um	This one too	sd	1
Which one	Huh	b	1
You can put the bends in but does the number fit in is the problem	Isnt it	sd	1
Or you can bend it once twice	Just one	sd	1
Just one	Whichever equals	sd	1
Its been bent too many times	Is this okay for the first one	sd	1
What	Is this okay for the first one	sd	1
You cant solve this	What	ba	1
Without another angle I dont think it cant be solved	What	ba	1
If you try to solve it and you can solve it yourself then it is okay	Isnt it difficult	sd	3
Isnt it difficult	This is difficult	sd	3
This is difficult	If you have finished	sd	1
Where do you solve for this	Hum	sd	1
Where do you solve for this problem	For this it is for this	sd	4
It starts at point A and goes through point B and	Ah I see	sd	1
Ahh it looks hard	This is simple	sd	1
Ahh it is hard	like these	sd	1
like these	Like this	sd	1
This looks hard	This is 90 degrees	sd	4
This is going to be hard	This 65 degrees is last	sd	4
This 65 degrees is last	Eventually if you extend it here is 62	sd	2
Eventually if you extend it here is 62	This is 180 degrees	sd	2
This is 180 degrees	Ah	b	1
Ah	Is this 62 degrees	sd	2
Is this 62 degrees	Here lend it to me	sd	2
Here lend it to me	One hundred twenty	sd	2
One hundred twenty	At 15 you can do it	sd	2
Try hard to make one problem	Understand	sd	1
Understand	Okay	b	1
Is it solvable	You can solve this	sd	4
It is solvable	Yes	b	1
It wont be solvable without these angles here	What	ba	1
What	Add this like this	sd	4
Add this like this	Like this	sd	4
Like this	If you extend it its 60 degrees	sv	4
If you extend it its 60 degrees	This isnt this 60 degrees this like this isnt 60 degrees	sd	4
That doesnt work if this and this are not parallel	If you draw a parallel line	sd	4
If you draw a parallel line	If you draw a parallel line	sd	2
If this and this are not parallel then this angle is not 60 degrees	This angle too cant be used under that assumption	sd	4
If theyre parallel lines then just put in the symbol for parallel lines here	Thank you very much	aa	1
Thank you very much	I dont know if theyll understand this	sd	1
I made it too difficult	Here its hard	sd	1
If you dont make it at most three then it will be impossible	I understand	sd	1
There are problems that cant be solved	How about this one	sd	1
How about this one	This	sd	1

Can you solve this	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	This is well this is really hard	sd	3
Are there any groups that were able to solve them	Plus 15	sd	4
Plus 15	since its 15 degrees so 90	sd	2

We solved this	The rock	sd	1
Well check it later	No at the time at the time I was solving it I was thinking that I couldnt solve it	sd	1
Okay good	Number six is easy so	sd	1
Number six is easy so	There is an even harder one	sd	1
There is an even harder one	This one seems more likely to work out	sd	1
This one seems more likely to work out	I havent gotten this one yet but	sd	1
I havent gotten this one yet but	Its hard	sd	1
Its hard	I just finally got it	sd	1

Do it one more time	I did it once	sd	1
I did it once	A mistake	sd	4
A mistake	Uh I thought it was wrong	sd	2
Group sixs	Group sixs was simple	sd	1
Group sixs was simple	It was very troublesome	sd	1
Okay	Did you do it	qy	1
Return to your desks	Never	sd	1
Never	You can never do this one	sd	1
Okay	Do we have math the day after tomorrow	sd	1
We have math class the day after tomorrow right	The day after tomorrow is Thursday	sd	1
The day after tomorrow is Thursday	Thursday	sd	1
Thursday	Did it change	sd	1
The day after tomorrow is Friday	Huh	b	1
Tuesday	Today is Tuesday	sd	1
Tomorrow	Wednesday	sd	1
Day after tomorrow	Thursday	sd	1
Go ahead	Stand up	sd	1
Stand up	Bow	aa	1
Yeah Mike why don t you come up and explain one right up here and explain it	What number	sd	1
It s your choice not one but two or three or four or five	I ll do number two	sd	1
Uh OK you see where the	For whenever you have a number under the triangle there has to   be a pattern see five and seven the difference is two	sd	5
For whenever you have a number under the triangle there has to   be a pattern see five and seven the difference is two	Five plus two is seven	sd	5
Five plus two is seven	Seven plus two is nine nine plus two is eleven apparently it s two you see here	sd	5
Seven plus two is nine nine plus two is eleven apparently it s two you see here	OK since two and of the first number which is going to be box times two equals no plus something	sd	5
OK since two and of the first number which is going to be box times two equals no plus something	Zero can go into five five times	sd	5
Zero can go into five five times	Yeah whatever so we leave that one out	sd	5
Yeah whatever so we leave that one out	One goes into seven  seven times leave that one out	sd	5
One goes into seven  seven times leave that one out	The two does not go into nine so   take one out to make it eight so we re going to have to have plus   one	sd	5
The two does not go into nine so   take one out to make it eight so we re going to have to have plus   one	So this two goes into eight	sd	5
So this two goes into eight	Two times four is eight plus one is nine so that s nine	sd	5
Two times four is eight plus one is nine so that s nine	The eleven take one away and it s ten but it doesn t go into ten	sd	5
The eleven take one away and it s ten but it doesn t go into ten	So you take one away so you re going to have to take one away from eight so it s going to be seven	sd	5
Matt	It is box times two but it is plus five	sd	4
It is box times two but it is plus five	What s the first number on  the right	sd	3
So he says	Box times two would be fine but then you add five	sd	4
You want to write that	So plus five	sd	4
So plus five	It ll work	sd	4
You all know that	Yeah	b	1
Because if you recall how to determine for example what	Perimeter	sd	4
Perimeter of what	Square	b	4
Perimeter of a square youll be able to remember that yes	Four times A	sd	4
Paul	Four times A	sd	4
If you have this type of figure	Two times A	sd	4
Two times A	Symbol S	aa	2
Thats debatable	The area	sd	4
What are we trying to figure out	The perimeter	sd	4
If were looking for the perimeter then the symbol will be	O	b	4
And you know	O equals two times A plus two times B	sd	4
Nicolie	A to the second power plus B to the second power	sd	4
I think you overdid it with that one wouldnt you say	A to the second power times B	sd	4
Excuse me	Two times A plus B	sd	4
We add A plus B and multiply yes so	By two	sd	4
You also know how to figure out a triangle yes	O equals A plus B plus C	sd	4
Do you have an idea	You somehow draw a square	sd	4
Where	May I come up to the board	sd	1
To what	Secant of circumference	sd	4
Excuse me	Length of the square	sd	4
And what does this blue segment in the circumference mean	Linear equation	aa	4
Michael	Its not accurate	sd	2
Which more accurate method should I use	I would try to divide it into four segments	sd	4
I would try to divide it into four segments	Through center S	sd	4
Through center S and then what once you divide it up	Well in order to find out the radius to know the radius of the circumference I multiply the radius by four	sd	5
Well in order to find out the radius to know the radius of the circumference I multiply the radius by four	When I will have three centimeters times four	sd	5
Well why four times for instance	Because Ill divide it into four pieces	sd	5
Yes	Thats the same thing as if I divided it in eight pieces and that would be the same	sd	3
And there is a lot more of them	Could I draw the square in the inside	sd	4
The diameter in the square is	Diagonal	sd	4
The perimeter in this case the perimeter of a square would be a problem in this case why because you dont know	The lengths	sd	4
So you cannot determine the perimeter of the square	So I would for example use an octagon	sd	4
Where can you easily determine the sides	Triangle	sd	4
What is the length of one side	Radius of the circumference	sd	4
The length of one side of the hexagon is the length of the radius	It still isnt accurate	sd	4
So how would you define it more precisely	Hexahedron	aa	4
Hexahedron	Dodecagon octagon	aa	4
Which one	Dodecagon	b	4
Tetraconiakaioctagon	Would that work	sd	1
You would not be able to figure it out not even the twelfth angle	But more of the angles	sd	4
Six of what	Diameters	sd	4
Diameter and radius	The radius is half of the diameter	sd	4
And the two times R is	Diameter	sd	4
Note the length of the circumference depends on what do you think it depends on	Diameter	sd	4
Do you also remember the equation of that	K equals three	sd	4
What about the actual formula	Y equals K over X	sd	4
Is it going to be four	No No	ba	1
So where is the letter A going to be	Between the two	sd	4
Lets write that instead of K Paul please complete it	Pi pi pi	sd	4
Martin	Half	sd	4
How should I write it up	Two times R	sd	4
Make a note Stanley	Perimeter equals	sd	4
Why are you changing it	Diameter and then I can change it to	sd	4
Yes	We will convert to decimeters	sd	4
I still dont understand the logic of why you switched the numbers	I know it like this	sd	1
One more time	I believe I have to know the diameter	sd	4
You dont know the number of Pi	I know	aa	1
Why dont you choose the numbers	Three point fourteen	sd	4
And how about problem E	You have  that should have been nine point one hundred and six thousandths	sd	4
Do you all understand it	Yes	b	1
You calculated it to the nearest tenth point and the result comes out to 10 numbers so you can round off to approximately	Approximately	sd	1
Thirty	Hundredths	sd	4
Nikolai	Yes	b	1
Think about this one Im seeing a few private thumbs remember that when you and your partner are both ready to share you may share	So I think he meant theres 18 chocolates which doesnt make sense because in total theres 9 cups in all	sd	5
So I think he meant theres 18 chocolates which doesnt make sense because in total theres 9 cups in all	I think he misunderstood the question because he probably thought there were 9 cups of everything	sd	5
I think he misunderstood the question because he probably thought there were 9 cups of everything	Oh	b	5
Oh	And then like 9 cups of cream and then 2 cups  I dont know what he meant but hes wrong	sd	1
What do you think of the diagram	Uh I was going to say what he said	sd	2
Well I know but I didnt hear so can you say it again	I said that she misunderstanded she misunderstood the question just like the first person	sd	2
I said that she misunderstanded she misunderstood the question just like the first person	Because in all theres 9	sd	4
Because in all theres 9	Probably thought like since theres 2 and the problem said 2 cups of chocolate he probably thought every 2 cups theres like 9 cups or something and then thats how you got 2  9  the 18 cups but	sd	5
What would you like to tell us about this one	Because the student thought um misunderstood that the 9 cups was only for the cream so then he multiplied another one because there are two ingredients to get the answer	sd	5
Really loudly so I can hear	He thought that 9 cups is used for 1 ingredient	sd	2
9 cups is used for 1 ingredient	Um for cream	sd	4
Um for cream	And then he multiplied another one for the chocolate and then he got the answer18	sd	5
Would you call on somebody else to to help with why they think that might have happened	Jason	sd	1
Jason	Um because I think that person got it mixed up by thinking that the other times the 2 cups chocolate to the 9 the answer of the in total of 9 cups the answer of 1 cup of cream to the 9 whole to the in total of 9 cups so then he um so he made 27 cups	sd	5
Timothy	Um basically	sd	1
Um basically	If instead of 9 cups in all it would be 27 he would have been right	sd	5
If instead of 9 cups in all it would be 27 he would have been right	He used the 9 in the wrong way	sd	5
He used the 9 in the wrong way	By multiplying the the 9 he multiplied the 2 and the 1 and then add them up	sd	5
By multiplying the the 9 he multiplied the 2 and the 1 and then add them up	So that you get 27	sv	5
So that you get 27	But if in all if he had done that if hed known that there were 27 cups he would have been correct	sd	5
Your name again  thats right Charlotte	Um its basically like the first problem he thought it was 9 cups of each so then it said 2 cups of chocolate so basically he multiplied 1 cup and then he uses 9 cups for cream and then 2 cups of the 9 cups of chocolate	sd	5
And I see I know it begins with an A Ashank	Whoever did the problem they could have like um they could have just added the 2 chocolate the 2 cups of chocolate and the 1 cup of cream which would have equaled 3 and then divided it by 9 which would which would actually for every you would get like 3 since 3  3 is 9 youd get 3 um 3s and for every 3 thered be like 2 cups of chocolate and thered be 1 cup of cream which would have eventually if youd have added up all the 2s you would have gotten  cups of chocolate	sd	5
Okay  he would have gotten what	the cups of chocolate	sd	4
Im not sure I understood you were saying if you added up the 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate	Yes which would have equaled 3	sd	4
So this here  would have been 3 cups	Yes	b	1
Okay	And then for every 3 cups thered be 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream	sd	4
Okay and so for this grouping of 3 heres where you see your 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream	Yes	b	1
Did you have something to add to that	The answer would be to add those two together would equal 3 as he said	sd	5
Uh huh	and you would have to divide it by 9 because thats your number of total and then you would get 3 and thats how many servings he does	sd	5
and you would have to divide it by 9 because thats your number of total and then you would get 3 and thats how many servings he does	Then you need 2 cups of chocolate and every 1 cup of cream you have to multiply like 3 by 2 to get 6	sd	5
Then you need 2 cups of chocolate and every 1 cup of cream you have to multiply like 3 by 2 to get 6	It would be 6 cups of cream	sd	5
What did you want to say Saurabh	What Jason said so then uh like what he said	sd	2
What Jason said so then uh like what he said	There would theres 3 cups 3 cups of the ingredients in the chocolate	sd	5
There would theres 3 cups 3 cups of the ingredients in the chocolate	So then he said that theres 9 cups of the uh ingredients	sd	5
So then he said that theres 9 cups of the uh ingredients	But they he has to divide it by 3 because theres in the first row theres 3 uh	sd	5
In this that Ashank was telling us about	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So then that would equal 3	sd	5
So then that would equal 3	But since theres uh its asking uh how many how many cups of chocolate he used in the recipe they you have to multiply it by 2	sd	5
And Andrew what did you want to add	Basically following Ashank but after he added the 1 cream and 2 chocolates equals 3 he does that keeps doing that until he gets a total of 9	sd	5
Basically following Ashank but after he added the 1 cream and 2 chocolates equals 3 he does that keeps doing that until he gets a total of 9	When he counts up all the chocolates	sd	2
So youre saying we need to do this part	Yeah and then you keep like circling groups of 3 until you get a total of 9	sd	5
Until you get a total of 9	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then you count up all the chocolates and that would be 6 chocolates	sd	5
So thats where you see the 6	Yeah	b	1
Did you want to add onto that Ashank	Well basically my answer was also 6	sd	4
What did you want to say	I agree with Andrew but then um especially the part where he thought based on the 9 cups of the ingredients he multiplied it by 1 cup of cream so and then since each cup of cream theres 2 cups of chocolate so then multiply 2 cups of chocolate by 9 cups of cream so they got 18 cups of chocolate	sd	5
A lot of people are saying they know the secret but they re stuck on a certain problem that s giving them difficulties	I m almost done	sd	1
OK is anybody problem six anybody got six	We know what it is but we can t put it inside the thing	sd	1
We know what it is but we can t put it inside the thing	It keeps going up by two	sd	4
It keeps going up by two	No what s in between goes	sd	2
No what s in between goes	In between like one three five	sd	2
In between like one three five	He means this doesn t go up by two what s in between it goes up by two	sd	2
Oh way hey can you come up let s erase this and come and show us OK	Come on Brian	sd	1
Now this is the microphone here	Hold on he has to come up	sd	1
You got to try and stay out of his way	What should I say what I wrote for number six	sd	1
Yeah yeah	Well I think for six that like numbers aren t really like what s in between well what s in between the numbers is two	sd	5
Well I think for six that like numbers aren t really like what s in between well what s in between the numbers is two	So like so one what s between one and two is well what I mean is what s between two and five is three and what s between five and ten is five	sd	5
So like so one what s between one and two is well what I mean is what s between two and five is three and what s between five and ten is five	Then if when I do all that between one like the numbers in between it goes by two	sd	5
Make sure the camera can see it	Well one between one and three is two between three and five is two between five and seven is two and between seven and nine is two	sd	5
Thank you	Is there an answer for six	sd	3
Im sorry	Is there an answer for six	sd	3
Has anybody figured out the equation for six	We keep getting those stupid fours in the way	sd	1
We keep getting those stupid fours in the way	Negative number	sd	4
OK come and say that to the camera why don t you	This one s ten plus ten that s twenty	sd	5
This one s ten plus ten that s twenty	I didn t figure it out but it has something to do with the prime numbers but	sd	5
OK whoever s going to talk needs the mike who s talking	We re both talking	sd	1
You re both talking	Hes listening	sd	1
You ve got to hold the mike	See um this is how we did it like like you talk	sd	1
See um this is how we did it like like you talk	Whatever the first number is equals the second number	sd	4
Whatever the first number is equals the second number	Whatever number in the box is here	sd	2
Whatever number in the box is here	So we put two in the second one and always one goes here so if this is three three goes here and plus one	sd	5
So we put two in the second one and always one goes here so if this is three three goes here and plus one	See and if it works here three times three would be nine and then the one there would be ten	sd	5
See and if it works here three times three would be nine and then the one there would be ten	So if it s four	sd	2
But you haven t quite really found the formula really	So if it s four we get four and four that equals eight sixteen and then plus one	sd	5
So if it s four we get four and four that equals eight sixteen and then plus one	I think that the secret is that the number in the box always goes always goes next to it	sd	2
That s a really neat idea that s a really neat idea	Is that the secret	sd	1
If you can find a way to write it you ve really got it figured out	So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	sd	5
So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	sd	5
And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red	sd	5
Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length	Im working on that one down here	sd	1
Youre working on that one it looks like youre working on a  bigger model here	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Does that one work	Yup	aa	1
Tell me about that one	Ok the two oranges make the whole	sd	4
Ok	And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	sd	5
And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	And  again if you remove that  it would take  one of those  to fill in the gap so its bigger by one half is  bigger than two fifths by one tenth	sd	5
You seemed to come up with that pretty  quickly	Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	sd	5
Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	So one of those  filled in  the gap	sd	5
So one of those  filled in  the gap	Probably if you used another one  another two you could fill in that with more  purples and using more reds too	sd	5
Interesting	And it could make more	sd	4
Thats an interesting theory could you kind of test that  one out for me and see see if you could build a bigger model	Im trying to build a bigger model	sd	1
If you need more stuff Ive got more rods	I can use from these models	sd	1
Isn t that what you said	This is one whole and then this is one third and this is one half	sd	4
Now if you really  understood what mistake you made here maybe you ll figure out  what mistake you made up there	Well we and we um named well three reds equal up to um one  greens and then you put the purple next to it and you need one more  red you need a red to go next to the purple so it would be one third	sd	5
I am so confused	I don t I still don t think so well because well well see like I said  before when you split the ahh when you split the thirds in half and  they make sixths it s still like	sd	5
Someone has to	See well because when you put it right there you see that you see  that there s one of these if you put one of these on top of it you  might see that that it s that much that that red that red is that much  bigger than one of the halves because one of these reds I m calling  is is is a sixth and anyway a half of one of these a half of one of the  thirds	sd	5
See well because when you put it right there you see that you see  that there s one of these if you put one of these on top of it you  might see that that it s that much that that red that red is that much  bigger than one of the halves because one of these reds I m calling  is is is a sixth and anyway a half of one of these a half of one of the  thirds	But when you put it on top of one of the thirds it s that much  bigger than one of the halves	sd	5
But when you put it on top of one of the thirds it s that much  bigger than one of the halves	Well I think they might both be answers	sd	2
How many of you disagree	I don t think you can have an answer of a third because if you have  one half   and if you take the one half  which would be the dark green you have the one half and then these   are the thirds	sd	5
I don t think you can have an answer of a third because if you have  one half   and if you take the one half  which would be the dark green you have the one half and then these   are the thirds	How could one half be bigger than the  thirds by one third	sd	5
How could one half be bigger than the  thirds by one third	Because and you have the half and the thirds  together that the half is almost as big as two thirds but yet the two  thirds arent exactly are not exactly the green the dark green is not  the dark green is not exactly as big as two two thirds but two thirds  it s the but it s far enough so that the two thirds are not bigger than  it by one third	sd	5
Because and you have the half and the thirds  together that the half is almost as big as two thirds but yet the two  thirds arent exactly are not exactly the green the dark green is not  the dark green is not exactly as big as two two thirds but two thirds  it s the but it s far enough so that the two thirds are not bigger than  it by one third	I kind of agree with Erik	sd	2
I kind of agree with Erik	I think now I disagree with them	sd	2
I think now I disagree with them	I don t really think that if you have this  that you could  have one third bigger than it  because it s got to be one  third and probably a third and a half	sd	5
I don t really think that if you have this  that you could  have one third bigger than it  because it s got to be one  third and probably a third and a half	Yeah he s right	b	2
Yeah he s right	It couldn t be it couldn t be exactly a third	sd	2
It couldn t be it couldn t be exactly a third	Cause one third bigger this would be one third bigger like that to the  end over there	sd	5
Cause one third bigger this would be one third bigger like that to the  end over there	That would actually be like this  this would really be one third bigger  and there s still some left over and there s still about	sd	5
That would actually be like this  this would really be one third bigger  and there s still some left over and there s still about	A half left over	sd	2
A half left over	Yeah there s still there s still one more there s still one more piece  left like about a sixth left	sd	2
Yeah there s still there s still one more there s still one more piece  left like about a sixth left	Cause it s like if you have if you have the like dark green and it  doesn t exactly equal up to it doesn t exactly equal up	sd	5
Cause it s like if you have if you have the like dark green and it  doesn t exactly equal up to it doesn t exactly equal up	It s less than  two thirds but it s more than one third	sd	5
It s less than  two thirds but it s more than one third	It s just about one third and a  half	sd	5
It s just about one third and a  half	So it couldn t be exactly a third bigger than it and it couldn t  be exactly two thirds or it couldn t be exactly one third bigger	sd	5
So it couldn t be exactly a third bigger than it and it couldn t  be exactly two thirds or it couldn t be exactly one third bigger	It  had to be one third and a half	sd	4
Michael wanted to say something for a long time and has been very  patient	Umm I think it should be called one sixth because  because if you put six reds up to one orange  with a red then it would  equal there would be there would be it would be the same size just  so it would be called one sixth because reds like that	sd	5
Umm I think it should be called one sixth because  because if you put six reds up to one orange  with a red then it would  equal there would be there would be it would be the same size just  so it would be called one sixth because reds like that	Yeah I agree with Michael and Erik	sd	2
You thought about the red as being one sixth  to make a half of a third and Michael is saying that red is one sixth	Yeah Michael is right because it takes three sixths to equal one half  and if	sd	5
I see Meredith is wanting to say something	I agree with Erik Michael and Brian because if you do call that a  sixth a sixth and if you put the dark green and two thirds you said  it was you said it was um they said that it s a third bigger if you  did a third bigger this is called a third and then you put it there you  see negative	sd	5
I m sorry Meredith could you start again	You said it was one third bigger that can t be true because one third  bigger	sd	5
You said it was one third bigger that can t be true because one third  bigger	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	It s about one sixth less	sd	5
It s about one sixth less	So it can t be a third bigger	sd	5
So it can t be a third bigger	And also like	sd	1
And also like	So it s one sixth bigger	sd	2
So it s one sixth bigger	And also yeah and also I think because if you have the light green  the light green it s not bigger than it s not bigger than the it s not  bigger than the umm third it s not bigger than two thirds	sd	5
And also yeah and also I think because if you have the light green  the light green it s not bigger than it s not bigger than the it s not  bigger than the umm third it s not bigger than two thirds	It s bigger  than one third but it s not as big as two thirds so it s less than two  thirds but more than one third	sd	5
It s bigger  than one third but it s not as big as two thirds so it s less than two  thirds but more than one third	So it can t be a third bigger	sd	5
So it can t be a third bigger	And if  you have that to make it two thirds large there has to be a sixth	sd	5
Well that is really something uh I think	It s sort of like one sixth in both cases	sd	4
Ariel the rule that you came up with was that you take that number divide by two is that right	Yeah	b	1
So if we divide one hundred and twenty by two what do you get	Sixty	b	4
And then you build that ladder with that many steps	Yeah	b	1
And then you said multiply by two right	Yeah	b	1
Where is that sixty	One hundred and ninetyeight	sd	4
I don t see that one twenty that I told you about	Because this is what I did	sd	1
Because this is what I did	Twenty is the six six times ten is sixty	sd	5
Twenty is the six six times ten is sixty	That would be the two hundred	sd	5
Six times what	Six times ten is sixty	sd	5
Hmm hmm	Two hundred is right here then I subtracted two and make it one ninety eight and so sixty is one ninety eight	sd	5
You are saying that sixty is one twenty eight	No one ninety eight	sd	4
And how did you get that one ninety eight for sixty	I did twenty which would be six steps is twenty rods	sd	5
I did twenty which would be six steps is twenty rods	Six times ten is sixty so twenty rods times ten is two hundred and through my rule you subtract it by two to get one ninety eight and then	sd	5
Up to here you are getting the number for sixty right	This is sixty	sd	4
Six is an even number right	Yeah yeah yeah	b	1
So did you do the same rule of dividing by two	Yeah I divide one twenty by two and got sixty	sd	5
OK you go ahead	You are wrong right there because	sd	4
QuicklyOK	OK	b	1
So we can look at the rule that you have here I am really looking for a rule that can help me figure out	Should I write this whole thing here	sd	1
Yeah	Done	b	1
Right Ariel	My rule is right	aa	4
So we know for how many rods for the ladder for one twenty eight steps	Here we go half as sixty yah yah	sd	5
Here we go half as sixty yah yah	Six times ten is sixty ahh ahh	sd	5
Six times ten is sixty ahh ahh	For six steps equals too many rods and then six times ten is sixty so two hundred and	sd	5
Where is the ladder with sixty steps	I didn t do that	sd	1
I didn t do that	It is too much	sd	1
It is too much	I shortened it by dividing sixty by ten it gives me six	sd	5
I shortened it by dividing sixty by ten it gives me six	Since I had already done six six times ten is sixty so I just did the number rods for sixty times ten	sd	5
Since I had already done six six times ten is sixty so I just did the number rods for sixty times ten	So that I didn t have to make a big ol  ladder	sd	5
Did you subtract by two	What	ba	1
Here did you subtract by two	It is right here	aa	1
This is   One ninety eight is what again	The sixty	sd	4
I see	What s this	ba	1
What s this	Ohh I put nine	sd	4
Ohh I put nine	That s two that s supposed to be a two my bad	sd	4
Raphaela	No	b	1
Try to express your problem	Well there is a minus there	sd	4
This one	Yes	b	1
Now what about that minus sign	Well doesnt it mean something	sd	3
Has your question been answered or not quite yet	Well one could also just calculate without the bracket	sd	4
Tomi	Well just go ahead and calculate instead of  do the intermediate step	sd	4
How do you mean that	Well simply calculate minus three A X plus two B Y now and then leave the brack bracket	sd	4
Samuel	Three U plus four V	sd	4
Yes Samuel	Six X Y plus four X Y and minus seven A A B plus three A B	sd	5
What is the common expression that I will factorize Philipp	Two A minus five B	sd	4
Now how does the content of the second bracket develop Philipp	Seven M minus five N and minus three N mi minus two N	sd	5
Equals Benjamin what do we get	Hm two X squared minus one times nine Y	sd	4
And also	Thanks	b	1
Mhm yes	Do you have to indicate the factorizing at the rear	sd	1
No thats a transformation the two terms are absolutely equal	Minus in brackets	sd	4
Minus in brackets	Hm what	ba	3
Hm what	Minus in brackets	sd	4
I dont have it yet	Mhm yes	aa	1
Under what circumstances can	Actually it should be a zero there too	sd	4
Well then write it down From one of the two  thats a special case	Maam is that right	sd	1
I dont know if thats a beneficial beginning	Cant you do that	sv	1
Do it first in your notebook	Yees	aa	1
Hm then it gets problematic right because youve got X squared and X	How con you solve this	sd	3
If we pose this question in connection with factorizing maybe factorizing could help us along the track	Can this be right	sd	1
That can very possibly be right	what I have to do	sd	1
Five cannot be zero Barbara	Is it correct now like that	sd	1
Hmm well it is correct but how do you continue now	Well thats actually what I was going to ask about	sd	3
Well thats actually what I was going to ask about	Cant one the X over there well minus 25 on this side	sd	5
Cant one the X over there well minus 25 on this side	then its minus 25 over there then there is still that bracket over there and then divide by this bracket on this side	sd	5
But you have got the X twice in there	Yes thats just it	sv	1
Well then	If you calculate that it becomes X to the second power again	sd	5
Look Raphaela you still have a sum	Thats just it	sd	1
Esti	Of a binomial formula	sd	4
What is it this expression	What which which case	sd	1
Yes	The third	sd	4
Mh not sure	I dont know the number I mean	sd	1
How can it be factorized that was my original question Michelle	X plus five to the power of two	sd	4
This square is zero how do we continue Anette	If one number times a number is zero or a term times a term is zero then one or both of them has to be zero	sd	5
If one number times a number is zero or a term times a term is zero then one or both of them has to be zero	And as both are the same X is plus five equals zero	sd	5
This square can only be zero if X plus five is zero which means that X has to have what value Klaus	Hm does X have to be minus five	sd	1
Okay well you can do a little mental calculation right	You know yesterday I calculated  11 times 11 as basic area	sd	4
Eleven times 11 equals	One hundred and twentyone	sd	4
Eleven times what equals 121	Eleven	sd	4
Mmh yes	Is this correct like that	sd	1
Hoho they are	something like that eh and then minus 14 14	sd	4
something like that eh and then minus 14 14	Is that correct	sd	1
There is just one trifle missing it has to be equal	Oh and then its correct	sd	1
Thats true yes well done	Is X 11	sd	4
X is 11 in the second one look I covered it at the front	Ah	b	1
Some of you have already solved the third one Shane move on	Thats the third one it says A plus B and A minus B	sd	4
Mmh yes	Ehm is X	sd	4
One hundred and nine sixtynine	One hundred and sixtynine	sd	4
One of them is zero or the other thus X minus 14 must be zero or second variant Benjamin	X plus 14 has to be zero	sd	4
X plus 14 has to be zero and that will give us for X the two solutions	Fourteen or minus 14	sd	4
Hansueli asked a question can one write it down as a solution set and if so how	Well eh solution set equals ehm minus 14 and then well ehm yes	sd	4
Semi semicolon	Yes semicolon and then 14	sd	4
I will list them the two solutions	You cant really see it anymore	sd	1
Anette	Now could one just write absolute solution value 14	sd	4
Pardon	Could one a little there	sd	1
I just dont want to show the solution yet	Could you show that in the back there once again	sd	1
Now you have to finish the calculation Marc	Then X equals minus three point three	sd	4
How can you proceed in order to get six X squared in the product	Well three and two right	sd	4
There you somehow have to make a decision you have to try it out	Mhm yes	aa	1
In the last place it has to be a three	Mhm yes	aa	1
If you have the number of three here then you take two X to the right	Minus two X	sd	4
Minus or just two X equals plus three	Well then ask her	sd	1
That would be one variant yes	six X and there X and three X and two X two X are three	sd	5
You just wrote it the other way around	Well yes but but well somehow it has to be the other way around can it partially be too	sd	4
Basically the two possibilities stand open	Yes	b	1
And to find what is correct you ascertain that using the middle term afterwards	Mhm yes	aa	1
How can you get the product minus three with integers for now	Plus three times minus one	sd	4
How can I recognize if one of these four solutions is the correct one Samuel	Well it I have to obtain seven X	sd	4
Minus six plus three equals Hansueli	Minus three X	sd	4
Jeanine	Mmh  X	sd	1
Six times three X six X times three	Eighteen	sd	4
And	Minus o well one	sd	4
There are Corinne	Nine X	sd	4
Nine X and what else	Minus one X	sd	4
Three X times minus one is	Two X	sd	4
Pay attention dont be nervous	Six X	sd	4
Nine X	Ehm nine X minus eh two X equals seven X	sd	5
Now Ive got six X squared plus seven X minus three	Two	sd	4
Hansueli	Ehm three X plus one and the second bracket two X minus three	sd	4
Lets multiply everything properly once again	Ehm six X squared	sd	4
Six X squared	Ehm minus nine X	sd	4
Minus nine X	Two X	sd	4
Plus two X and	Minus three	sd	4
Shall I put it up for you to see once more	Yes could you	sd	1
Yes could you	Yes please	sd	1
Should anybody still have questions then raise your hand now so that I can pass by	What problems do we have to do now 14	sd	1
They are all equations that you have to solve	Well the	sd	1
The solutions are there in the front as usual you can check if your results are correct or not	Eh youre standing right in my way	sd	1
Yes	Do I have to  number 11  now	sd	1
What do you mean	Ehm now	aa	1
Ehm now	I have	sd	1
But for what we are trying out right now	Yes eh	sd	1
Its 14A 15B and 17B actually 16 too	Yes	b	1
Homework was all right	Hmm yes I continued a little bit there	sd	1
When you have solved some already Christoph you can just as well go and check your answers in the solution booklet if they are correct	Mhm yes	aa	1
Its laying in the front	Mhm yes	aa	1
Mhm well it is actually all about recognizing the binomial formulas	Yes yes	b	1
Yes yes	then eh yes  X minus three	sd	4
then you will need a whole page only for one problem and wont be able to keep the overview anymore or everything will become too big	Yes sure	aa	1
Thats correct	Is that right	aa	1
Yes	See	aa	1
See	Mrs  could you please come	sd	1
Its just a little bit strange that you always take your X to the right when you write it	Yes I did it differently this time	sd	1
You can be original if you like	I always do it like that	sd	1
Yes	Yes then this should be that or that and there are these two solutions right	sd	1
Yes then this should be that or that and there are these two solutions right	But Hansueli has a completely different solu	sd	2
No he is working on 14	Ah yes we just had to do the three listed in the front right	sd	1
And look if you want to write it in short form you can of course just list it after your consideration	Mhm yes	aa	1
Well why dont you do it then	Yes	b	1
Yes	I dont know	sd	1
Five sixth yes correct	Should I write seven minus X	sd	4
Should I write seven minus X	You dont know where the minus could be	sd	4
A	That one D	sd	1
Eh D It has to be X squared	But	sd	1
If X minus seven is zero then X is seven and if seven minus X is zero then X is also seven	Mhm yes	aa	1
See it doesnt matter in which order you write it	Ehm does it matter which one I do first	sd	1
Now do you mean at the listing	Yes	b	1
Do you know	Then its still correct like that	sd	1
One can imagine it directly on the number line that way	Yes	b	1
Thats the advantage hm but	How do I have to do this now	sd	1
One hundred and fortyfour is the square of what number	Of 24	sd	4
Of 24	No	b	1
Eleven times 11 we saw before and whats next	Twelve times 12	sd	4
Thats not necessary	Oh yes	b	1
Thats not necessary	There is no square number here in number E	sd	4
There is no square number here in number E	E	b	4
E	E	b	2
E Two X and three in the back doesnt that work out	Ah two X times eh plus three	sd	4
For tomorrow please just do this first problem 14 A	The whole thing	sd	1
It goes fast	No	b	1
Did you solve the wrong one	No I did two F and the next two	sd	1
What else	Is that right in the brackets there	sd	1
Is that right in the brackets there	Because that is they skipped it just like that	sd	1
Because that is they skipped it just like that	It is not finished yet I know but	sd	1
But now there is no A plus B anymore there in the back	Goodbye everyone	sd	1
You factorized A plus B here	Mhm yes	aa	1
Nine X plus eight X minus that but it is thats that	Is that minu is that minus or	sd	4
Thats that	that it becomes a minus	sd	4
Right	Yes I just wanted well	sd	1
Yes I just wanted well	Situation 5 is  This test was very difficult for most people	sd	1
Situation 5 is  This test was very difficult for most people	Our group felt that it was pretty good match because when it says its most difficult and then we checked it the highest score is mostly in the lowest score while little bit to no people got the highest score of 90 or 100 percent	sd	5
Our group felt that it was pretty good match because when it says its most difficult and then we checked it the highest score is mostly in the lowest score while little bit to no people got the highest score of 90 or 100 percent	According to me its approximately 42 people got a 20 to 30 percent score	sd	4
According to me its approximately 42 people got a 20 to 30 percent score	Some people got low scores but most people but some people could do everything	sd	4
Some people got low scores but most people but some people could do everything	Everything	sd	1
Everything	Uh like like some people got like low scores and like there was like some people got like everything right	sd	4
Uh like like some people got like low scores and like there was like some people got like everything right	Like one or two	sd	4
Like one or two	What I was thinking that it doesnt work because its little to no people not because some people might be like more than because its real   its more real to have 100 percent on histogram F while the lowest scores from 20 to 30 theres a bunch of people that has a low score	sd	5
What I was thinking that it doesnt work because its little to no people not because some people might be like more than because its real   its more real to have 100 percent on histogram F while the lowest scores from 20 to 30 theres a bunch of people that has a low score	I think that	sv	1
I think that	I think that the situation you gave fits more to histogram A because um histogram A shows no people getting scores of 70 to 80 or higher and so that means that everybody got a very low sco or a low score whereas in um histogram F a few people got a score that was 70 to 80 80 to 90 90 to 100	sd	5
I think that the situation you gave fits more to histogram A because um histogram A shows no people getting scores of 70 to 80 or higher and so that means that everybody got a very low sco or a low score whereas in um histogram F a few people got a score that was 70 to 80 80 to 90 90 to 100	Yes	b	1
It looks like youre using the light greens and reds David	What I did was light greens were one half and the reds are one  third and the dark green was one whole	sd	4
So  when you go to compare them how do you do that	Well I made a balance to see which was bigger	sd	4
Ok do you want me to let you get your balance together and  then Ill come back	Ill get it together soon	sd	1
Ok	dark green	sd	1
dark green	Youd use two light  cubes  to make one half of it and then you take three reds and youd  have one third of it	sd	5
Interesting	And then we found a different way if you balance it and you put  two greens on one side and three reds on the other side and they  balance	sd	5
And then we found a different way if you balance it and you put  two greens on one side and three reds on the other side and they  balance	Its hard to make it balance	sd	1
So youre making it balance sort of like Davids doing but its a  little different	Oh I know how to do this	sd	1
Oh I know how to do this	I know	aa	1
I know	One half would be this big  and one third would be this big	sd	4
How much bigger is   by how  much	Id say one unit	sd	4
Is there a way you could prove it	It is one half of one third	sd	4
Well what number  name can we give this if we had to give it actual fraction names  well how did you find that this is a third and this is a half	First we say how many equal one third of the green and that was  two so we knew that was a half	sd	5
First we say how many equal one third of the green and that was  two so we knew that was a half	And then and then it might not  work unless there is something of three that first on the dark  green and that would be the red cause you can fit three	sd	5
Would that work	Yeah	b	1
Go ahead Sarah	One sixth one sixth	sd	4
Ok you say that very uncertainly but why do you think that	It is six and it makes up to the green block	sd	4
Ok so what is  the difference between a half and a third	A half is much larger than a third	sd	4
Which is what number name	One sixth	sd	4
Put your names on it and the date	Lets draw pictures	sd	1
And the date	First we can draw this balance then this  first draw this  because this is the thing that she wants us to do	sd	1
First we can draw this balance then this  first draw this  because this is the thing that she wants us to do	Im not going to be exact	sd	1
Im not going to be exact	It is not a perfect fit	sd	1
Ok that is a good point is there another solution to this	Ill do a seesaw	sd	1
Ok while you are working on that Meredith David will show  me this	This is what I did on Friday and the dark green will be the  whole thing and the light green with be the half	sd	4
The whole thing what number name is that	Umm thatd be one	sd	4
Ok	And the red would be one third	sd	5
And the red would be one third	What I did before when I was  ready I took off two of the red and one of the the light green	sd	5
Well why did you take off two of these off	Well because then there is only one piece	sd	5
Well because then there is only one piece	I thought it would  fall to the right	sd	5
I thought it would  fall to the right	And on Friday thats what happened	sd	5
Did you want to try it	I am not sure if it will because of these two pieces	sd	5
I remember when you  did this on Friday	Because I have more support and you probably need it a little  wobbly to fall	sd	5
So then can I ask you which is bigger a half or a third	A half	sd	4
Maybe you can help me	If you but another rod theres going to be cutting it there and  another rod there and cutting this one in half and taking this off  breaking this in half and put one on this it would be the same	sd	5
If you but another rod theres going to be cutting it there and  another rod there and cutting this one in half and taking this off  breaking this in half and put one on this it would be the same	But since we but it here and here its not the same	sd	5
What would be a good number name for that	Um maybe	sd	1
Or could we go back and figure out what the number name  would be for that	If this was the whole think like one then this could be three fourths	sd	5
Remember this is how much of  the bar	This is a half	sd	4
The question is can we come up with a  number name for the difference between a half and a third	Lets see maybe  we could do something like uh	sd	1
It really is something to think about it because it must have a  number name	Like 15 or something	sd	4
Why dont the three of you  come over here pull your chair over here Brian	Well we got two answers	sd	1
Ok I want to hear about this	Well she didnt have enough	sd	1
Who would like to share	Well first we got this one	sd	5
Well first we got this one	This would be one half and this  would be one third and that would be one third	sd	5
Hold up one half and one third	One half and one third	sd	4
And how do you know that	Cause you take  cause this these two that isone half if that  green  ad so is that	sd	5
Cause you take  cause this these two that isone half if that  green  ad so is that	So and then that would be one of the  halfs and this is all one thirds of it	sd	5
So and then that would be one of the  halfs and this is all one thirds of it	And this would be one of  the thirds	sd	5
Ok and Brian you worked on both of these two can you  explain this model to me	Well this is  I have to put this together  this was the whole  candy bar	sd	4
Ok	And this would be the half and this would be the third	sd	5
And this would be the half and this would be the third	And uh  the third is smaller and the half is bigger	sd	5
And uh  the third is smaller and the half is bigger	The third is smaller  because if you have to make three of them  you ah veto make  to make it a third you have to have three of them in one you  have to have three of them in one whole but there is less room  for three of them so you and you have more room for a half so  half would be bigger	sd	5
Oh ok	Yeah thats what we got two this would be the whole and that  would be the half and that would be the third	sd	2
Do you think you  could remember them because we are probably going to have to  turn in an assignment	Could we just draw something	sd	1
We are just about out of time but if you  want to maybe start it if you want to jot down an idea	Could we trace them and color it	sd	1
Yeah if you want to trace them thats fine	I have another model I have another model to show which one  is bigger	sd	5
I have another model I have another model to show which one  is bigger	If you put one red one there and a green one there and  then you put an orange rod	sd	5
If you put one red one there and a green one there and  then you put an orange rod	It goes up because this is larger	sd	5
What would be the number difference  between those two between the half and the third	If you take off the one it would be a difference of two ones	sd	5
If you take off the one it would be a difference of two ones	But when you take but if you take this one off  two of these  and one of these off	sd	5
There is definitely a difference there you can see it	And then its a difference of two	sd	4
I am confused I  thought you were calling this one	And then probably we would call this we would call that sixths	sd	4
And then probably we would call this we would call that sixths	One sixth	sd	4
What would we call that	A difference of two sixths	sd	4
I heard one sixth and I heard two  sixts and I want to know before I go then what it is	Like I said if you would  separate  em	sd	5
Like I said if you would  separate  em	And you gave one of these one of these and two more kids then youd have more	sd	5
And you gave one of these one of these and two more kids then youd have more	You sure would	aa	2
Right but if now I took it away again then what would be the  number name for the difference	One in each handful one in each third	sd	4
What is the number name for  that I forgot what are we calling the white block	Um one sixth	sd	4
Um one sixth	Because theres two one sixths	sd	5
Because theres two one sixths	I was calling this one sixth because six of these add up to one  one whole	sd	5
I was calling this one sixth because six of these add up to one  one whole	And if you only had one sixth if you said it was only sixth then  you wouldnt have one for that	sd	5
And if you only had one sixth if you said it was only sixth then  you wouldnt have one for that	So it has to be two sixths	sd	5
What if the question is through that instead of asking you to  look at the whole candy bar then I am just asking you to  compare the amounts of a half and a third of the candy bar	One half	sd	5
One half	Then the difference would be one sixth for each half	sd	5
Make up a problem	Two yellows	sd	4
Just one problem you and your partner make together	No let s make it harder	sd	1
See if you can trick me or trick Amy	Yeah look at this	sd	1
And if if if you and your  partner may have made up or your partners have made a problem  when you think you have one be careful how you re gonna ask it  practice how you re gonna ask the problem and then raise your  hand	No that s one fifth	sd	4
No that s one fifth	I know	aa	1
I know	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	We re out of reds	sd	1
We re out of reds	We re out of reds	sd	1
We re out of reds	Oh well	ba	1
Try to get a hard one and try to stump us	Yes I got it	sd	1
Yes I got it	No those won t make it	sd	2
No those won t make it	What makes thirds	sd	3
What makes thirds	Thirds thirds out of a thirds out of this	sd	2
Thirds thirds out of a thirds out of this	Probably the greens	sd	4
Probably the greens	Light green	sd	2
Light green	Light green would make thirds out of the orange	sd	5
Light green would make thirds out of the orange	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	No it wouldn t	sd	2
No it wouldn t	No it doesn t	sd	2
No it doesn t	Try it	sd	1
Try it	Then what does	sd	3
Then what does	I know what makes thirds	sd	1
I know what makes thirds	What	ba	3
What	There s got to be one	sd	1
Oh this is an interesting one	Which one makes thirds	sd	3
Which one makes thirds	What makes	sd	1
This would be an interesting problem what would you ask  me here Alan	If if the red rod was considered one fifth what	sd	4
Okay good problem	No but what makes it	sd	3
No but what makes it	Nothing can divide twelve into thirds except	sd	4
Nothing can divide twelve into thirds except	Red	sd	2
Red	No	b	2
No	Two  four six eight ten	sd	5
Two  four six eight ten	Ten divided into thirds	sd	5
Ten divided into thirds	No ten can t be divided  into thirds	sd	5
No ten can t be divided  into thirds	But nine can	sd	2
But nine can	Nine can but there is no nine rod	sd	2
Nine can but there is no nine rod	Oh yeah there is	aa	1
Oh yeah there is	Eleven this is twelve though	sd	4
Eleven this is twelve though	No it isn t look	sd	2
No it isn t look	The orange rod is ten	sd	5
The orange rod is ten	So that s ten this must be nine	sd	5
So that s ten this must be nine	And this divided into thirds must be	sd	4
And this divided into thirds must be	It takes green	sd	4
It takes green	Light green	sd	2
Light green	It takes green to divided the orange into thirds	sd	5
It takes green to divided the orange into thirds	Blue	sd	2
Blue	No we are doing this one	sd	1
No we are doing this one	I m doing this one the one I made up	sd	1
I m doing this one the one I made up	I m doing this one	sd	1
I m doing this one	Yeah	b	1
Im ready to hear some questions because you can maybe  keep thinking of more	I got one	sd	4
Are you all ready to listen to the questions	Oh mine is hard	sd	1
And hopefully well get around	No one will get mine	sd	1
Alan you want to come up here  and ask us and build it again	If one red rod was considered one fifth what would a whole be  considered	sd	3
That s really a hard question	If the red rod would be one fifth what would one what would one  be	sd	3
If the red rod would be one fifth what would one what would one  be	Me	sd	1
If the red rod was one fifth what would we call one	The orange rod	sd	4
Nice and loud Erik	No he called on Graham	sd	1
No he called on Graham	The orange rod	sd	4
Oh Graham	The orange rod	sd	4
Can you prove it	Five red ones make up an orange rod	sd	5
And Mark has one  right after that so why dont you come up too Mark and you can  both ask together and help each other find them	If the if the green was a whole what would a blue be	sd	3
That was  the question	Three wholes	sd	4
Nice and loud Erik	Three wholes	sd	4
I think we don t have enough light green	Oh I have some light greens	sd	1
Can you imagine it	Transparent	sd	1
Yeah	Transparent ones	sd	1
Laura	I built it on my desk	sd	1
Ah because Mark has another one to ask  you go ahead Mark	If if the blue was one whole what would the green be considered	sd	3
Light green right	Yes	b	1
Yes	One third	sd	4
One third	Because umm these if the if you an put them up to the side  there ll be three and you put a one and it ll be one third	sd	5
A hard  one	Oh I have a hard one	sd	1
Uh oh a hard one	If the white one was one whole what would um the orange be	sd	3
If we call the white rod one what number name would we give to  the orange	Ten wholes or ten	sd	4
And and how would you how would you convince me	Well if you took the orange block you d and you took white ones  you d need just only ten well	sd	5
You understand the question if I m calling  the orange rod one what number name would I give to the white  rod	Oh I know it I know it	sd	1
Oh I know it I know it	I know it I know it	sd	1
Okay Jacquelyn you tell us	One tenth	sd	4
Why one tenth	Because if you line them up on the side and add them all up it will  be ten	sd	5
So if you add up one tenth up how many times would you be  adding one tenth	Ten times	sd	4
Okay wow what a what a smart class	I have a hard one	sd	1
We only have a few minutes	If you if I called purple is this purple	sd	1
If you if I called purple is this purple	If I called purple a half if I  called the purple a half what would a whole be	sd	3
Okay if purple were one half what would one be	Umm a brown	sd	4
Youre really getting to know  these	I would take I took I tried it and I took a purple and tried to match  up all the rods up to the purple and then I took another one cause  the brown  the look the brown looked half the purple looked half  the other brown so I took another purple and it was a whole	sd	5
Um well um Meredith its so  good to see you back and Meredith is probably  curious to know what we did and since you were able  to write to us to tell us what you did we have some  information Michael what did you want to say	Well weve been working with bows and discussing  like um well the length the how many bows we could  fit into a certain amount of meters if the bow took up a  certain amount of ribbon	sd	5
Well weve been working with bows and discussing  like um well the length the how many bows we could  fit into a certain amount of meters if the bow took up a  certain amount of ribbon	And uh we were recently  doing thirds and uh we we got we got like stuff like we  came up with like you times nine times three or  something like that to get answers	sd	5
Is a meter  longer than the width of this room	No	b	1
Is it shorter than the width of this room	Yes	b	1
Is a meter about the length of this chalkboard	No	b	1
Is it bigger	No	b	1
Is it smaller	Yes	b	1
Caitlin	I think its about this big	sv	4
Is that going to be too long  or too short do you think	A little short	sd	4
What do you think Brian	Yeah its a little its going to be a little short	sd	4
Graham	You double it	aa	4
Werent you also working on that  Gregory out in the hall with your yeah and can you  tell us can you tell the class something that would  give you an idea of the length of three meters nine  meters	Well just uh if like eight meters plus one meter	sd	4
But if you had to tell someone here is like part of the  school about nine meters	Oh I guess maybe probably as big as the chalkboard  or a little bigger	sd	4
Oh I guess maybe probably as big as the chalkboard  or a little bigger	Probably like from the chalkboard  from the end of the chalkboard to Danielle	sd	4
Probably like from the chalkboard  from the end of the chalkboard to Danielle	No	b	2
You measured out something in the  hallway	Oh I know we measured the hallway	sd	4
You measured the hallway and what did you find the  length of the hallway to be	Twentyseven meters	sd	4
What do you think  Danielle	I think its bigger than	sv	4
How many of you think that its  smaller	Because this is eight meters	sd	5
How do you know that	Because we measured it	sd	5
Because we measured it	When we were measuring the school	sd	2
And you remember that	Yes	b	1
What  do you think	Well it would be about from the chalkboard to there	sd	4
From the chalkboard to whom	Graham	sd	4
That would be  about nine meters	No	b	2
You think its too big too small	Too small	sd	4
The width of the  classroom	Both	sd	4
Both	Its eight by eight	sd	4
Its eight by eight	Its eight by eight	sd	2
It happens to be an eight by eight classroom	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Brian	Twentyseven meter hall comes to this hall coming  down here its about from the door to um to the  middle of to when you start going down there	sd	4
David	I was going to say that um to the door the outside  door down to where you take a right	sd	4
Oh so all the way where the interseT2ion is where you  can make a right Danielle	If you go right to the bathroom then you will go up	sd	4
If you go into the bathroom ok thats very interesting  Michael	Also I think about the width of it is like a little bit away  from the wall and there um and all then to that wall	sd	4
So if we started at that wall how much out of the  classroom would we have to go to get nine meters	One meter	sd	4
What was that	It was multiplying nine times three and you get  twentyseven	sd	5
And you you took the one third meter and  you counted them how many of them when you  counted them up	You had well you had three	sd	4
Three for each meter so for nine meters you had	Um you had nine	sd	4
You had the three nine times	Yeah	b	1
Yeah how did you do that	You put the number down three times and you  counted	sd	4
One two three four five six seven eight nine is that  right	Three	sd	4
That added up to  Audra  We did the three three times and we added it up to  nine	We did the three three times and we added it up to nine	sd	5
Remember that Erik	Yes	b	1
So we now have to help the people  who arent sure  no one thinks smaller	Come to think of it you could have you could have  three bows well I mean you could have each bow  thats three meters long and you can have one bow  that you have to twist and everything using three  meters of ribbon making it small and just like twisting it  every which way	sd	5
So the question  is if I make my bows to be like this would my one  third meter bows that Im making for my nine meters  be smaller or bigger than my three meter bows that  Im making from my nine meter ribbon	The one third meter bow would probably be smaller  unless you had two different kinds of ribbon	sd	4
But were not though were keeping them the same	But if you did then you could make this the three  meters really complicated bows so it is going to be  very little and that one basically	sd	5
What do you think Brian	It would be in thirds	sd	4
Ok so can you can you sort of tell me where one of  the first cuts would be if I rolled this ribbon on the floor  and it went out the room	Um on three meters	sd	4
Audra	Um on six meters	sd	4
Is there a third cut	No	b	1
Erin	Three	sd	4
Ok so how many bows will I make	Three	sd	4
Is it going to be  more than nine meters	Yes	b	1
Its going to go past that hallway you  think	Mmm hmm	sd	1
Now Im making my bows a half a  meter in length	A half meter	sd	4
Two parts	Because half of 12 is 6	sd	5
Because half of 12 is 6	You are not  paying attention	sd	1
You are not  paying attention	We have it	sd	1
How	Because we talked about it	sd	1
Because we talked about it	Oh yeah because you double it	aa	5
To the entire class If you solved that one also solve  the inaudible	I just made inaudible	sd	1
To the entire class If you think you have a way of getting those answers if you found a secret on how to do it I would like to know what the secret is	2 meters is six	sd	4
2 meters is six	6 is 3 times 12	sd	5
6 is 3 times 12	It s 3 times 12	sd	5
It s 3 times 12	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Both Andrew and James write down 31236  And now 6 inaudible is just 2	sd	5
Both Andrew and James write down 31236  And now 6 inaudible is just 2	So 6 meters equals to  inaudible 13 equals and 1 2 equals no 2 equals and  half equals 2 inaudible	sd	5
So 6 meters equals to  inaudible 13 equals and 1 2 equals no 2 equals and  half equals 2 inaudible	We got 24	sd	2
Okay the next one	We got 6	sd	4
Walks over to Beth What did you  guys get for the next one	We are trying to we are thinking	sd	1
We are trying to we are thinking	We got 24 and 6	sd	4
Brian is drawing models to show his reasoning	Jessica 12 meter got inaudible for one half meter bows	sd	4
Jessica 12 meter got inaudible for one half meter bows	We  got	sd	1
We  got	What did we get	sd	3
What did we get	Laura answers Oh yeah 24  for half meter bows right	aa	4
Laura answers Oh yeah 24  for half meter bows right	So we have 24 for half  meter ones	sd	4
So we have 24 for half  meter ones	So we got 2 meter bows for  how many  meters do we have	sd	3
James is writing down his explanation	See the meters bows are going to be half meters	sd	4
See the meters bows are going to be half meters	So  they can t be 2	sd	4
So  they can t be 2	Say this was inaudible	sd	1
Say this was inaudible	It s not I know that	sd	1
It s not I know that	You  divide it in to half	sd	4
You  divide it in to half	You have two pieces	sd	4
You have two pieces	Do you know  what I mean	sd	1
Do you know  what I mean	You are not going to have 24	sd	4
You are not going to have 24	But you have TWELVE meters	sd	2
But you have TWELVE meters	So you have to divide  each meter in half	sd	4
Right	Oh I thought you meant one	sd	4
Do you change  your mind	Yeah because I thought you meant divide the whole  thing  into two	sd	4
So do you agree	Yes	b	1
Is that clear now	Yes	b	1
Okay now tell me how many 23 meter bows you can  make from 12 meters of ribbon	The fourth one would be 12	sd	4
The fourth one would be 12	Wait we didn t get the third one	sd	2
Wait we didn t get the third one	Third is you have to get 13 meters inaudible	sd	2
Third is you have to get 13 meters inaudible	Twelve times six right	sd	4
Twelve times six right	I got it	sd	1
I got it	You have to try	sd	1
You have to try	12  times 6 inaudlbe	sd	4
12  times 6 inaudlbe	This is the rule inaudible half	sd	5
This is the rule inaudible half	So there will be two	sd	5
So there will be two	No	b	2
Maybe Meredith is having difficulty because now  she has to divide by a number that is not a whole  number	Yes	b	2
Yes	So  you can only cut it in half so inaudible	sd	4
So  you can only cut it in half so inaudible	36	b	2
36	No wait	sd	1
No wait	I could do these	sd	1
I could do these	8 times 2 is 16	sd	5
8 times 2 is 16	76 and  twelve   So 7612 is 88	sd	5
76 and  twelve   So 7612 is 88	What are you doing	sd	3
What are you doing	We are making 12 meters	sd	4
How did you do that	I put each meter together	sd	5
I put each meter together	Well twelve is an even  number	sd	5
Well twelve is an even  number	You can make two s out of it	sd	5
You can make two s out of it	If I put two s  together I count two four six eight ten and twelve	sd	5
If I put two s  together I count two four six eight ten and twelve	If  you put them together you only get six	sd	5
To Danielle Do you know inaudible the same thing	I made these	sd	1
So what about 13  meters	I did that right	sd	4
I did that right	Oh	b	1
Oh	So each meter	sd	1
So each meter	No I didnt say	sd	1
No I didnt say	I said you count	sd	4
I said you count	Six twelve  counting two times	sd	4
Six twelve  counting two times	One second	sd	1
One second	You said you inaudible each inaudible  six	sd	2
You said you inaudible each inaudible  six	Yes	b	2
Yes	No	b	1
No	Wait say that again	sd	3
Wait say that again	That s what you said about the half	sd	2
That s what you said about the half	No	b	2
No	I said inaudible	sd	1
I said inaudible	counting 36	sd	4
counting 36	This will be 6 and we will make another one down  here	sd	4
This will be 6 and we will make another one down  here	That is one third	sd	5
That is one third	So there are two in each meter	sd	5
So there are two in each meter	No   So 33  is 13	sd	5
No   So 33  is 13	So I m going to put a pen  there	sd	5
So I m going to put a pen  there	And 66  is 23	sd	5
And 66  is 23	And then 96	sd	5
I want you to imagine what you know already  and try to draw a piT2ure and sketch it	No we can t	sd	1
No we can t	All we know is that this is one third	sd	4
If you want to use that thick of a inaudible here	Guys we need three 13 s	sd	4
Guys we need three 13 s	We only took two 13 s	sd	4
We only took two 13 s	We  need three	sd	4
We  need three	Guys what we need is we need three thirds because  we don t need two halves	sd	5
This shows me that Meredith knows that there are  3 13 s in a meter instead of 2 13 s in a meter	No we need two thirds	sd	2
No we need two thirds	inaudible two thirds but we have to divide it to three  thirds	sd	2
inaudible two thirds but we have to divide it to three  thirds	That and that	sd	1
That and that	And we only have that much left	sd	4
And we only have that much left	So try it now	sd	1
So try it now	I don t think so	sd	4
I don t think so	It can t be there	sd	4
It can t be there	It has to be farther up	sd	4
It has to be farther up	I know where	sd	1
I know where	I can  estimate	sd	1
I can  estimate	If we put it here no	sd	1
Do you want to explain this again in front of the camera	What I did was  I made 12 meters	sd	5
What I did was  I made 12 meters	The long line is the  divider for each meter	sd	5
The long line is the  divider for each meter	In the meters there are three  thirds	sd	5
In the meters there are three  thirds	The bracket shows these two thirds and there  are two thirds and so on	sd	5
The bracket shows these two thirds and there  are two thirds and so on	So when you go down the  final answer is 18	sd	5
So when you go down the  final answer is 18	And that s the number of bows you  can make with 23 meter bows	sd	5
Ok Kimberly and Alan tell us what you did	This entire thing is twelve  meters	sd	4
This entire thing is twelve  meters	The long line is the divider of each meter   The brackets are dividing the thirds up so  there are two thirds there are two thirds there are two  thirds there are two thirds and if you count up how  many two thirds there are youll eventually get down  to eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  of two thirds out of twelve meters	sd	5
Questions	Well me and James did uh the same  thing that did the twelve and we got eighteen too	sd	2
Any other questions  comments	How are we going to be able to write what  they did	sd	1
How are we going to be able to write what  they did	I mean if we write that cause were going to  have to diagram it theres no way were going to be  able to write it	sd	1
I mean if we write that cause were going to  have to diagram it theres no way were going to be  able to write it	Should I explain it again	sd	1
Should I explain it again	No I know what you mean but wed have to  diagram it to write it we couldnt write it in words wed  have to diagram it	sd	1
Ok so one more time  please	Ok this this is all twelve meters the line this  line is what divides each meter up in each meter  there are three thirds	sd	5
Ok this this is all twelve meters the line this  line is what divides each meter up in each meter  there are three thirds	The bracket has two thirds  under it which means those are the two thirds to  make your bow and if here are two thirds here are two  thirds here are two thirds here are two thirds and  you keep going on to the end until you get up to  eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  out of two thirds each meter um of twelve meters of  ribbon	sd	5
Question	I agree with that because in my book we had  the  book for two thirds uh I did the same  thing like that and thats how I got my answer	sd	5
Ok go very slowly Kimberly	This one here all together is twelve  meters	sd	5
This one here all together is twelve  meters	And these here the long lines separate  between em	sd	5
And these here the long lines separate  between em	And there are three meters in each  meter and the brackets separate two meters and two  thirds in each meter	sd	5
I dont think you meant to say that	I know I didnt	sd	1
What did you mean then	I meant three thirds	sd	4
Three thirds of a meter in each meter	And then the brackets separate two  thirds in each meter	sd	4
What do you think Laura	Twelve	sd	4
What do you think	um Eleven	sd	4
Andrew thinks eleven	Wait no ten	sd	4
Andrew thinks ten	Thirteen	sd	4
James	I think eleven	sd	4
James thinks eleven	Well I think I think ten	sv	4
You think ten Erik	I think eleven	sd	4
Would you have to cut  the last one or is it cut for you already	No	b	1
Is the last cut is the last piece of ribbon or is it  cut for you already	There is one more	sd	4
There is one more	Alan made a mistake	sd	2
Ok but if youre cutting this ribbon how many  cuts do you make	Eleven	sd	4
You make eleven cuts and how many pieces  do you get when you cut it	Twelve	sd	4
After they  marked off these one meter lengths what did they do  next	They put the two thirds in	sd	4
Well before they put the two thirds in what  did they do before they put the two thirds in Meredith	Brackets	sd	4
Before they marked two thirds what did they mark  first Andrew	Well the um the thirds	sd	4
Meredith	Well so they could know where to put  the brackets	sd	2
Did the  brackets show one third	No	b	1
Graham	Two thirds	sd	2
Andrew	They numbered them	sd	2
Why did you start numbering them Kimberly	So that we can find out the answer  because we lost count a few times before we put the  numbers	sd	5
Oh yeah you lost count I remember one time  you said seventeen and sixteen and	Yeah	b	1
And what  did how many numbers did they end up having when  they counted two of the thirds	Eighteen	sd	4
How many of you think that  you can write up or try to write what they did	I think I can diagram it I dont think I can write  about it	sd	1
I think I can diagram it I dont think I can write  about it	We did basically what they did	sd	2
If there are one third meter lengths how  many	Seven	sd	4
Twelve meters of ribbon one third meter each	Oh	b	1
Oh	Twentyfour	sd	4
No one third	Oh thirtysix	sd	4
Andrew	Um I said I um multiplied either um  one third two third six or two to twelve and I got the  answer	sd	4
Thank you	You could divide that you could divide from zero to one it s the smallest of fractions	sd	4
You could divide that you could divide from zero to one it s the smallest of fractions	It s easy to imagine you could divide it into zillionths	sd	4
Do you want to say that one more time Alan	You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	sd	4
You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	You could divide it to zillionths depending on what number inaudible	sd	2
But if you made a number line to show zillionths you d have to have the longest number line in the world	That doesn t make sense even if you the only way you can divide it in zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	sd	5
That doesn t make sense even if you the only way you can divide it in zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	If your one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	sd	5
If your one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	Well from zero to one you could	sd	2
Well from zero to one you could	If one were tenths how could you divide it into zillionths	sd	3
If one were tenths how could you divide it into zillionths	Like I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust particle and you could put that on there a zillionth times	sd	4
Like I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust particle and you could put that on there a zillionth times	If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	sd	2
If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	I know something that is smaller than a dust particle a dust bug	sd	2
I know something that is smaller than a dust particle a dust bug	100 dust bugs could fit in a dust particle	sd	2
Andrew	Well if you made a number line and you if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put your number line under it	sd	5
Well if you made a number line and you if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put your number line under it	You would see that you have a lot more room left to put the 100th 1000th and the 100000000th	sd	5
You would see that you have a lot more room left to put the 100th 1000th and the 100000000th	What I don t understand is if you re using a microscope to give more space in actual reality you re not getting more space	sd	2
Yeah that s an interesting idea Eric	You see when you re using a microscope it looks like you re getting more space but in actual reality you re not getting anymore	sd	4
You see when you re using a microscope it looks like you re getting more space but in actual reality you re not getting anymore	It just looks like you are	sd	4
It just looks like you are	Actually you are because the human eye cant	sd	5
Actually you are because the human eye cant	Right when you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and the zero	sd	2
Right when you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and the zero	Yeah Alan but what you were saying before you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more space on that number line	sd	2
Yeah Alan but what you were saying before you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more space on that number line	No that s not what I m saying	sd	2
No that s not what I m saying	You were saying that before	sd	2
You were saying that before	Well I think that that you can t really see it too well but if you use a microscope then you re seeing it closer it looks like you re seeing more	sv	5
Well I think that that you can t really see it too well but if you use a microscope then you re seeing it closer it looks like you re seeing more	But you re really not you re just looking closer	sd	5
Okay we re going to give number names for all of those little lines wouldn t that be fun	Laugh	sd	1
Laugh	like this could be the size of the bar then there can be your line now if you had the hundreds which would probably go somewhere in here it would look say if it was right here	sd	5
like this could be the size of the bar then there can be your line now if you had the hundreds which would probably go somewhere in here it would look say if it was right here	And then you would have all that space in there It looks like it but you really don t have that much space	sd	5
And then you would have all that space in there It looks like it but you really don t have that much space	That s just if you had it really big that s how much space it would look like you see	sd	5
That s just if you had it really big that s how much space it would look like you see	So that means you could divide this into halves and thirds and fourths and fifths and all of that	sd	5
That s interesting	Yeah cause it looks like you have a lot of space but you really only have that tinsy winsy little space between there	sd	5
Yeah cause it looks like you have a lot of space but you really only have that tinsy winsy little space between there	I mean you could take a really small pen and you could divide this up into all of these pieces	sd	5
I mean you could take a really small pen and you could divide this up into all of these pieces	If you look at that with your regular eye you couldn t see that so you d have to make it bigger	sv	5
Two white rods	Two of the white rods	sd	1
Two of the white rods	Thats a red rod	sd	4
What are you  going to call the two white rods	One fifth	sd	4
I hear a  couple of answers here and Im confused so I  want to hear this	Alright the reason why we called it one fifth  is we put the red one up to two whites and  you said  what would you call the two  whites  and the two whites equal up to the  red so so if you put the reds and line them up  to the orange it makes one fifth	sd	5
Audra go ahead	Well if you put two whites against the red  rod and you put two whites up against the  red rod five times across it youd get the  same amount of whites as would reds so and  you got five reds before so you get five pairs  of whites	sd	5
Yeah because I think you have the idea I  think Im just not understanding it	If you put all the whites you could up against  it and you and you double  them up  If you put two whites together to  make one block it would be a red block	sd	5
If you put all the whites you could up against  it and you and you double  them up  If you put two whites together to  make one block it would be a red block	And  if you did that as many times as you could  youd get five times	sd	5
Meredith you have your hand up	I think its two tenths	sv	4
Beth do you want to come up	Well take the red away and you put this up to the orange	sd	5
Well take the red away and you put this up to the orange	When we did it  before we said that we said that orange has  ten whites it measures up to ten whites	sd	5
When we did it  before we said that we said that orange has  ten whites it measures up to ten whites	And  if you put the whites up it would have ten	sd	5
And  if you put the whites up it would have ten	And two of ten is two tenths	sd	5
And two of ten is two tenths	Ok Well now what do you think	sd	3
Ok Well now what do you think	Do you  want to add to that	sd	1
Do you  want to add to that	Is that basically what you  were arguing or do you want to add to that  some more	sd	3
David how  about you	Um well I think the same as Meredith	sd	2
Brian	Well even that even that two white cubes  equal up to one red cube its still not its still  not like um like um imagining that this was  another red cube so I think it really is two  tenths because it really really is two tenths	sd	5
Because you can see two there is that what  youre saying	Yeah yeah it it also is one it also is one fifth  but what you are seeing right here really is  two tenths not a fifth	sd	4
Brian is saying he can  see how it could be one fifth if we changed it  to a red if we took the two whites and  changed it to red but when he looks at the  two whites he thinks of two tenths right	Because theres two theres only two theres  only two theres not like theyre not joined  together	sd	5
Because theres two theres only two theres  only two theres not like theyre not joined  together	If you want to join them together  you should use the red	sd	5
Okay I think for  now I think   were going to leave this  controversy and come back to it later on	Stand	sd	1

Then around where would it be good	Huh	b	1
Approximately	That line well	sd	1
Well try doing it	Huh	b	1
Estimate	Uhm	sd	1
Yes	Uhm	sd	1
Uhm	Take it between th this line and this line	sd	4
Is it the same	Its appro approximate	sd	4
Wouldnt they fight over it if it was approximate	Huh	b	1
Huh	Around	aa	4

The middle of it	Yes	b	1
A method that uses the same method as last time	I cant solve it	sd	1
First of all draw a figure and	Draw the figure and	sd	1
Okay begin	You cant bring it with you	sd	1
Cant you make a triangle somewhere	Huh	b	1
Huh	Its wrong	sd	4
Its wrong	I dont understand	sd	3
Make a triangle somewhere	Huh	b	1
Draw a line somewhere and make a triangle	Oh	b	1
Oh	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Oh	b	1
Oh	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Take a parallel line	sd	4
Take a parallel line	If we  then the area of the triangle	sd	2
If we  then the area of the triangle	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Theyre not parallel lines	sd	2
Now	Oh	b	1
Oh	I got it	sd	1
Draw it	Its wrong	sd	1
Its wrong	A B	sd	1
Hum	Its different from mine	sd	2
If these are parallel then you can say something like this	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right	aa	1
Yes	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right huh	aa	1
Thats right huh	I got it	sd	1
I got it	I got it	sd	1

Yes	This okay	aa	1
This okay	Went to here and here okay	sd	4
Went to here and here okay	I got it somewhat	sd	1
Did you get it	How do you do	qy	3
You make a triangle somewhere	Well here draw one like this	sd	4
Well here draw one like this	This	sd	2
Okay	Yes	b	1
If you do that you get a triangle right	Yes	b	1
Then where would you draw a parallel line	A parallel is you understand	sd	2
A parallel is you understand	Its sideways like this	sd	2
Its sideways like this	Oh	b	1
Oh	Like this	sd	2
Over there isnt	You dont get a triangle	sd	4
Hm well where is it the same area with this triangle	Yes	b	1
Yes	Which is it	sd	3
Hm	Its three	sd	4
The area that is the same with this triangle becomes like this and it also becomes like this okay	Oh	b	1
Oh	This then this is straight up like this	sd	4
This then this is straight up like this	Here also	sd	2
Thats right huh	Oh	b	1
Oh	From here to here	sd	4
Its good if you do it like that	Oh	b	1
If you do that	Oh	b	1
Oh	Well let me try	sd	1
Well let me try	Its here and here right	sd	4
And is it just here and here	The more opposite side too	sd	4
Okay	What	ba	1
What	Dont erase it	sd	1
What are you doing putti marks	Is it	sd	1
Did you get it	Would you point to me later okay	sv	1
Would you point to me later okay	You talk too much you stupid	sd	1
Then where would you get a triangle that is the same area as this triangle	Those two	sd	4
Those two	Ha	b	1
Ha	The two	sd	4
You can make multiple numbers of it right	Th Thats what you mean	sd	1
Th Thats what you mean	Oh	b	1
Oh	I have no clue what he is saying	sd	3
Then to make this nicely into one line somewhere where should we move this	Ah	b	1
Ah	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Ah	b	1
What should we do	Like this like this	sd	4
Like this like this	Like this	sd	4
Okay	Huh	b	1
Thats thats right	Goto isnt good	ba	1
Goto isnt good	I got it	sd	1
You also need the side over there right	Ah	b	1
Thats right huh	Teacher Teacher Teacher	sd	1
What is it	I dont really understand it but	sd	3
Like this	This and this and this	sd	4
Then for this to neatly become straight where does the triangle form	Neatly	b	1
This becomes a straight line we want to make it straight	Oh	b	1
Oh	From here to here	sd	4
Or	From here to here	sd	4
Thats thats right	Teacher	b	1
Yes	Uhm this and this are	sd	1
Hm	even if we move this	sd	1
Hm	they are parallel bu Since the area is the same so	sd	4
Hm	arent here the obliq oblique lines here and	sd	4
Hm	this white part	sd	4
Hm	the same	sd	4
Youre sharp	Hm	b	1
Hamada	Here	sd	1
Here	Here	sd	1
Try explaining it	Since this and this are parallel so	sd	4
Hm	if you connect them like this	sd	4
Yes	they become equal	sd	4
Oh okay	Im going to the teachers one	sd	1
Uhm	Yes	b	1
Would you do the one you were showing just now up at the front	The one just now	sd	1
Yes	Am I supposed to explain it	sd	1
An explanation	Huh	b	1
Please go ahead	What is it	sd	1
What is it	Huh	b	1
Huh	You got to be kidding me	sd	1
You got to be kidding me	If you draw the parallel lines and why it becomes like this why	sd	4
Well you see	Yes	b	1
You look at it like this	For now please explain it one more time	sd	3
If you do that this will become the same like last time	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right huh	aa	1
Do you get it	Yes	b	1
And if you look at it like this and if its a triangle with parallel lines drawn then	Yes	b	1
Which one is the same area as this triangle	With which one	sd	3
With which one	Tri	sd	1
You wont get any numbers right	Yes	b	1
And for example in what kind what situations does this become a straight line	A straight line	sd	1
We want to make the border line a straight line	A straight line	sd	1
A straight line	Should I do it like this	sd	1
Hm	I dont understand what you are saying	sd	3
The triangle is the one that moves okay	The triangle	sd	1
Then when it goes to here does it become a straight line	Oh	b	1
Oh	What do you mean by a straight line	sd	3
What do you mean by a straight line	Oh	b	1
Its at the end of the  right	I got it	sd	1
I got it	So	b	1
So	I got it	sd	1
I got it	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Already	sd	1
Already	Already	sd	1
Already	I got it	sd	1
Its okay with this	Is it correct with that with that	sd	1
Is it correct with that with that	But you cant	sd	1
This triangle	Then doesnt it become the same as this figure	sd	4
Its not involved right	Its the same	sd	4
Right now only here is involved right	Oh	b	1
Oh	This is a straight line oh	sd	4
This is a straight line oh	Thats right	aa	1
Thats right	Thats right	aa	1
Did you get it	So	b	1
Jimbo hurry up	Anything	sd	1
Please go ahead	Now I cant explain it since Im not Japanese	sd	1
Well cheer for you	Since Im not Japanese	sd	1
Fifteen minutes	Im not Japanese	sd	1
Im not Japanese	What are you saying	sd	1
Then Ikeda will you do it	Huh	b	1

Is that from right to left	From the top	sd	1
Hurry	Please have Jimbo go first	sd	1
Yes	Is it not okay with from the top	sd	1
Of course it can be said right	It is okay from the top	sd	1
Youre sharp	Its okay even if its particularly from the top	sd	1
Its okay even if its particularly from the top	Oh well	ba	1

Its the same as  right	Pick me	sd	1
Pick me	Pick me	sd	1
Chiba	I dont understand that	sd	3
Next next	That	aa	1
Huh	Do the ones that are wrong because	sd	1
Do the ones that are wrong	I dont mean that	sd	1
Huh	Just the left	sd	1
Do it as fast as you can	Fas	sd	1
Yes	And make the triangle and parallel	sd	4
And make the triangle and parallel	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Peace to that	sd	1
Peace to that	I wont do it	sd	1
Is this just this side	Its also over here	sd	4
Oh	I cant do it even with this	sd	1
The area over here and over here	Over here	sd	1
Seems somewhat	Ill give up A B	sd	4
Ill give up A B	Yes	b	2
I think its okay okay but	Oh	b	1
When we cut it like this and did it	Now	sd	1
Now	Its okay	sd	4
Its okay	The base is the same	sd	2
Are the areas of the triangles the same	Over here and over here are the same	sd	4
Over here and over here are the same	Over here and over here are also the same	sd	2
Over here and over here are also the same	I think its better if we dont let himher do it	sd	1
I think its better if we dont let himher do it	What	ba	1
What	The end and the end are the same and	sd	2
Its okay if this and this are the same right	Its not the same	sd	4
Okay	Im saying you cant draw it	sd	4
Good	Stop it	sd	1
Stop it	Stop it okay	sd	1
Stop it okay	Stop it okay	sd	1
Please return to your seats	Teacher hes drawing extra things	sd	1
Dont write it	This	sd	1
Okay	Since they are equal so	sd	4
Good luck	Am I doing it	sd	1
Good luck	I dont understand it very well	sd	3
I dont understand it very well	Teacher please listen to me	sd	1
Okay	Hes not listening	sd	1
Go ahead	Is Chiba going to do it	sd	1
Is Chiba going to do it	Its not me right	sd	1
Please do it	This is okay	sd	1
This is okay	Hm	b	1
Hm	First of all we make a triangle okay	sd	4
First of all we make a triangle okay	What are you saying	sd	1
What are you saying	You talk too much	sd	1
You talk too much	You make a triangle right	sd	2
You make a triangle right	And then here	sd	2
And then here	His face is completely in the camera	sd	1
His face is completely in the camera	s	sd	1
s	Draw a line para para parallel over here also and we make over here as the base	sd	2
Draw a line para para parallel over here also and we make over here as the base	As the base	sd	1
As the base	Here	sd	1
Here	Yes	b	2
Yes	And then we make it the height and this triangle and	sd	4
And then we make it the height and this triangle and	Thats the height	sd	2
Thats the height	Okay	b	1
Okay	Which is it	sd	3
Which is it	I think its not that	sv	2
I think its not that	This triangle and a tri somewhere	sd	2
The red triangle	Oh	b	1
Oh	Its this right	aa	4
Yes	The red triangle is	sd	1
The red triangle is	The area is	sd	1
Over here	What is it	sd	1
What is it	Ya	b	1
Ya	Well they are the same okay	sd	4
The tri over here	Actually and the triangle over here	sd	1
Yes	The fact is that the areas are the same okay	sd	4
Hm	Since the base and the height are the same so	sd	5
Since the base and the height are the same so	So first of all the fact is we can draw a line here	sd	5
So first of all the fact is we can draw a line here	Yes yes	b	1
Yes yes	Well I dont know what I am saying but	sd	3
We can understand enough right	Oh	b	1
Oh	You understand	ba	1
You dont understand	I also dont understand	sd	3
People who didnt understand it please listen to it closely okay	First of all	sd	1
First of all	After this	sd	1
After this	The place that has a weird place like this	sd	4
The place that has a weird place like this	I got it	sd	1
I got it	In the place that is below this like this draw a line and uhm we make it into a triangle okay	sd	5
In the place that is below this like this draw a line and uhm we make it into a triangle okay	Ha then this	sd	1
Ha then this	This	sd	1
This	Something that has this side as a base	sd	5
Something that has this side as a base	That has it as a base	sd	5
That has it as a base	Draw a line that is parallel to this base by fitting it with this apex	sd	5
Draw a line that is parallel to this base by fitting it with this apex	And then the parallel line hm	sd	5
And then the parallel line hm	Since the length of base doesnt change so and in between the parallel lines always	sd	5
The height is e	The height doesnt change so like this	sd	4
The height doesnt change so like this	Up to wherever you draw it anywhere you draw it	sd	4
Yes	the area doesnt change with this this triangle that we got first	sd	5
the area doesnt change with this this triangle that we got first	So uhm its just that even if we draw up to this best places end	sd	5
So uhm its just that even if we draw up to this best places end	for this triangle and this yellow this triangle the areas dont change	sd	5
Okay begin	We cant open our textbooks	sd	1
Right	This	sd	1
This	Teacher can we open our textbooks yet	sd	1
You cant do it with it just as it is right	I dont change this	sd	4
If it becomes wha what sided shape can you do the problem	Triangle	sd	4
If its just as it is its a quadrilateral right	So were to make a quadrilateral into a triangle	sd	4
If everybody had a triangle and parallel lines then they can do it huh	Huh	b	1
Thats right	Teacher the one we call the triangle isnt just one	sd	4
Huh	One	aa	4
It may be that you can get many types huh	Is it okay with two	sd	4
Youre sharp	Huh	b	1
How can we do it	Triangle	sd	4
Since you cant do it just as it is so	What are you saying	sd	1
When you look at it like this then there is a triangle and how can we change it may I ask	Huh	b	1
Its also fine for people who dont understand to ask me	Oh	b	1
Oh	But I dont think its limited to one	sd	4
But I dont think its limited to one	There is one more	sd	2
Yes	This is okay	sd	1
Yes	How many	sd	1
How many	How many do I make	sd	1
I wonder how many can you make	Is it okay with one	sd	1
Its okay if first of all you get one but	With one zero	sd	4
Theres three	How many can we make	sd	3
How many can we make	This	sd	1
I wonder how many all of you can mak make	Oh I see	aa	1
Oh I see	Thats what you mean	sv	1
The answer is not just one	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right huh	aa	1
Thats right huh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right huh	aa	1
Thats right huh	Oh	b	1
Oh	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Its fine with this right	sd	1
Its fine with this right	Huh	b	1
Huh	Its wrong	sd	1
Its wrong	Huh	b	1
Huh	Now	sd	1
Now	The ones I havent got yet teacher	sd	1
The ones I havent got yet teacher	Wonderful	sd	1
Wonderful	Thats unfair	ba	1
There is no possibility	Excuse me	sd	1
Excuse me	Its okay with this right	sd	1
If you got one on this side then	I can get it over here and over here from this	sd	4
And cant you make a triangle over here that is the same as this	Well thats right huh	aa	1
You can get it on the opposite side right	Would I know all of them doing it like that	sd	4
Youll notice them If you notice them then that will be great	Am I supposed to draw all of them	sd	1
I wonder how many ways it can be made	Eight	sd	4
Youre sharp	I think its the same area as this quadrangle of the hint card and the notebook	sd	4
Youre advanced to a good place in the problem	Yes	b	1
Yes	I got it	sd	1
I got it	I got it	sd	1
I got it	I got it	sd	1
Yes	I got it	sd	1
Youve gotten up to a good place in the problem	But after th that Im having problems	sd	3
Then okay	Yes	b	1
For example if the corner here becomes straight with this here and here then this is	Parallel	b	4
Parallel	Does it have to be teacher Ebina who looks over my work	sd	1
Wai Its okay to come to me to have your work looked at	Triangle	sd	4
The fact is were making a triangle a quadrangle into a triangle you do what to one angle	Nagai	aa	1
Nagai	Its because theres a lot of people waiting in line for teacher Ebina	sd	1
Its because theres a lot of people waiting in line for teacher Ebina	Reduce	sd	4
That means that to reduce angles you take one	Parallel	b	4
And also	Its okay with this line segment	sd	4
You can also do this side right	The same thing	sd	1
Please think about it in many ways	Its not just one right	sd	4
Its not just one right	Is it okay with this	sd	1
The fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means what happens to the number of angles	I dont understand	sd	3
The number of angles goes from four to	Three	sd	4
For example if here were to become straight	Draw a parallel line and	sd	4
Are you done	I have gotten only one yet	sd	1
Ti	Where do I draw it	sd	1
Where do I draw it	Teacher I dont understand it very well but	sd	3
Hm okay	Theres eight	sd	4
Do you have your notebook	I do	sd	1
Hm	Then look at it	sd	1
You cant do it as it is a quadrilateral	Its this	sd	4
Yes	Its okay	sd	1
And also	Here	b	4
Dont you have to draw a parallel line to the triangle	Its here	sd	4
Triangle and hm	Here	b	4
Yes	Thats funny you know	sv	1
Hm	Here	sd	4
Since its parallel like this so in the parallel lines where is the qua thats equal to here	This is a little off	sd	4
It becomes more off	Hm	b	1
Hm	here and here and  to here	sd	4
Isnt there one more parallel line a triangle	Huh	b	1
The triangle is over here right	Then also over here	sd	4
If you cut it like this then here with this one diagonal line would you get a triangle just over here	I can do this	sd	1
I can do this	And it comes over here and	sd	4
Yes	Over here is also	sd	4
You noticed things like this on this side right	Uh huh	b	1
Isnt there anything like this over here okay	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh oh oh	b	1
On this side	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Thats right huh	aa	4
If there is a right side then there is a left side also right	How about this	sd	3
And the fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means that we do what to one angle	Get rid of it	sd	4
If there is one on this side then how about this side	Yes	b	1
Yes	Oh	b	1
Where is it	Here if there is one then	sd	4
Yes	Its somewhere here huh	sd	4
Thats right  keeps on bending and the angle disappears	Here	b	4
If it becomes like this then this angle	It disappears	sd	4
It disappears right	Yes	b	1
And if you get one on this side then this time cant you also get it on this side	Yes	b	1
Yes	Am I to draw all of these	sd	1
Am I to draw all of these	This	sd	1
This	This	sd	1
For this there are t two more more	Is it okay to change some	sd	1
Is it okay to change some	One that is a new	sd	1
If you have another one	Well its okay with it here	sd	1
Can you shrink it	Uh well	sd	1
Then cant you get one on this side	Still	sd	1
Still	Still how do I get it	sd	3
Then is this the only triangle that we can get	Oh	b	1
Oh	Will methods like these also work Oh Im sorry	sd	1
You can also do that right	Can I also do that	sd	1
Can I also do that	But this is triang	sd	1
It hasnt become a diagonal line	Its no good if its a quadrilateral	sd	2
Its no good if its a quadrilateral	It hasnt changed at all	sd	2
It hasnt changed at all	Ill also do one for you	sd	1
First of all this diagonal line like this	Triangle like these are  okay	sd	1
Please do a different one	Its like this	sd	1
The diagonal line isnt done okay	In the end this is	sd	1
In the end this is	Just now I made a little mistake	sd	4
You made a mistake	Which diagonal line	sd	3
This isnt good if its the middle point	Huh	b	1
This	Like this like this	sd	1
Huh	I dont understand this	sd	3
You drew it like this	Its not a triangle	sd	4
Oh	Thats wrong	sd	4
Thats wrong	Thats wrong	sd	2
Thats wrong	Thats wrong	sd	2
Thats wrong	Oh	b	1
Oh	Over here	sd	2
Over here	Huh	b	1
This is where its supposed to be straight okay	Thats right	aa	1
Thats right	Straight	b	4
It doesnt look straight okay	This	sd	1
This	Straight	b	4
Hey its crooked	Like this	sd	4
How many methods have you found	I dont know yet up to where I did	sd	3
If it becomes like this	Also what do I do	sd	3
How many methods did you get	Still only two	sd	4
First of all this is correct huh	No	b	1
No	Something	sd	1
Something	I thought something might be wrong	sd	1
Why did you think it might be wrong	Something	sd	1
Something	The base	sd	4
The base	The question is where to put the base right	sd	4
Youre sharp	Huh	b	1
Huh	Huh	b	1
Huh	just us	sd	1
just us	Youre so noisy	sd	1
Youre so noisy	Why dont you shut up	aa	1
Why dont you shut up	She is so scary	sd	1
She is so scary	Im not scary	sd	1
You got something like this right	Yes	b	1
One that is the same as this is this right	Yes	b	1
Thats good huh	Hm	b	1
Cant you make one on th this side	This side  a lot	sd	4
This side  a lot	Yes	b	1
Yes	I can	sd	1
With that for now it will be two methods right	It doesnt look like it	sd	4
It doesnt look like it	It doesnt look like it	sd	2
It doesnt look like it	It doesnt look like it	sd	2
Then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines	Over here	sd	4
You can draw it right	Its easy to see huh	sd	1
Are you done	Yes	b	1
How many methods did you get	Only two yet	sd	4
Which is it	One like this and	sd	4
One like this and	And this	sd	4
And this	This	sd	4
Over here huh	Hm	b	1
If the one that is the same as this triangle is this then also at this side you got it huh		sd	1
After you look for it	I found eight	sd	4
I found eight	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Eight	sd	4
Now then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines	This side	sd	4
Then cant you transform this triangle	Over here	sd	4
this original figure has become somewhat harder to understand but	This	sd	1
Is it just this side where you can get it	Over here also	sd	4
Over here also	Over here	sd	4
On this side	We can do it	sd	1
Is it just this side where we can do it	This side	sd	4
Over here	No	b	1
You found eight	Yes	b	1
Thats amazing	Eight	aa	4
How many did you get	Huh	b	1
How many did you get	Huh	b	1
Its okay if you get one	I could only get one	sd	4
How did you get one	Can I borrow this of yours Usui	sd	1
Can I borrow this of yours Usui	No way	sd	1
You got one right	Yes	b	1
Then these are parallel right	Which	sd	3
This and this	Huh	b	1
Huh	This	sd	1
This	Yes	b	1
Then the triangle and this orangecolored object is the same right	Yes	b	1
Then do you get it only on this side	No	b	1
Which side	This side also	sd	4
Already you found two	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Oh	b	1
Oh	Is it that	sd	2
Yes	Oh	b	1
Oh	With here  huh	sd	1
With here  huh	Oh	sd	1
Oh	Thats terrible of you	sv	1
This	I can see this	sd	1
I can see this	Thats terrible	sd	1
	Thats terrible	sd	1
Thats terrible	Thats terrible	sd	1
Huh	The fact about selecting our class is a mistake	sd	1
Lastly would you do it for us okay	Ill do it	sd	1
Okay	Youre still going to it	sv	1
Try looking for it	I always do it right	sd	1
One thats not there	Please tell me	sd	1
Please tell me	May I wash my hands	sd	1
May I wash my hands	How many are there left	sd	1
How many are there left	I dont get it	sd	3
I dont get it	Then this also	sd	4
Then this also	This also	sd	2
This also	There are eight right	sd	2
There are eight right	If I remember	sd	1
If I remember	There are one two three	sd	1
There are one two three	I dont understand it	sd	3
I dont understand it	Its very hard to write on it	sd	1
Its very hard to write on it	I dont understand it from here	sd	3
With this you got one	What is it	sd	3
See	Ten types	sd	4
Ten types	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Is that true	sv	1
Then if you get one on this side then	Over here	sd	4
Yes	This is	sd	1
Now then this time is drawing diagonal lines just on this side	Huh	b	1
A way to partition it	Huh	b	1
Even on this side its good if you think about it in the same way okay	This	sd	1
This	Im not sure but did both of them come off	sd	1
Im not sure but did both of them come off	The other one was still stuck here but	sd	1
The other one was still stuck here but	I was able to make a hexagon into a triangle	sd	4
You want to make a hexagon into a triangle	Yes	b	1
Then	Actually I dont want to	sd	1
Since you Phuse are asking for it lets do it okay	Youre going to make a hexagon into triangle	sd	4
Were all of them found	Yes	b	1
Do you want to do them all at once	Thank you	aa	1
I dont mind	Penta pentagon	sd	4
Penta pentagon	Pentagon	sd	2
Pentagon	Pentagon	sd	2
Pentagon	Take six	sd	2
Take six	If its a pentagon isnt it	sd	2
If its a pentagon isnt it	So what	sd	1
Who was that who said he or she found eight	Its these three	sd	4
Make a pentagon into a triangle	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	At once change to a triangle from a circle	sd	1
At once change to a triangle from a circle	Huh	b	1
Huh	Make a circle into a triangle	sd	1
Make a circle into a triangle	Huh	b	1
Also isnt there one like this	Didnt we do this	sd	1
Is it this	Thats right huh	aa	1
Normal	Lately Ive worked really hard for my life	sd	1
Also what else	The line have the lines have become messy	sd	1
Is it over with this	There should be eigh eight	sd	4
This	We havent done that yet	sd	1
One two	There are eight of them see	sd	4
There are eight of them see	There are even ten quadrangles	sd	2
What is that over there	I dont know anymore which is which	sd	3
I dont know anymore which is which	One more	sd	4
One more	The top of this one is this right	sd	2
Since its the top of this	I dont know anymore which is which	sd	3
I dont know anymore which is which	What	ba	1
What	I dont understand	sd	3
This ones	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
No	There is the bottom one see	sd	4
There is the bottom one see	Here	sd	2
I think we dont have the top one see	Its two more	sd	4
Its two more	Oh	b	1
Oh	The opposite side	sd	4
The opposite side	Oh	b	1
Thank you	Okay	b	1
Okay then everyone please return to your seats at once	Yasuda	sd	1
Yasuda	Hasnt drawn it okay	sd	1
Did it for us okay	Did you find eight	sd	4
Did you find eight	Good	ba	1
Good	Uhm	sd	1
Uhm	I dont understand	sd	3
I dont understand	Teacher there is no time left	sd	1
You dont understand	I dont understand all of them	sd	3
Well the screen is not showing up	Its showing	sd	1
And we will connect A	It came out	sd	1
Next what do you want to do	Five pentagon	sd	4
Five pentagon	Six hexagon	sd	2
Then penta	I dont have a clue	sd	3
I dont have a clue	Thats impossible	ba	4
Its impossible	Its impossible	sd	4
Its impossible	You dont know if it is impossible until you try it	sd	2
into a triangle	Right now	b	1
People who are interested you can do tenangled or twentyangled or one hundredangled or anything	We well they were talking about doing a circle	sd	4
A circle	A circle	sd	4
Its not impossible	Yes	b	1
Yes	Label it A B C D E and quadr Cut the pentagon into a quadrilateral quadrilateral and	sd	5
Yes	the quadrilateral	sd	4
Okay then we will end class	Stand	sd	1
Stand	Stop doing	sd	1
Stop doing	Reward	sd	1
Reward	Reward	sd	1
Then lets say the farewell properly	Attention	sd	1
Attention	Bow	aa	1
Bow	Thank you very much	aa	1
Well Good Morning	Good Morning	sd	1
Do you know what country the city of Oslo is in	Norway	b	1
Thats quite a long distance isnt it	Yes	b	1
Graham your hand was  up first do you want to tell our visitor what happened	Well we had a candy bar	sd	1
Well we had a candy bar	Tuesday	sd	1
Tuesday	And then We had  to make a problem and use our rods to see who got more and by  how much	sd	1
Who wants to tell us the rest of that  story	Well the people that got one fourth got more by fivethirtysixths	sd	4
Can you kind of remember it in your head without the rods  how that worked James	Umm Well we had to  thirty six whites  And it took five whites to  get from onefourth to oneninth one ninth or one ninth to one  fourth so five thirtysixths to get is the answer	sd	5
I  asked you	Umhum	b	1
Brian	Well its the same well me and Meredith kind of thought that it  was the same as nine minus four equals five	sd	5
So you were thinking whole numbers	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Meredith	Well if you put the blue which has nine ones in it and the four  plus the five rod then you have nine	sd	5
You said if you took the blue and what number name are you  giving that	Well Id call it nine	sd	4
Youre going to give it nine and what was the other rod	The four rod which I think was the purple rod	sd	4
Is that what you said	Yes and then the yellow would be the five and it would equal up to  it	sd	4
Yes and then the yellow would be the five and it would equal up to  it	That is what I thought at first	sd	1
That is what I thought at first	I think that	sv	1
Erik did you want to say  something	I think that it doesnt make sense because how could the blue rod  be one ninth of one model and the purple rod be one fourth when  the blue rod is larger than the purple rod	sd	5
I think that it doesnt make sense because how could the blue rod  be one ninth of one model and the purple rod be one fourth when  the blue rod is larger than the purple rod	Maybe If you made a  super gigantic train than maybe the blue rod would the nine but I  would think that the purple rod more sensibly the purple rod or the  yellow rod would probably be the nines and the blue rods would be  the fourths	sd	5
I heard Meredith call the blue rods	Yeah I know I just dont think the way Meredith explained the way  she thought before made a lot of sense	sd	1
Yeah I know I just dont think the way Meredith explained the way  she thought before made a lot of sense	I know I changed my answer	sd	1
I know I changed my answer	I just think the five rod equals up to the same as five thirtysixths	sd	4
So you think that the five thirtysixths is somehow related	Umhum	b	1
Is that  right	Yeah	b	1
That was very interesting so I was just wondering when  you saw the big model that was built and you saw that the person  that got one quarter of the candy bar got five thirtysixths more  than the person who got the ninth of the candy bar is that much of  a difference do you think	No I think that there is twentyfive people in the SS and that is  an odd number so so umm you cannot have all even groups that is  why I think some people got one ninth and one fourth	sd	5
Think about a way think about that  Andrew any ideas	Well what I did one day we had to do for homework that we had  to divide equally so I came up with the answer that everyone got  one and one fifth	sd	5
How did you do that	Well there were three candy bars and each one had ten rectangles  in it	sd	5
Well there were three candy bars and each one had ten rectangles  in it	So I took twenty five of them and circled it and put one	sd	5
So I took twenty five of them and circled it and put one	Then  the five left if you divided them up into fives it would be five ten  fifteen twenty twenty five so each person would get one and one  fifth	sd	5
Andrew how did you show that	Yeah well I made the three candy bars	sd	4
Can you all imagine that	Then I took two candy bars and five pieces of the other one to  make twenty five	sd	5
Okay	Then those five would be just like one candy bar but it would be  smaller so you divide them into fifths five ten fifteen twenty  twentyfive	sd	5
Then those five would be just like one candy bar but it would be  smaller so you divide them into fifths five ten fifteen twenty  twentyfive	There are enough people so everyone get one and one  fifth	sd	5
Danielle	Less	sd	4
How many think its less	Because thats  a bigger number so when you have a bigger  number you get less	sd	5
What do you think	Well I agree with her	sd	2
Well I agree with her	If you have a bigger number than you need  to take like say see its  one and one fifth	sd	5
If you have a bigger number than you need  to take like say see its  one and one fifth	If it is one fifth then  there has to be five of them in one whole	sd	5
If it is one fifth then  there has to be five of them in one whole	And If there is one  fourth And If they are  quarters then you only need four of them  to go into one whole so five is a bigger number and so it needs  more to fill up one whole	sd	5
And If there is one  fourth And If they are  quarters then you only need four of them  to go into one whole so five is a bigger number and so it needs  more to fill up one whole	So its so its less	sd	5
David what do you think	Well I think  that like if you have about this big then one half  would be right in the middle then  one third that would be kind of smaller  because you have to fit three pieces in there  and then one fourth would be even smaller than onethird	sd	5
Call something one and draw it	Umm Maybe umm the orange	sd	1
Just sketch it  Sure	Umm like If this is the one here	sd	1
Can you mark one half right where you put it like put it right  underneath so we can see it	What do you mean	qy	3
Put one half where you want to  show one half	One half Then one third	sd	4
One half Then one third	Then one fourth	sd	4
Where do  you think one fifth would be Meredith	The whole would be divided into fifths	sd	4
So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter or to the left of  a quarter	Left	sd	4
Approximate is okay Erik	Approximate	sd	1
Do  you agree	No	b	2
What do you disagree with	The one third approximately needs to be a little more over because  the one fourth  has to be half of the one half	sd	5
The one third approximately needs to be a little more over because  the one fourth  has to be half of the one half	So if you put one  fourth half of that  it would be on the left  of the one third	sd	5
So if you put one  fourth half of that  it would be on the left  of the one third	I know	aa	1
I know	I didnt I didnt put the one third	sd	5
I didnt I didnt put the one third	The one third if it was  one fourth it probably be about here right	sd	5
The one third if it was  one fourth it probably be about here right	So its not its just  approximate cause I dont think	sd	5
Now do you agree with all this Andrew	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Should I call on someone to place one fifth	sd	1
Ok Im going to ask you all one onehundredth What do you  think	I disagree	sd	4
Jakki you disagree	Well if one fifth is next to the end	sd	5
Well if one fifth is next to the end	Then five plus five equals up  to ten so it would be like in the half	sd	5
James	I think it should go more towards zero	sd	4
Alan	I think that the one tenth should be moved over just a tiny bit	sd	4
Its getting hard to do this isnt it	Yeah Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into tenths  and you have a half mark	sd	5
Yeah Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into tenths  and you have a half mark	So you have to use this as a guideline  youd have five tenths on one side and five tenths on the other side	sd	5
So you have to use this as a guideline  youd have five tenths on one side and five tenths on the other side	Now up there if you took that little space between the zero and the  one fifth and you  use that five times it wouldnt reach the half  way mark	sd	5
Brian	I agree with Mark	sd	2
I agree with Mark	It is a little far back	sd	5
It is a little far back	I think the third should be  moved up then the fourth should be moved up	sd	5
I think the third should be  moved up then the fourth should be moved up	Because that why I  thought the fifth was wrong when I did it because everything was  moved back	sd	5
And Im a little hard of hearing	Valerie shares some of the 12 candies from this box	sd	1
Valerie shares some of the 12 candies from this box	She gave Cindy 1 candy for every 3 candies she eats herself	sd	1
Okay so when you and your partner are ready could you and your partner go ahead and share what you think is going on in this illustration	For every 3	sd	5
For every 3	So theres 12 candies right	sd	5
So theres 12 candies right	So whats 12 divided by 4	sd	5
So whats 12 divided by 4	3	b	4
3	So 12 divided by 4 is 3	sd	5
And you  are Ashank	For every like 3 candies that she that Valerie has Cindy would only get 1	sd	5
What do you think they were thinking	Like in one column it contains in one row it contains 4 candies	sd	4
Andrew what do you think	the person counted 3 candies for Valerie and then put a C in the next candy because Valerie gets 3 candies	sd	5
Im sorry what	Its a whole number that matches up with the denominator	sd	4
Thats a great way to put that	Whole number A fraction is a whole number split into different pieces but the whole number is all the pieces together	sd	4
Its going to be easier than you think	Well now I understand it	sd	1
I dont think I did	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	No	aa	1
I know I didnt	Theyre going to call down for a reason	sd	1
Theyre going to call down and yell at me again	Theyre going to Do your attendance	sd	1
Keanus my only friend out right	Yes I think so	sv	1
What does the strategy mean	The word strategy means official thing that you use to help you solve an equation	sv	4
Mason you want to add to that	Strategy are different ideas on how to solve something	sd	4
Strategy are different ideas on how to solve something	Could you say techniques on how to solve problems	sd	4
So in math we call those techniques what	Strategies	sd	4
Al	Algorithms	aa	4
All right so	Blackboard	sd	1
Eric number one explain what you did and what number you came up with	I came up with 90	sd	5
I came up with 90	And how I did that was I looked at the 8 and then I went to the right and it was a 7	sd	5
And how I did that was I looked at the 8 and then I went to the right and it was a 7	So I turned it	sd	5
So I turned it	It was over 5 so I need to round it up and turn it into a 90	sd	5
Michael why do you disagree with that	Because it said Round to the nearest whole not tenth	sd	5
Zach	Because we were supposed to round off of the decimal	sd	5
Because we were supposed to round off of the decimal	We were supposed to turn the decimal number into a whole number not just change the	sd	5
What is the correct response everyone		b	4
What did you do with 99 and 12 hundredths	I looked over to the decimal and  to the right	sd	4
So what was your answer	991	b	4
Notice Haleys words were I looked to the what side of the 1	Right	b	4
And Julia what did you do for the third one		b	4
How did you get that	Because it said round to the nearest tenth and I looked to the right of the tenth and it  more so we can	sd	5
Because it said round to the nearest tenth and I looked to the right of the tenth and it  more so we can	Yes	b	2
Go	Just one and two	sd	1
I want you to do the best you can	Okay	b	1
Okay so no worries	I think we didnt do this because we have	sd	1
Turn back to your	I dont think I did it right	sd	4
Go ahead buddy	I basically just divided 5 times 1 for this 15 this	sd	4
I basically just divided 5 times 1 for this 15 this	Well you can split a whole number into 5  times	sd	4
So please explain what you did	I thought because its times 15 and 15 goes into the whole five times	sd	5
I thought because its times 15 and 15 goes into the whole five times	I got three	sd	5
And do you agree with that	Yes	b	2
How did you know to divide	Because 15 isnt quite a whole number yet and dividing just seems easier in my head than multiplying it times a number	sd	5
Okay	Its because I hold my  and thats basically	sd	1
Okay the 3 times 15 does it equal 15	No but 15 times	sd	4
I put 3 instead of 15 and turn it in	You just said	sd	1
3 and 1 is		b	4
And 3 and 5 is		b	4
And what did you get for problem number one	For the first question we got 3	sd	4
Explain to me how you got 3	Well I split 5 into fifths and it was 3	sd	5
Well I split 5 into fifths and it was 3	If you took	qy	1
Did you really take 5 and split		b	4
Good job	I did that with every single one and figured out how much was onefifth of it	sd	4
So what I got was For the  I got 4	And how did you get it	sd	4
How did you make this work	How I made this work was that What I do is  forward and the I got 20 so then I knew it was the L number was 4	sd	5
Blake did his by	Division	b	4
Mason did his with	Multiplication	aa	4
And Rob tell me how you did the next one	Okay so what I did for the third one is 7 times 5 equals 35	sd	5
Okay so what I did for the third one is 7 times 5 equals 35	so I dont want to multiply the denominator  the numerator  and I got 70	sd	5
Did you not answer a Mental Math	Oh yeah I did	b	1
Lily go ahead and tell me how you did the next one	I did 5 times  equals  so I did	sd	4
What strategy did you use because strategy is our word	So my  algorithm that I used  its the rule is divide by 5 so I just divided 15 by 5 and got my answer of 3	sd	5
Eric tell me about the next one	For 20	sd	1
For 20	Okay	b	1
Okay	What I did was	sd	1
What I did was	I just did 5 divided by 20 and got 4	sd	5
Ethan tell me how you did the next one	I did 7	sd	4
I did 7	I mean 35 divided by 5 and got 7	sd	5
And Zoe tell me about the last one	I did 10 divided by 5 and	sd	4
Why did we do it that way	Because it looked easier	sd	5
Did you all learn a new strategy	Yes	b	1
I know there were three questions	It was Julia Eric and Haley	sd	1
Your whole number a fraction is no different than a fraction of a whole number	So you could just do	sd	1
The people that did not stand up when I said If your answers were the same did at least one of you have the right answer	Yes	b	1
How is that going to work because its now three steps	whatever the 5 so 5 times 3 equals 15	sd	5
whatever the 5 so 5 times 3 equals 15	Then you do the 3  line	sd	5
Logan Im going to you the next one and if you dont know please be honest	I dont know  this option	sd	3
So Julia explain the rule that you knew you could use	So the rule I used is a fraction of because they just replace the word of with a multiplication symbol	sd	5
Okay so Julia what was the next question that I asked you	How would you solve this problem	sv	4
So Julia would you please tell the class how you did 15 of 35	So first you would you would figure out 5 times what equals 15 and 5 times 3 equals 15	sd	5
So first you would you would figure out 5 times what equals 15 and 5 times 3 equals 15	So then you would take the 3 and you would multiply it by the 3 on top and that would be 9	sd	5
So then you would take the 3 and you would multiply it by the 3 on top and that would be 9	So then 9 would be the out	sd	5
So go ahead	Im saying that you could first multiply 15 divided by 5 or sorry divide 15 by 5 which is 3	sd	5
Im saying that you could first multiply 15 divided by 5 or sorry divide 15 by 5 which is 3	And then you multiply that 3 by 3 since its times 3 and then the answers 9	sd	5
Did you have another strategy	Well I dont know if it would really work	sd	3
So Im going to ask Amy to talk about her thinking so that my friend  they have two different ways to do this	So my thinking at first I dont know if this will work though it would be like 5 divided by 3 but I dont know if you can really do 5 divided by 3	sd	5
So my thinking at first I dont know if this will work though it would be like 5 divided by 3 but I dont know if you can really do 5 divided by 3	And then you would times 15 by the answer of what you got of 5 divided by 3 or 3 divided by 5	sd	5
Talk while youre doing it though	Okay so Im going to do 3 divided by wait	sd	4
Okay so Im going to do 3 divided by wait	5 divided	sd	2
5 divided	I think I said that at first	sd	2
You said 5 divided by 3	All right	aa	1
All right	So 5 divided by 3	sd	4
So 5 divided by 3	Wait did I say that	sd	1
5 divided by 3	Okay	b	1
Okay	It would be 2	sd	4
What is 3 times 2		b	4
Okay so we know we cant do 2 can we	Uhhuh	b	1
So we can only go how many times	Once and it would be remainder 2 so 1 remainder 2	sd	4
But it would be 1 and 23	Yeah	b	1
So I would like you write 1 and 23 down	I dont think what Oh	sd	1
Then you said you would do what	And then you would multiply 1 and 23 by 15	sd	4
Okay so multiply 1 and 23 by 15	Oh	b	1
Oh	No that doesnt work that way	sv	4
No that doesnt work that way	Hold on	sd	1
Why does it not work that way	Because you cant	sd	1
Whats 1 times 5		b	4
I mean 1 times 15 Im sorry		b	4
Alyssa do you have something you would like to add	We thought that would be the same as we did the first one	sd	4
Explain how you did the first one	We said that you could do the whole number divided by the denominator times the numerator for the first one	sd	4
I love the fact What words did you just use	Numerator and denominator	sd	4
And why would you have used numerator and denominator	Because its the fraction	sd	5
So does it work out the same way Zachs does	I think so yeah	aa	2
Explain your thinking doing the problem	So	b	1
So you made that	15 divided by 5 would be 3	sd	5
15 divided by 5 would be 3	And 3 times 3 is 9	sd	5
So if you choose a method to do this what did you think is the easiest way to do it	I thought the easiest way to do it was	sd	1
Okay	On the very first one I got a bunch of All of them are wrong	sd	4
Okay	They make more sense in my head because I just	sd	1
They make more sense in my head because I just	So a fifth of 15 is 3 and then I did 3 times 15 and a fifth times 15 but I dont understand why it wouldnt work because I got 45	sd	5
So a fifth of 15 is 3 and then I did 3 times 15 and a fifth times 15 but I dont understand why it wouldnt work because I got 45	I changed it but	sd	1
So because can I really have 45 pieces in 15	No	b	1
You did	A fifth of 15 is 3 times 15 is	sd	4
Youre in should be bigger than your out	Okay	b	1
Okay	I did 15 times 5 is 75 and then 75 is a factor of 15 because 15 times 5 is 75	sd	5
I did 15 times 5 is 75 and then 75 is a factor of 15 because 15 times 5 is 75	So then I changed it back to 15	sd	5
So do you understand why it was not the right way to do it	Yeah	b	1
I didnt have the answer right off the bat did I	Uhuh	b	1
One two and three	Together	sd	1
You may not lay on the floor to do this because we dont lay down at school	Can you sit	sv	1
So what would it be	Times 20 divided by	sd	4
So write 26 times 26		b	4
Okay	And also on problem three 8 doesnt go into 20	sd	4
How did I get that 9	numerator	sd	4
If my in is 12	2 is 12	sd	4
Does it make sense	Yeah	b	1
Times 2 and divided by		b	4
So do I have to come up with some kind of common denominator	Yes	b	1
Yes	Minus 2	sd	4
What is 13 divided by 3		b	4
	Nothing goes into 13 except 1	sd	4
Nothing goes into 13 except 1	13 is stupid	sd	1
He actually divided 13 divided by 3	Not even 13 goes into 13	sd	4
So 4 and a third and then	So that would be 8 and	sd	4
Tell me	Because you have 2 and then	sd	5
Zach Bomp ba da bomp bomp	Bomp bomp	sd	1
Let me guess your hand are in the air because you turned the page and didnt know how to do number one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Number one and number 17	sd	3
Number one and number 17	Number one and number three	sd	3
You may get your	Okay	b	1
my	She said to start here	sd	1
Okay thats better	Number one and number three are impossible	sd	3
Youre all going to need to stand	Everybody	sd	1
So my problem here is 13 is it 2	23	b	4
23	Times 23	sd	4
Tell me what answer you got	We got 9	sd	4
Okay give me your answer	We said 8 at first	sd	4
Okay	8 and 23	sd	4
8 and 23	8 and 23	sd	2
I would like you guys to give me your strategy that you used to do this	We tried to find the closest to 13 because we knew that nothing times 3 equals 13 so we did 4 and 3 equals 12	sd	5
Okay	And then we did 4 times 2 is 8	sd	5
And then we did 4 times 2 is 8	And then there was 23 left	sd	5
And then there was 23 left	So you subtract the 8 from the 12	sd	5
So what she did is 3 times what is going to get me closest to 14 or 13		b	4
Haley what did you originally say we had to do	We had to divide 3 times 13	sd	4
Did I have to divide 3 times 13 or divide 13		b	4
Well Haley immediately came up with what	4 remainder 1	sd	4
Go ahead	So we already know that theres 4 remainder 1 and then since its 13 times 23 its not 13 we have to multiply	sd	5
Did I come out with 4 remainder 1	Yeah	b	1
What did I come out with	4 remainder 13	sd	4
Then what did you do	Then since its 23 we have to multiply 4 and 13 times 2 which is 8 and 23	sd	5
Does that make more sense	I want to warn you	sd	1
Tell us what it is	I did 13 over 1 times 23	sd	4
Okay	And then	sd	1
Equals 263	I have 26 lines	sd	4
26 lines	And then I put as many as I could in threes	sd	4
So theres one theres two theres three and four and five and six and seven and eight	And then theres two left	sd	4
Whichever way is easiest to do this does it come out to be the same every single time	Yes	b	1
So you got the right answer but I dont know how	Its a fourth times  because	sd	5
Its a fourth times  because	4 times 4 is 16	sd	5
Youre still missing the fraction	Yeah I had to go back	sd	4
Thank you darling	10 feet of ribbon  on a large	sd	4
But is that really the right answer	Oh wait	sd	1
Im going to let them finish this because I interrupted his thought	In the classroom theres four steps	sd	4
The same thing	2 divided by 3 is 23	sd	5
Thats what it wants you to do	Im confused already	sd	3
Im confused already	division strategy for this one	sd	4
How many times does 8 go into 20	On a large	sd	1
Twice	How much ribbon does she use	sd	3
So I have 2 and 48 and what do I need to times	Carrie	sd	1
Was she	She used 45 of it and to tie a bow on a large gift how much ribbon does she use	sd	1
I know that 5 times 2 is 10 right	In a classroom theres 14 cubbies	sd	1
In a classroom theres 14 cubbies	Along the wall each cubbie holds six	sd	1
Along the wall each cubbie holds six	How long is the line of cubbies	sd	1
Did you guys get that	We said 12	sd	4
I would like you to do the back with your partner	Miss	sd	1
Yeah	We finished	sd	1
We finished	Are we only supposed to go to three	sd	1
Are we only supposed to go to three	23 so I dont know	sd	3
23 so I dont know	Well we know that the answer is the same because its the same problem	sd	5
What is my in number friends	The in number is 13	sd	4
Oh	Oh	b	1
I love it when your little brains go the lights	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Howd you get 26	sd	3
I know what youre doing	You missed an L	sd	1
Lets go with multiplication instead of multiplication although I do like learning about dogs	Me too	sd	1
Ezra what do multiplication facts mean	Uh factors multiples	sd	4
So when I say multiplication facts when I tell you to practice your multiplication facts what should you be practicing	Basic multiplication	sd	4
Ricky what would I ask you to do	Uh practice your times tables	sd	4
Youre absolutely right but what do you mean by that	One times five	sd	4
Carrington	multiplication time test	sd	4
Van	Single digit multiplication facts	sd	4
Cade	Adding more but just adding zero to it	sd	4
Caspien	If you multiplylike if you multiply any number by zero youll get like zero	sd	5
You dont have to write this one down	Is that even a number	sd	1
Five quintillion times	Zero	sd	4
Finely	Zero	sd	4
It doesnt matter how big this is zero times all these zeros is going to be zero but then when we get all the way out here to the quadrillions zero times three is still	Zero	sd	4
Most easiest is redundant but yes	So super duper easy	sd	1
You all know the answer because this is the one I made you write a 100 times class what is the answer		b	4
Seven times eight equals 56 everyone is in agreement with this yes	Yes	b	1
Whats seven times eight		b	4
Whats zero times eight	Zero	sd	4
Zero	Partial product	sd	4
Yes but were not gonna call it that yet	Oh	b	1
The answers just 56 isnt it	No	b	1
So Im right	No	b	1
Ezra why do you think Im not right	Well you zero left you dont times it	sd	5
Well you zero left you dont times it	You do not multiply it by eight	sd	5
You do not multiply it by eight	So you just take the zero and add it to the end of the number	sd	5
I know what youre trying to say but lets work on how youre saying it	Um seven times eight is 56	sd	4
I got that up there	Theres 70 and thats not single number	sd	4
No theres two there but then I did eight times zero is zero	So we have to put the zero next to the	sd	4
Carrington	70 is in the tenths place not the ones	sd	4
See fives in the tenth place	You are impossible	sd	1
Caspien what do you think	So what I think is since seven times eight is 56	sd	4
Yup	But the wrong you wrote the wrong answer for us 70 times eight	sd	5
But the wrong you wrote the wrong answer for us 70 times eight	So like you just leave the zero alone you take it out of the number and then you get seven times eight 56	sd	5
Which is what wrote	And then you put the zero after the six	sd	4
Am I right	No	b	1
Why not	Because  number	sd	1
Ricky what do you think	I think that seven times eight is 56	sv	5
I think that seven times eight is 56	You do not add the zero you put the zero after the six but do not add it	sd	5
You do not add the zero you put the zero after the six but do not add it	You just put it after and dont put any single	sd	5
I just put a zero on it just because you said to put a zero on it	No	b	1
What do you think	I think if we add ten times no	sd	4
I think if we add ten times no	Ten times 50 it should give us 500 then	sd	5
Anybody think number ones wrong	No	b	1
Angelina what is the difference	ten times eight  ten times eight again  in zero  seven	sd	4
My second factor		b	4
Amoura	Eight	aa	4
So if I had seven of these little cubes and I put them in piles how many piles will I have	Eight	sd	4
Eight piles with seven little cubes in each of them there would be 56 little cubes correct	Yeah	b	1
Bruno	Instead of just seven in each handful youd have 70	sd	4
So Id have how many of these	Seven	sd	4
For all seven		b	4
How many piles do I have	You have eight since the equation is 70 times eight	sd	5
Whats different	Its ten times bigger	sd	4
49 and our last group of seven is 56		b	1
Were counting up by what	10s	b	4
So here 70 times eight is not 56 its 560 but do we care about the zero	No	b	1
Without the zero what answer do we get		b	4
Francis whats seven times eight		b	4
What are the first two digits of your answer		b	4
So as I stated Clyde what are my first two numbers of my answer going to be	78	b	4
In my answer Clyde		b	4
Caspien	Um so like technically all we gotta do when we see like multi digit multiplication problems is add zeros to like after our numbers	sd	4
There we go	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	Thank you	aa	1
Carrington what do you see	In the first example the  column with 300 it counts up by 300	sd	5
Crosby	In the  box it counts up by 2000	sd	4
Finely	Its counting up by 80s	sd	5
So this first one is asking you take this number and multiply it by this number	Ohhhh	b	1
And we get the same thing we had up on the board earlier right	Yes	b	1
Analies		b	4
Finely		b	4
Caspien		b	4
And how many zeros Caspien	How many zeros theres one two three	sd	4
You may start wherever you would like to start in this problem but you just have to tell us how and what you did	I was gonna start with	sd	1
Dont talk to the board the board doesnt care	Im gonna start with 80 times five	sd	4
Talk to them	80 times five	sd	4
How come	I just picked the first problem	sd	4
First box	First box	sd	1
First box	So 80 times five	sd	5
So 80 times five	So I took eight and then five 40 and then took the zero and	sd	5
Curious cause you dont even have your paper in front of you to look	Paper fell off my desk	sd	1
So what answer did you get Mr Francis	I got 450	sd	4
All right so Mr Francis why do you think its 450 when Ezra says its only 400	I kept counting up by five	sd	4
Thatd take you forever	I only counted up 58 times thats how I got my answer	sd	4
Hold up eight digits hold up eight fingersKay now count up by fives		b	4
And add a zero to the end of that		b	4
All right Annabelle pick somebody to help you	So the box that Annabelle pointed to is the second one in the five column	sd	3
So the box that Annabelle pointed to is the second one in the five column	And the equation for that one would be five times 600	sd	4
Five times 600Okay	So I took away	sd	4
Whats wrong with I dog	First of all it doesnt have  and is it talking about do you love your dog or do you  the dog	sv	4
So its missing things	Yeah	b	1
Were good now right	No	b	1
Arabella	It makes no sense	sd	4
Help me make it make sense	I am a dog	sd	4
So I just gave you a very huge hint to what is wrong with Ms Annabelles number sentence	Ohhh	b	1
What is six times five Ms AnnabelleCount up by fives six times		b	4
Whats eight times five		b	4
Yes Florian	May I please go to restroom	sd	1
With some confidence	560	b	4
What is seven times six Crosby		b	4
Beautiful and Mr Crosby how many zeros do we have in the problem	two	sd	4
Yesterday we talked about movements multiplying decimals by powers of 10 and when we are multiplying we move the decimal to right	Right	b	1
And when we are dividing we move the decimal to the	Left	sd	4
And when we move it to the left	The number gets smaller	sd	4
All right so we dont need that one	So are we going to be doing powers of 10 for the past week	sd	1
So youre going to write one greater than one and three tenths and youre going to write one less than  one and three tenths	It doesnt matter what it is	sd	1
It doesnt matter what it is	Just any	sd	1
Ms Julia Im going to ask you to explain the strategy you used to solve this math problem message	So the strategy I used is I made a grid where the number that Im doing is in the middle and then the less and greater than	sd	5
So the strategy I used is I made a grid where the number that Im doing is in the middle and then the less and greater than	So the strategy I used is I put the greater than on one side and then the less than on the other and for the greater than I moved the point to the right and for the less than I moved the point to the left	sd	5
Did she use what we learned yesterday	Yes	b	2
Was it difficult to think about that	No	b	1
If I need something greater than move the decimal one point to the	Right	b	1
And if I need it less than I move the decimal one point to the	Left	sd	4
So much easier moving to the right or the left isnt it	Yes	b	1
Least to greatest	Do we put the answer or just the problem	sd	1
Are your lights on on that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Oh no theyre not	sd	1
That red light is blinking next to the window	It blinks when it records	sd	1
It blinks when it records	Yeah the red light means its recording	sd	1
to come  up here and Im going to ask you to share what you did and explain why you did it	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I did least here and greatest up there and I did four divided by 10 to the power of three first and then three divided by 10 to the power of four and then four divided by 10 to the power of three and then three divided by sorry times 10 to the power of four	sd	5
Explain why you did that	Well I did the  times up here because I know that when you times something  it gets greater then when you divide it gets smaller	sd	5
Well I did the  times up here because I know that when you times something  it gets greater then when you divide it gets smaller	And I know when you divide something by	sd	5
And I know when you divide something by	I think I got those two wrong	sd	4
I think I got those two wrong	When you divide something by a higher number 10 to the power of four then it means it will get smaller	sd	5
When you divide something by a higher number 10 to the power of four then it means it will get smaller	And when you divide something by 10 to the power of three it will be bigger than this because it well youre dividing it by a  greater number	sd	5
And when you divide something by 10 to the power of three it will be bigger than this because it well youre dividing it by a  greater number	And then for this one four times 10 to the power of three I know that there will be three zeroes on it so it will be 4000	sd	5
And then for this one four times 10 to the power of three I know that there will be three zeroes on it so it will be 4000	And then for this one there will be four zeroes on it so it will be 30000	sd	5
Go ahead	So I solved them first and then put them in order because I wasnt  sure about them	sd	5
So I solved them first and then put them in order because I wasnt  sure about them	I knew that the multiplication ones would be bigger because dividing makes it a smaller number and multiplying makes it bigger	sd	5
I knew that the multiplication ones would be bigger because dividing makes it a smaller number and multiplying makes it bigger	So I first solved the multiplication and I got 4000 for the four times 10 to the power of three and I got 30000 for three times 10 to the power of four	sd	5
So I first solved the multiplication and I got 4000 for the four times 10 to the power of three and I got 30000 for three times 10 to the power of four	And  then 30000 is greater than 4000 so I did 30000 first and then 4000	sd	5
And  then 30000 is greater than 4000 so I did 30000 first and then 4000	Then I did the division problems and I knew what I do for dividing is say it was like four divided by 10 to the power of three	sd	5
Then I did the division problems and I knew what I do for dividing is say it was like four divided by 10 to the power of three	I would write down the zero right there since if youre dividing with decimals or whatever it takes away one of those zeroes	sd	5
I would write down the zero right there since if youre dividing with decimals or whatever it takes away one of those zeroes	So then I  and I put a decimal there and then I put the other zeroes that I hadnt used yet there and then I put	sd	5
All  right so should you put the decimal point when Im talking about three divided by 10 to the power of four where does my decimal point start	At the beginning	sd	4
What do you mean at the beginning	Well the decimal point starts at the very the first number	sd	4
So it would have been point three	No	b	1
What would it have been	What do you mean	qy	3
Where does the decimal go when you get ready to solve these	The decimal is the first thing you write down	sd	4
Thats what youre telling me	No	b	1
What should it be	It should just be two because	sd	4
What do I need to do	Add the zero	sd	4
I want you to tell me what expression of those is going to be the largest	I think the largest one is going to be 15  times 10 to the power of two	sd	4
Why do you say that	Because its multiplication and multiplication makes the number bigger	sd	5
Do you all understand that	Yes	b	1
Did I have to solve that to look at it to figure it out	No	b	1
What way am I moving my decimal	To the right	sd	4
What  is my number		b	4
Thats 10 20 30 and Im going to do	I understand this game now	sd	1
Im moving it to	To the right	sd	4
To the right for 120	Three times	sd	4
Three times	Moving three times	sd	4
I know Im going 30	Its 10 to the power of	sd	4
Do you see how to play this	Yes	b	1
But I want to make sure were doing what were supposed to be doing and understanding it	Jonathan	b	1
Austin who do you want to play with	Matt	sd	1

Another fancy name for it is the Cartesian plane	Okay wow	b	1
Okay wow	Okay you do know	sd	1
Descartes	It is like Asian	sd	1
Up is the positives and backwards is the negatives and down also the negatives	Wow	ba	1
That was a mistake	You should be sorry	sd	1
Two two negative one two negative two negative two and two zero	It s weird	sd	1
It s not really a kite	You didn t connect the last one	sd	1
You didn t connect the last one	Yes connect the last one	sd	1
If you have two positive numbers X and Y it s going to end up in this quarter of the graph	Can we write that	sd	1
Quadrant three	Wait it is negative negative	sd	4
And then quadrant four is positives and negatives	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Is the positive X and then the negative is Y for that	sd	4
For quadrant four	Yes	b	1
The second number is always Y	Okay	b	1
Is  so far done	Will you increase the numbers in that quadrant thing or you will just go straight because its positives	sv	3
And then we re going to graph these points and see how this compares to the other one	Should we graph it	sd	1
These are four other points	It s like double the shape	sd	4
We double the X and we double the Y	Just like in Mug Wump	sd	4
The new shape	Image	sd	4
This side length was	Three	sd	4
How many of these shapes do you think will fit in the red shape	Can you show us	sd	3
I m just going to do it over here just to make it a little bit more clear	It s two	sd	4
There s a lot of space up there right	Three	sd	4
It s not going to work out perfectly	It s about two	sd	2
This one if it was perfect with that extra part it would go in there	How would two times make it go into four times	sd	3
You can have your Mug Wumps in front of you	Wait do we need this Mr G	sd	1
Anybody remember	2X 2Y	sd	4
Does Zug pretty much look like Mug Wump	Yes	b	1
One other thing I want you to notice is that is this angle the same as this angle	Yes	b	1
Is this angle appear the same as this angle	Yes	b	1
Lug what was the rule for Lug	3XY	b	4
Are these angles the same as on those two shapes	No	b	1
If you think about on a computer have you ever made a picture bigger and all of a sudden you actually drag it too far to the side and it just looks super weird	Then it looks like lug	sd	4
Then GLug	It was X3Y	sd	4
Are these angles the same	No	b	1
Roger	Is there a more than one definition because thats the one with two up there	sd	1
Is there a more than one definition because thats the one with two up there	Are there going to be more when you make more shapes on a graph is there going to be different definitions or is it just going to be similar or distorted	sd	3
This one	and minus the one thats 3 times X and Y	sd	5
and minus the one thats 3 times X and Y	Would you feel that it got the original	sd	1
Lucille asked if we subtracted these two would you get back to the original	No	b	1
I think no because this is almost a 90degree angle and if you take that away from this angle you get back to really small angles	No if you add them together  and divide it by six	sd	5
No if you add them together  and divide it by six	Why six	sd	3
Im not sure	When you say the rule you mean 2X 2Y or XY	sd	3
Rory	What if you started out with Bug and tried to smaller	sd	3
You can start with a shape and you can get smaller and it could still be the same type of shape just like on a computer when you put a picture and youre like  Oh that picture is too big  you make it smaller same deal still similar	Would that be like negative three	sd	4
The first thing is a couple years ago I made a GeoGebra app	Whats a GeoGebra	sd	3
Its linked on my website	I just played with this today	sd	1
Notice whats happening in the coordinate rules	Okay	b	1
For example if we did twice as Y and twice this all it looked like that	Its Zug	sd	4
Im going to change Z and same thing I want you to notice whats going to happen to the shape whats going to change over here	Yes	b	1
This video	Is it about what polygraphs are	sd	1
This video is a really good summary and introduction of the whole unit	Mabel the comics need to stop	sd	1
Are the angles the same	No	b	1
If you dilate a shape or you do a dilation on a shape you make it bigger or you make it smaller like Rory was saying	What is that other one say trans	sd	1
Theyre not for all the different cases just for Mug	Where did you get them	sd	1
Where did you get them	Just for Mug Wump	sd	1
Youre going to have six parts that you have graphed just like youre filling in six sets of points on there	Can we use GeoGebra	sd	1

Does that make sense to you all now that youre seeing it over and over	Yes	b	1
Okay Fletcher	Do you  like if you dont know about the 4  there is one 50 and another 50	sd	4
Is this worth 50	No	b	1
No	The top	sd	4
Oh	So if you have a 50 on the top  50 times 4 is equals 200	sd	5
Could you do 5 50s and make sure 50	Yes	b	1
Pardon me Ally	You have to  and then you put one right here	sd	4

Is it okay if I estimate space for 20 kids	Yeah	b	1
Now I have to do the exact same with this one	You have to add a zero to the place value	sd	4
Ethan	The ones place	sd	4
So everybody whats seven times six	Fortytwo	sd	4
Everyone what is seven times thirty	Twentyone	sd	4
Twentyone	No two hundred and ten	sd	2
Twenty one and twenty one plus four	Twenty five	sd	4
Yall agree with that	Yes	b	1
Everyone what is twenty times six	One hundred and twenty	sd	4
I automatically know that I can write the twenty right	But I need to carry my one	sd	4
Because if Im adding one to it what do most people do	Six hundred and one	sd	4
Is that right	No	b	2
I say what is two times six	Twelve	sd	4
And plus one	Seven	sd	4
Isnt it automatically already in the hundreds place	Yeah	b	1
Or Im sorry two plus zero	Seven	sd	4
Seven plus two	And my answer is nine hundred seventy two	sd	4
Process	Process	sd	4
What is my three really worth	Thirty	ba	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
So like I say this is where it gets tricky but you guys are rock stars and I have no doubt in my mind that you are going to be successful doing this and you will accurately solve a multiplication problem with a two digit by two digit factor	Okay	b	1
Elijah what do you think	Once we use the answer I think you just have to add a zero at the end because all the only difference is adding ten to eight and you just have to attach the zero	sd	5
Layla what do you think	I think you would have to do the ten times the fifty and then the ten times the four and add that one	sd	5
What do you think Annie	I think like what Elijah said attach the zero because its times one plus	sd	5
I think like what Elijah said attach the zero because its times one plus	I tried to keep it as	sd	5
Okay	Lets see if these processes work or if Laylas process works	sd	5
Lets see if these processes work or if Laylas process works	Okay	b	4
Everyone whats eight times four	Thirty two	aa	4
And okaywhat is eight times fifty	Four hundred	b	4
Everybody understand	Yes	b	1
And then when I started teaching math I was like what is ten times four	Ohhhhhhh	b	1
So now	And if its the hundreds place then you have a two	sd	4
And if it was the thousands place	Three	sd	4
And if it was the ten thousands place	There you go	sd	4
You always add those zeros because you make sure you are in line with the process you are doing	Okay	b	4
What is ten times five	Oh did I have anything that I needed to carry	sd	4
No	No	b	4
You did one times four	So when you put the four there	sd	1
So when you put the four there	Good job	sd	2
Good job	Okay	b	4
Okay	So now I have one times five equals what	sd	4
Five hundred	All right	aa	4
Seven	Whats five plus four	sd	4
Whats five plus four	I didnt know that that was going to be the same answer	sd	4
I had no idea	What is going on	sd	4
Dont worry about it being the same answers	Its not a big deal	sd	1
Its not a big deal	Okay so now Elijah did your add the zero work	sd	1
Good call	Okay	b	4
All right	So now	sd	1
Oh they showed us an an area model	Fifty four times eighteen which is really ten and eight	sd	1
Landon I want you to try it	Nope I want you to try US traditional	sd	4
Just as long as you understand what that bow tie method is	That is the process Im talking about	sd	4
Then whats three times five	Fifteen	sd	4
Eighteen	Okay now add those two together	sd	4
What is thirty seven times twenty	Seven hundred forty	sd	4
Whats thirty seven times five	So this is the way I do it	sd	4
Carry your three	Whats three times five	sd	4
Eighteen	Hey thats not right	sd	4
Okay	Oh	b	4
Oh	By hundred and eighty five	sd	2
You were right here	Seven plus seven	sd	1
but I like to do it like this	Yes as long as youre doing it that is fine	sd	4
Im going to use that and show that as an example too	Yes maam	sd	2
Hey show me your whiteboards	I want to see where youre at right now	sd	1
What am I going to carry over	The three	sd	4
Right okay	Now what is five times three	sd	4
And what is fifteen plus three	Eighteen	sd	4
Im going to carry my what	The one	sd	4
		b	1
And six hundred plus one hundred is		b	4
Twelve	Twelve	sd	4
What do I have to carry up there	Okay	b	4
Okay	What is it doing	sd	1
Lets see if itll do it	Okay because we Samanthad the one	sd	1
But she understood this	She said Oh	sd	1
Then she had thirty seven times five is what	One hundred eighty five	sd	4
Im going to show you something else real quickly	Let me borrow your white board	sd	4
Nine twenty five	Nine twenty five sorry	sd	4
My goal and your goal to be successful	Great job	sd	4
Mmhmmm	Okay	b	1
Five or more what do we do	Greater than four	sd	4
Okay	Because its closer to that value	sd	4
Whats eight times six	Eight times six is forty eight	sd	4
All right no eight times two Im sorry eight times Im like why are you saying forty eight and I realized why you were saying that	Is thirty one closer to thirty or forty	sd	4
Write the word number thirty times forty three closer to forty or fifty	Okay	b	4
Whats three times four	Twelve	sd	4
One thousand two hundred	There you go	sd	4
You see how Im estimating	Yes	b	4
I would like you to complete one two three explain how that estimation helped you and I would like you to complete this area model over here	Friends area model is to evaluate	sd	1
Yeah I was confused at what she said	Okay do you know what youre doing	sd	1
We are going to do this for five ten fifteen twenty minutes	Go	b	1
I only want you solving these three	I dont want you doing these	sd	1
Youre doing them	If you would like  let me back up if you know you need to understand in order to be successful on evaluation should you check a couple	sd	1
Is that four digits	No	b	1
Say it	Gets 10 times bigger	sd	4
When I move to the left it gets	10 times smaller	sd	4
My five is worth		b	4
My five is worth		b	4
What is that five worth		b	4
When we move to the right we went up by		b	4
It was worth 10 times more	Its always the same thing	sd	4
When I go to the left it becomes what	10 times lower	sd	4
10 times lower	One 10th less	sd	2
So now youre going to write a number in which 8 is worth one 10th as much	Does it have to be three digits again	sd	4
Yeah I just want the three numbers	Okay	b	1
All right my precious little angels	Miss	sd	1
Yes	I think that the  the camera	sv	1
Guess what	What	ba	1
Just one moment	But its 22	sd	1
Why is it not letting me present	I think if you hit the arrow up there in the right  it will	sd	1
This link	Yeah	b	1
This is not new	So when it has a number to the side just to clarify thats how many times you multiply it by	sd	4
What am I doing	Attaching	sd	4
We dont add because what happens when I add zero plus zero	Zero	sd	4
What happens if I have 10 and attach a zero to it		b	4
Think about that that anything times zero is	Zero	sd	4
10 to the power of one is just		b	4
10 to the power of two is		b	4
10 to the power of three is		b	4
Because its 10 times 10 equals		b	4
Times 10 equals		b	4
I had Maggie	You keep calling her Maggie	sd	1
What is it called	Exponent	sd	4
What is it called	Exponent	sd	4
Now I want you to write the number sentence underneath it	Okay	b	1
What would that look like	10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10	sd	4
Brogan whatd you get for an answer	I got one million	sd	4
Is it easier for me to write it out in standard form or in exponential notation	Exponential notation	sd	4
If I have four to the power of three what am I doing with that four	Multiplying four times four three times	sd	4
Im not adding a zero Im	Attaching a zero	sd	4
120 by 10 times 10 what am I doing	Attaching a zero	sd	4
Attaching a zero to what		b	4
120 turning it into		b	4
Which makes my number	Higher	aa	4
How much bigger	10 times	sd	4
If Im doing 1000 times 1000	Holy thats a lot	sv	1
Because anything multiplied by zero by itself is	Zero	sd	4
Thats an awful long way to do that problem isnt it	Yeah	b	1
Every attached zero ups my number by		b	4
Im making you all say this because the more you say it the more it sticks	Muscle memory	sd	4
Cole tell me what you think	What was the question again	sd	1
How does it help you	Its the pattern that helps you write it is	sd	4
Do you need to phone a friend	Yeah	b	1
I want you to listen very carefully once you phone that friend to their response	I think having the exponents helps the number knowing our pattern helps me because if it were 10 to the power of five as my  I could just know that I need to attach five zeros	sd	5
Add a zero or attach a zero sorry	when you attach one zero  attach one more	sd	4
He know becomes my what		b	4
How many zeros have I attached	Three	sd	4
What place value is Ava		b	4
What is he place value		b	4
What place value is Olivia		b	4
What place value is Rylan		b	4
How many zeros have I attached	Seven	sd	4
What place value is Izzie		b	4
How many zeros have I attached	Eight	sd	4
What place value are you Cole		b	4
So if I know the place value system am I able to determine how many zeros need to be attached on that 10	Yes	b	1
If I wanted to go up to 100000000000 Christian I want to know how to go to 100000000000 how many zeros do I attach	Three	sd	4
100000000000	Oh	b	1
How many place values is that	It would be 18	sd	4
Help him out Josh		b	4
How come 11 Josh	How come 11 is so theres nine zeros for 1000000000 so youre going to attach two zeros to get to 100000000000	sd	5
I want your exponential notation to be a 10th of 10 to the power of six	Wait what does that mean	sd	3
Wait what does that mean	What	ba	1
Or am I getting smaller	Smaller	sd	4
These should be done and ready to move on	Its	sd	1
What is one 10th of 1000000000 everybody		b	4
Does 10 to the power of seven work on that	No	b	1
Because that got a 10th bigger didnt or it got 10 times bigger	Yeah	b	1
What would the exponential notation of this be everybody	10 to the power of five	sd	4
One minute	And you want us to do times 10 and standard notation	sd	4
Thumbs up	Give me a thumbs up	sd	1
Give me a thumbs up	Thumbs up	sd	1
Thumbs up	Thumbs up	sd	1
All four	Wait and you want us to go one 10th less every time	sd	4
What number is that everybody		b	4
Now 10 to the power of without thinking or without writing I want you to think of something Joshua do you remember 10 to the power of what equaled 1000000000	Uh 11	sd	4
That was 100000000000	Oh	b	1
10 to the power of what is going to equal 10000000	10 to the power of seven	sd	4
Tell me why 10 to the power of seven	Because 10 to the power of six is 1000000	sd	5
Because 10 to the power of six is 1000000	So if you add one more 10 to it its 10000000	sd	5
Are you seeing the patterns	Yes	b	1
100s are	Three	sd	4
1000000s are	Seven	sd	4
Or what am I attaching to that three everybody	Zero	sd	4
How many	Three	sd	2
So if I know that three times 10 to the power of two is really just three times 100 I know my answer is what		b	4
What is it		b	4
1000000000 right	Yeah	b	1
Times		b	4
Zero zero zero comma	Zero zero zero comma	sd	1
How did I know how many zeros I needed to attach everybody	To the power of nine	sd	4
Everyone what is seven times 1000000000		b	4
So what should be the first number here		b	4
And what should be the second number	The power of	sd	4
Whats 10 to the power of four everybody		b	4
And what does three times 10000 equal		b	4
What number comes here first		b	4
So whats 10 to the power of three everybody		b	4
What		b	4
And what is 25 times 1000		b	4
Whats my power of here		b	4
	Because theres six zeros	sd	5
Yeah	Its 93000000	sd	4
So it would just be the 1000000 right	Yeah	b	1
What am I multiplying here everybody	93 times 10 to the power of six	sd	4
Do you need the pattern	Yes	b	1
And if you forget do we have a resource over her	Yes	b	1
So	Oh	b	1
Emily	You could	sd	1
Give me a variety of different ways I can write 6000 in expanded form	You could write the six and then underneath you could write 1000	sd	4
Whats another way I could write it Jake	Just 6000 plus	sd	4
Just 6000 plus	Because its 6000 then plus the 100	sd	4
Whats another way I could write it Harmony	You could do in parentheses six times 10 to the power of three	sd	4
Plus five times 10 to the power of	Zero	sd	4
Got it	Yeah	b	1
You already did your 21 so you do not have to redo it	Its the same thing all the way down	sd	4
What kind of angles to these make	Alternate interior	sd	4
could be anybody What kind of angles are these	corresponding	sd	4
And Patrick what kind of or what do we know about corresponding angles	That theyre parallel	sd	4
are they the same	Yeah	b	1
What kind of angles are these	Same side interior	sd	4
And are same side interior anglesThe same	No	b	1
Starts with an S	supplementary	sd	4
What do we do last to finish off this problem	Check it	sd	4
What is the other angle has to be 20 with the 103	77	b	4
Okay what are those two highlighted parts Ivan	corresponding	sd	4
So corresponding and Ivan what uh what do we know about corresponding angles	Theyre congruent	sd	4
Should we take away x or take away 3x	Take away x	sd	4
Lizzie whats up	Um so for that angle it looks like a 90 degree angle	sd	4
Um so for that angle it looks like a 90 degree angle	But is that not the case	sd	4
But is that not the case	Because like the equation that makes sense but it looks like a 90 degree angle	sd	4
Does that make sense Lizzie	Yeah thank you	aa	1
What do we know about those	Equlity	b	4
Not congruent	They equal 180	sd	4
Okay anybody have a suggestion on this one	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Ian	Well the corresponding angles For y minus 40 is the angle that would add together with y to make 180	sd	5
Well the corresponding angles For y minus 40 is the angle that would add together with y to make 180	So when that mean that y minus 40 plus y would be 180	sd	5
when they combine like this	linear pair	sd	4
I just have a question	Like another way you could solve this problem	sd	3
Yeah go ahead	If youre not the angle vertical to y Thats corresponding to x plus 20	sd	5
If youre not the angle vertical to y Thats corresponding to x plus 20	So that would be 95	sd	5
So that would be 95	Could you do 95 equals y	sd	5
Lets	Im not sure if thats right But	aa	1
So you said this angle	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Would that angle be the same as The corresponding angle 95	sd	4
I think youre muted right now	Oh yes	b	1
So like	yeah thank you	aa	1
Awesome job	Can you make a handshake for that	sd	1
For what	For showing	sd	1
For show	the board	sd	1
Chloe give me yours	70 and 65 tenths	sd	4
Comment Hunter	That wouldnt work because the five is in the hundredths place	sd	5
Who would like to give me their number	I put 70 in five tenths at the same time with	sd	4
Lily	I did 90141	sd	4
I see how you You did nine	Zero one	sd	4
zero one		b	4
Im going to clean this one	Mine works	sd	1
If youre going to	Yes you turned it off Miss	sd	1
Yes you turned it off Miss	Warren	aa	1
I turned it off	Yes because its not working	sd	1
There we go	Its raining cats	sd	1
Show me your boards	Hold on	sd	1
Im going to call on three people to come up and hold up their boards like this	Please	sd	1
Hey you are going to listen to these three friends	Im still doing mine	sd	1
Matteo can you just hold this for Levi	What I did is I put a four right here under thousands place and then for the thousandths place I put a seven back here to show that there was	sd	5
You put four in the thousands place and a seven in the what place	Seven in the thousandths place	sd	4
Awesome	What I did I put a four in the thousands place and I put a two in the hundreds and I put 697 thousandths in the 47 thousandths into thousandths	sd	5
Do we agree with Matteo	Yes	b	2
All golf claps are quiet	Im sorry	sd	1
Violet	I put four in the thousands place and then I just filled it in with different numbers ahead of it and then I put the seven in the thousands place	sd	5
do this we need to do our learning intention	Can we erase	sd	1
One two three	I can shade grids to represent and solve decimals and subtraction problems	sd	1
Matteo can you tell me what you and your partner spoke about about the picture	The picture on the bottom said because we see how 49 doesnt fill up all the five things it was in and then it adds one pen which fills up almost the full entire bar but another one has to fill in that other square	sd	5
I will know Im successful when I can accurately	Accurately shade the grids to represent the numbers to find the sums and differences	sd	1
Accurately shade the grids to represent the numbers to find the sums and differences	Explain my representation	sd	1
Wyatt	Subtraction	aa	4
Subtraction	The answer to a subtraction problem	sd	4
Arden	Add	sd	4
What does it mean to represent Asher	Im not sure but to show something or maybe	sd	4
To show something	Or maybe a way	sd	4
Or maybe a way	A different way	sd	4
Ezra	To show your work how you got it	sd	4
To show your work how you got it	For example the US flag represents the United States	sd	4
Turn knee to knee and talk	Did you get 67 hundreds	sd	2
Did you get 67 hundreds	Yes	b	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Well Ive seen new white board up is going to be shown up the front of the room	I agree	aa	2
Leah will you go to the front of the room and share your thinking	Okay	b	1
Leah youre going to say Im setting the model up okay	What I did was I looked at the bottom of the blues and saw it covered two of them	sd	5
What I did was I looked at the bottom of the blues and saw it covered two of them	Then I just made sure that all those were covered	sd	5
Then I just made sure that all those were covered	I knew that it was 20 blue squares	sd	5
I knew that it was 20 blue squares	Then I counted how many columns there were of red and I counted four	sd	5
Then I counted how many columns there were of red and I counted four	Then there was one that just had seven cubes covered	sd	5
Then there was one that just had seven cubes covered	Then I added onto them the 47	sd	5
Then I added onto them the 47	I added	sd	5
67 what	67 hundreds	sd	4
What does this grid represent Willow	It represents a 10 by 10 grid	sd	4
Youre right	Tens	sd	4
Youre right	Hundreds	sd	4
Lucy	Tens	sd	4
Violet		b	4
How would we say this	Thats whole	ba	4
Levi	67 hundreds	sd	4
Arden	33 hundredths	sd	4
33 hundredths plus	54 hundredths	sd	4
Matteo	The tenths	sd	4
What number is in the tenths place	Three	sd	4
Claire	You feel three tenths one two three	sd	4
Im I done	No	b	1
No	Because theres still 30 hundredth square so you have to cover in	sd	5
Im I done with 33 hundredths	Yes	b	1
Comment Antony	54 hundredths	sd	4
Five so what does that mean	Five tenths	sd	4
Five tenths so I need to fill in what	Five rows	sd	4
Five rows	Yes	b	1
Next Levi	Then you need to fill in the four hundredths	sd	4
That means I just fill in four of the what	Four of the squares	sd	4
Im I done	Yes	b	1
Lucy	You could add the tenths so you could add five of three which is eight and then you could add the hundredths	sd	5
Im I done	No	b	1
Levi	You got to add a decimal before the eight	sd	4
Lucy	87 hundredths	sd	4
87 hundredths agreed	Agreed	sd	2
Classidy class	Yessiyess yes	b	1
Where do I start	Number 60	b	4
Antony	Lets do five of them	sd	4
Everyone say hundredths	Hundredths	sd	1
Ezra where do I start	When you shade in two columns	sd	5
When you shade in two columns	Then you add eight zero squares	sd	5
Six plus two equals what	Eight	sd	4
We have 68 correct	Yes	b	1
Plus 25		b	4
First five plus eight		b	4
What		b	4
We will continue this in a second	Addison do you forgive me	sd	1
I dont know how I messed this up but now all my titles are gone again	Again	sd	1
I didnt do anything	Shut down your whole entire computer then turn it back on again	sd	1
Shut down your whole entire computer then turn it back on again	Thats what made it work last time	sd	1
Audrey you might need to leave and come back and see if that helps	Wait I couldnt find that one	sd	1
Yeah it was the very first one it was called Which do you like best and why	I never found it	sd	1
Yeah Charlie	So what couldve used a little bit of work was number two that it couldve been a little bit more neater so we could understand	sd	4
So what couldve used a little bit of work was number two that it couldve been a little bit more neater so we could understand	And what could work a little bit more was also number one is to not shake the paper a lot all over so it could see better	sd	4
It was blurry that one was definitely hard to see huh	Yeah	b	1
Do you see answers in number two	Yes	b	1
Do I see some work	Yes	b	1
Do I se evidence of work	Yes	b	1
Do I know where the final answer is	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Because I see an answer here and here and here and here and here and here and here	And also we dont know what the question is asking	sd	4
So Im going to ask right now you should have a pencil in your hand and you should be working on paper because in a minute youre going to show me on your camera what youve done	Hello Maam	sd	1
Hello Maam	I forgot because I was talking to my mom	sd	1
How much money will he have left after he buys the books	What was the number again	sd	3
What was the number again	You read a little bit too fast	sd	1
The number of what	Of after we write Mr	sd	1
Of after we write Mr	Swanson	sd	1
He has 350 to spend	Okay	b	1
Okay	350 to spend	sd	1
Oh can you guys not see it	No	b	1
There you go now can you see it	Yeah	b	1
Natalie if you have me pinned you wont be able to see what Im presenting	One second	sd	1
You dont have to have the problem solved but I would like to see a start of something		b	1
I need everyone to turn on their camera and show me what youve done so far	I was writing the question	sd	1
You dont have to rewrite the entire question again	I made a little box at the bottom of my paper and thats where my work is	sd	1
Natalie are you showing anything	Yeah I just did	sd	1
Emery Lucy	I already showed mine	sd	1
So they gave him a budget of 350	I cant see your board	sd	1
Charlie what do you think	What I think is I think that were going to do five times six or 10 times six	sv	4
Okay why do you think that	Because I think we could do one of those two five times six or 10 times six because each ones costs 10 but theres five How many books there is in a package theres five of those	sd	5
Because I think we could do one of those two five times six or 10 times six because each ones costs 10 but theres five How many books there is in a package theres five of those	So I think we should do one of the two 10 times six or five times six	sd	5
Okay well go Lucy and then well go Valentina	50 times six because theres five package of 10 and we count by 10s it would be 50	sd	5
So you want to do 50 times six	Yes	b	1
What do you think	I was going to do the same thing 50 times six because when you add the 10s its 50	sd	5
I was going to do the same thing 50 times six because when you add the 10s its 50	So each packet is going to have 50 in it	sd	5
So each packet is going to have 50 in it	So 50 times six	sd	5
Anybody		b	4
So how much money did he spend on books		b	4
Whats the next step	Well we know that we spent 300 which is up there so I think we will have to subtract 300 and 350	sd	4
How much money does he have left		b	4
I hope he doesnt need to make any other big purchases because	Also something that we could do is that if we know that its 300 right here it has 50 so we could just take the three off and we know that we would get 50 but we need to always get that answer that we always have	sd	4
Questions about this problem before we move on	No	b	1
Thanks Toby	Was it 137	sd	1
Natalie will you read it for me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	The second one	sd	1
The first one	Danielle and Hector are selling raffle tickets to raise money for the school band	sd	1
Danielle and Hector are selling raffle tickets to raise money for the school band	Danielle sells five tickets per day for four weeks straight then she sells four tickets per day for one week	sd	1
Danielle sells five tickets per day for four weeks straight then she sells four tickets per day for one week	How many tickets does Hector need to sell if he wants to sell more tickets than Danielle	sd	1
Does it say anything about how many ticket Hector sells	No	aa	1
Any ideas	I have one	sd	1
Okay whats your idea	So first we could do five times seven because theres seven days in a week	sd	5
Okay	Then do that times four	sd	4
Then do that times four	Then we have the answer to five tickets a day for four weeks	sd	4
So if we multiply this times seven because theres seven days in a week then we could take that answer and multiply it by four	Yeah	b	1
So what is five times seven		b	4
Valentina what do you think	I think that you should do four times seven	sv	4
Why four times seven	Because each day in a week theres seven days in a week and she sells four a day	sd	5
Yeah	Four tickets a day	sd	4
What is four times seven		b	4
		b	2
		b	2
Are we done	No	b	1
Toby do you think you know what we do	Add up the answers we got	sd	4
So whats 140 plus 28	168	b	4
So do you mind if I erase this	Yeah	b	1
She sold four tickets a day for one week	Do we write all of that	sd	1
If you have your other work this is fine Im just trying to wrap it all up in a cute little bow for us	Okay	b	1
Were going to do	Were going to do two	sd	1
Yep were going to do number two right now	All of it together	sd	1
Okay	All right got you	aa	1
Oh Gabriella you want to read it	No thanks sorry	sd	1
Perfect Toby	Aleah buys	sd	1
Aleah buys	I dont know how to say	sd	1
I dont know how to say	I actually dont	sd	1
You dont want to read it	No	b	1
Okay	Aleah buys four cartons of eggs each month	sd	1
Aleah buys four cartons of eggs each month	Each carton contains one dozen eggs	sd	1
Each carton contains one dozen eggs	How many eggs does Aleah buy in two years	sd	1
How much in a dozen Natalie		b	4
And she looked at me like I was crazy and then she stopped for a second and she goes So you bought	A dozen doughnuts	sd	1
Sammie are you still here	Yes	b	1
Winston are you still with us	Yeah	b	1
You just	Yes	b	1
Addison	Yes Maam	sd	1
Abel are you still with us	Yes	b	1
Stella	Yes Im still here	sd	1
What did you do first	What I did first is 12 times four	sd	4
Why 12 times four Lucy	Because theres	sd	1
Because theres	Wait is there eggs there	sd	1
I would do the exact same ting I just wanted to hear you explain it a little bit more	What I would do	sd	1
Let Lucy finish explaining and then well move to you	Oh okay	b	1
Okay	I said 12 times four because there are four eggs and then I did twelve times four and then it equaled 48	sd	5
Natalie what are you thinking	I thought since theres 365 days in a year I thought if I do 12 of 365 days Id maybe get the answer	sd	4
Youre	Maybe times	sd	4
Whats four times 10		b	4
Whats four times two	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Eight	sd	2
40 plus eight is		b	4
I think she really likes eggs what do you think	I like eggs also	sd	1
Are we done here	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
Now what	Add them all together	sd	4
We only have 48 eggs a month	Yeah but we didnt add four times 12 four times 10 and four times two then then add them all together	sd	5
So we got four times 10 is 40 four times two is eight we got 48	Yeah but you forgot one question	sd	4
Whats that	Four times 10	sd	4
Right here	Oh	b	1
We know how many eggs she eats in a month but we want to know how many in a year	Wait maybe 48 more	sd	4
Valentina what do you think	I think its 48	sv	4
I think its 48	You can do 48 times 12	sd	2
Why 48 times 12	Because theres 12 months in a year	sd	5
You following me	Yeah	b	1
All right	Yeah	b	1
How many eggs is she eating in a year	Do we type our answers in the gap	sd	1
Whoa	I could just double my answer	sd	4
Does anybody agree with me	Yes	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Anybody else	You joking	sd	1
You joking	I got that right too	aa	1
I got that right too	I got that right	sd	1
I got that right	If you add it all together you get that	sd	4
If you add it all together you get that	Its that exact answer	sd	4
And because we wanted two years we did 576 plus 576 and we got our final answer of 1152 eggs	I got it right	sd	1
Dont leave the Meet stay in but go ahead and take a 10 minute break	Do I need to send this to you	sd	1
thumbs up when youre done	Do we need to do all of the problems	sd	1
Gage Are you done	Can you go back to the page please	sd	1
Turn your microphone on	Okay	b	1
Tell me what are multiples of nine up to 50	s9 1827	b	4
Go ahead		b	4
Go ahead		b	4
Okay and lets go one more		b	4
I just told you what it would be	40 plus 9	sd	4
Can you help me with that one Zoe	but Im confused because that makes 49	sd	5
So Zoe using that divisor come up with an addition problem Thats gonna get me to 40	s31 plus nine	sd	4
Okay so what is our closest divisor to 40		b	4
Okay so if I did 36 what do I have to add to it to get to 40	plus 4	sd	4
I still have to come up with four more dont I	sMhmm	sd	1
Ben whats a division problem I could do to get me the for more I need to get to 40	To get more to get	sd	1
Ben	four	sd	4
Everybody		b	4
Is that making any sense to you guys	Yep	b	1
What numbers can I add together that are going to give me 40	Did we already use 30 10	sd	4
Type it in the chat box	Do we write this in our journal	sd	1
Can somebody see the chat box	He hasnt said anything	sd	1
He hasnt said anything	He hasnt said anything	sd	1
He hasnt said anything	I dont get this	sd	3
And then I am going to go back to a share real quick	is 40 divided by nine is four with the remainder four	sd	5
when youre done I want you to double check your answers	T your cameras kind of shaking	sd	1
Can you say that	yeah 120	b	4
Okay how do you know Laura	I know that because two times six equals 12	sd	5
I know that because two times six equals 12	And then theres one zero so you just add that one zero	sd	5
50 times five Royce	Im gonna get up	sd	1
Im gonna get up	Oh can I get a Can you skip me for now	sd	1
Lets go to lets go to Kurt T Kurt  t 50 times five		b	4
How do you know	We do five times five which would equal 25	sd	5
We do five times five which would equal 25	And then we add a zero	sd	5
Royce 40 times		b	4
Are you sure	I mean 320	sd	4
Ah okay Royce can you explain to me why its to 320 and not 360	Because I took off the zero and put in my answer	sd	5
Because I took off the zero and put in my answer	And then I did four times eight	sd	5
And then I did four times eight	Um so I know two times 8 is 16 in there too	sd	5
Um so I know two times 8 is 16 in there too	So I added 16 and another 16	sd	5
So I added 16 and another 16	I got I got 32 and then I put in my answer and just add the zero	sd	5
Nice so you use repeated addition to figure out four times eight	Yep	b	1
Scarlett 400 times six	Wait	sd	1
Ah		b	4
Oh 2400 How do you know that River	You take two and like you take two of it like two sixes then you do like you push them together thats 800 then you can just do like eight times three because then you only have to do it two more times	sv	5
And it even tells you the mathematical problem down at the bottom	Yeah My mom made me practice this website last summer so Id know my multiplication	sd	1
Are there questions about the multiplication chart	Nope I know how to use it now	sd	1
Any other questions	Are these supposed to be a trick question	sd	1
Are these supposed to be a trick question	Are you supposed to add them up afterwards	sd	4
Um Mari and Lucas T Mari and Lucas t What do you guys talk about	We talked about the problem	sd	4
Mari can you share the strategy that you and Lucas t were using	We started doing basic division and then we got the answer of 120	sd	4
Okay so can you explain to me what you mean by when you say um we started using basic division	But we asked each other like how many times is 0 going to nine and we both said zero	sd	5
But we asked each other like how many times is 0 going to nine and we both said zero	then we asked ourselves how many times does 4 go into nine twice	sd	5
then we asked ourselves how many times does 4 go into nine twice	And then we asked ourselves How many times is five go into 9	sd	5
And then we asked ourselves How many times is five go into 9	Once	aa	5
Once	So thats how we got the answer of 120	sd	5
So with this so Mari and Lucas T Did you guys have any equation to solve this problem	Yes we did	sd	1
What was the equation Mari	540 divided by nine	sd	4
Did anyone else find this equation	Kurt T didnt Kurt thaI was with didnt talk at all	sd	1
Why did you come up with 540 divided by 9	Because we read the problem	sd	5
Because we read the problem	We found our two big numbers	sd	5
We found our two big numbers	And then were like Okay how do we put this and then we knew it couldnt be multiplication addition or subtraction	sd	5
And then were like Okay how do we put this and then we knew it couldnt be multiplication addition or subtraction	So then we just 540 divided by nine	sd	5
How many bags Are there a nine cartons		b	4
Can anyone hear me	I can hear you	sd	1
I can hear you	I can hear you	sd	1
Okay thats good	Yeah I can hear you	sd	1
Can you say that again	I didnt say anything	sd	1
I didnt say anything	I just asked if you stopped sharing	sd	1
Or to think about it	I did	sd	1
Okay Marcos can you explain to us how	I went up by 10s Because I went up by 10s and ones in each scarf	sd	5
I went up by 10s Because I went up by 10s and ones in each scarf	And when I got to 60 times nine I got the answer of 540	sd	5
Marcos so far	Yes	b	1
Yes	So Ill try 10s	sd	5
So Ill try 10s	And then I tried it until I got to nine	sd	5
And then I tried it until I got to nine	In the like 9 times 16	sd	5
Its on the chat	I can still hear you	sd	1
How many would that be		b	4
What is it		b	4
If 60 times nine equals 540 540 divided by nine equals what		b	4
		b	2
		b	2
All right put in the same room but you dont need to touch it okay	Thats like	ba	1
Okay Im putting this here but you dont need to touch it or anything okay	Okay	b	1
Did you finish your homework	Ah yes	b	1
I intentionally skipped it	Thank you	aa	1
Sound good everyone	Yes	b	1
All right joke of the day what do you call an elephant that doesnt matter	I dont know Mr G what	sd	1
An irrelephant	Oh	b	1
Oh	What of the other one	sd	1
It was appropriate	What do you call an elephant that does matter	sd	1
Patricks walking rate 0 0 1 2 2 9 figures right there 3 11 is that a straight line	No	b	1
Okay is that a straight line	No	b	1
Okay and then does the distance go up by the same amount every time	No	b	1
And then what	Seven	sd	4
Okay does that sound good everyone	Yes	b	1
Distance is the dependent variable and I would think of it in this problem as how far Jolene walked depends on how long shes been walking for	Dependent as in like depending	sd	4
Is this going to be a straight line	Yes	b	4
Does that happen the whole way down	Yes	b	1
Everybody agree so far	Yes	b	2
Three meters in two seconds whats the unit rate	15	b	4
15 what	Seconds	sd	4
Seconds	Wait meters	sd	4
Meters per	Meters per second	sd	4
Otis question	graph	aa	4
graph	You can easily notice that just by looking at it	sd	4
Judith and then Julianna	4C put it like plus three plus three plus three	sd	5
4C put it like plus three plus three plus three	Could you just make a line that covers all of them and say plus three	sd	5
Does this look like an equation that weve been talking about	Yes	b	1
225 meters	Per second	sd	4
Everybody agree	Yes	b	2
Is that going to look like a straight line	Yes	b	1
Is it going to be steeper or less steep than Jolenes	Less steep	sd	4
Less steep	More	aa	2
More	More	aa	2
More	Steeper	sd	2
Rio	It would be more steep because the number is  distance she walks faster	sd	5
Does this look like an equation that weve been looking at	No	b	1
Everybody agree 100 seconds	Yes	b	2
Will it take him 50 seconds	Yes	b	1
Everybody agree	Yes	b	2
What if he goes three meters per second	Itll take him 30 seconds	sd	4
Itll take him 30 seconds	333 seconds	sd	4
333 seconds	33333	b	4
Thats 13 of 100	Yes	b	2
Quentin	Can you demonstrate	sd	1
Four meters per second	25	b	4
Everybody agree	Yes	b	2
In elementary school young elementary school S doing the 100meter dash probably like 25 seconds	We were faster	sd	1
We were faster	We were a lot faster	sd	1
Five meters per second how long will it take	20 seconds	sd	4
The fastest middle schooler in this school probably can do the 100meter dash in like 12 seconds maybe	Definitely	aa	1
If you could switch	Will that mean if you go 10 meters per second you did 10 seconds	sd	5
10 meters per second is like you are really really really fast	Thats not natural	sd	1
Ripley	I did M  D x 15	sd	4
I did M  D x 15	Is that all the same thing	sd	4
Is that accurate	No	b	4
15 hats for 60	No	b	1
Five hats for 1	No	b	1
Three hats for 15	Yes	b	1
Does work	Going back on the first  I just wrote 5 per any distance	sd	4
Is that going to be a straight line	Yes	b	1
Yes its going to be this flat line right here	Are there any questions like the one youre showing right now could be a four question	sd	4
Okay table two every time x goes up by one is y going up or down by the same amount	No	b	1
Is that a straight line	No	b	1
Okay so your equation for this one is y equals x squared or y equals x times x which is kind of weird were not going to talk about these for a while after this but you might see them a little bit	Hey I got x by x	sd	4
Good	Could it be a constant of proportionality like for table number three it doesnt go to zero then but it would eventually go to zero	sd	5
No because for number three	Yes	b	1
Does 10 times 5 get you to this one	No	b	1
Yes	So if it doesnt constant a multiplier then it will go to zero	sd	5
Does that sound good everyone	Yes	b	1
Lets stay focused please	T	b	1
Yes	Mister can you add zero weeks to	sd	1
How are you men over here	Good	ba	1
Nice shades River	Oh thank you	aa	1

on my sandwich	Wed be having most W12 because youre withdrawing 12 each week	sd	5
Guys we need to focus	Minus 12 times W	sd	4
That doesnt have anything to do with which best part	Its a crisis what happened	sd	1
what else do we know about this task	Were using	sd	1
How can you put that in your equation	N144	b	4
And they use 12	Mine is 1200	sd	4

Here how are we doing	minus the transfer	sd	4
minus the transfer	First I bring it	sd	1
Sure thats perfect	Oh I get it	sd	1
Oh I get it	No you didnt	qy	1
Theres something wrong with that equation	I love it	sd	1
I love it	One year or neither	sd	4
One year or neither	One year	b	4
One year	Its proportional	sd	4
Its proportional	One year or neither	sd	4
One year or neither	But its one year	sd	4

Oscar sorry you got to your limited questions today	How do I do this question	sd	3
How do I do this question	Its that equation for	sd	1
I want you to talk to Mike there about that one	How do I	sd	1
Youre close on the equation	Okay	b	1
Theyre starting a month at 144 and then every week they loose 12 so youve got	What about this straight line	sd	3
What about this straight line	It says straight in not existent	sd	4
It says straight in not existent	Im sorry sir thats not straight	sd	4
Im sorry sir thats not straight	What the hell it is	sd	2
What the hell it is	Theres a tiny curve	sd	2
Theres a tiny curve	It is just straight	sd	4
It is just straight	I cant see anything	sd	1
I cant see anything	Is this little thing straight	sv	4
Oh I see that equation	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	I cant think	sd	1
You need 12 minus you need loosing 12 per week	144 minus 12	sd	4
144 minus 12	Oh all right	aa	1
Thats three youre going to change your answers for this	This is perfectly straight	sd	4
This is perfectly straight	I even did the math	sd	1
Thats December	I put it in season three but it didnt do anything	sd	1
I put it in season three but it didnt do anything	I hardly played at all then I played into	sd	1

Why do you carry around the backpack	This is only an emergency backpack	sd	1
This is only an emergency backpack	It has stuff in case I need it	sd	1
somebody share with us what you told me about equations	Yes sure	aa	1
Yes sure	It goes to down by a certain number	sd	1
It goes to down by a certain number	So that would be you put the  minus that number times	sd	1
Which one the last equation	This involves	sd	1
You made this one a little more complicated than you have to	decreases by 10 each	sd	4
All Im going to say then is your equation down here to be the same exact equation that you have here	This is what we started with then minus 12 times W	sd	4
Youre just changing this number and changing this number	it increases by 12 minusing that and then thats that	sd	4
The thing about  you can draw this arrow means multiplying by the same number for all of this	Mr G does this	sd	1
The camera or the like	It just says	sd	1

Ive got to plug in the	I dont know why  It looks like a fish	sd	1
Youre to stand somewhere so I know youre done	Okay and now five	sd	4
You guys done	Wait it will be the exact same answer wont it	sd	4
Wait it will be the exact same answer wont it	No because five divided by 15 equals	sd	2
So you can now join me on the floor	I was doing	sd	1
Tera	Yes	b	1
Please tell me what strategy or strategies you guys used to solve problem number one	So what we did is me and Dean here divided the  by the numerator in the rule	sd	4
In number one you divided	Yes	b	1
Yes	We did five divide by 15 and then one	sd	4
What answers did you get all the way down	Three four seven and two	sd	4
Okay because you did 15 divided by five is	Three	sd	4
35 divided by five is	Seven	sd	4
Everybody understand the strategy that they used	Yes	b	1
Paula explain the strategy you used	Me and my partner said five goes into 15 and  to 18 and five goes into 15 three times	sd	5
What	Dividing	aa	4
Linda	We did five times blank equals 15	sd	4
Bruce I called on you and you get one even though you because you said I did it the same way	Im done	sd	1
How many pairs are in there	Three	sd	4
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
What did you notice	the numerator are the same	sd	4
Even though they were a different process that they were asking you to do hey we have that they come out the same	doing 15 divided by five equals three and they just have one	sd	2
I would have to have different in numbers wouldnt I	Yes	b	1
Lisa what do you think	I think that because it would  would not be the same here	sv	5
If you disagree with Lisa show me with your hands	If you think	qy	1
Diana why do you disagree with Lisa	Because if you make 15 to 18 then it would give 16 of	sd	5
What would they be of six	Multiples	aa	4
All as Im doing is changing what Im multiplying	I dont think that it would give an outnumber that would be different	sd	4
I dont think that it would give an outnumber that would be different	Those could be the same	sd	4
Those could be the same	but I think it would be the in number	sd	4
If I changed it to 16 all of my in numbers would have to be multiples of six right	Yes	b	1
So because now I have 10 and five times two is 10 but its 02	More like a decimal	sd	4
Its now 15	divided by one would be one	sd	4
What could this be written as	15	b	4
Would it be 13 or would it be what	15	b	4
They made it a whole number so what would this one be	Three	sd	4
Georgia who are you with honey	Them	sd	1
Could you please explain that to me again	10 it goes 5   15  3 3 x 3  9	sd	5
10 it goes 5   15  3 3 x 3  9		b	2
	Then 3 x 15 is 45 and then 5	sd	5
Then 3 x 15 is 45 and then 5		b	2
Im going to give you 10 seconds to talk with	Do you want me to sit down	sd	1
What do you think	I think they will	sd	4
Thank you	For this one 15 x 3  45 and then if you divide that by 5 equals 9	sd	5
Breanna jump on in	5   15 is thee and 3 x 3 is nine	sd	5
Why did you have to do 3 x 3	Because	sd	1
Did you guys understand that	Yes	b	2
Did you all see that	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
Okay	3 x 15  45 and 5   45 is	sd	5
Does that make sense now	Yes	b	1
What is that person doing Kayla	I think theyre like I guess your example like if Im saying a different language	sd	4
Is that my color pencil you have in your mouth	No	b	1
Clay what are they telling me	Theyre telling you	sd	1
What is this drawing telling me	Theyre telling you that like	sd	1
Did your table group talk about anything Franc	Yes	b	1
What did your table group talk about Franc	We talked about that we that its telling us that theyre equal and when we knew that because were	sd	4
Whats the word for fractions	Theyre equivalent	sd	4
To interpret this you told me that I was looking at equivalent fractions right	Oh yes	b	1
Because I can take 13 I can break it into 26 and I can break it into 45	412	b	4
Does it	No	b	1
Do you love all these things we have to click to get where we need to go	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	1
All right so whats our number	791	b	4
Friends your voices are up	I need help	sd	3
Okay whats the number everybody	3568	b	4
Makes more sense doesnt it	Can I have another one	sd	1
Youre supposed to have two because I think you need it for each	The next one is explain your picture	sd	4

If I do it up here did I answer this one	Yes	b	1
They would be labeled	Is this graded	sd	1
Miriam you want to work with a partner or at the table	Ill work with a partner	sd	1
What partner are you going to pick Laura	Alexander	sd	1
Let me see your partnerships	Over here	sd	1
Miriam who are you working with	Here	sd	1
Kayla who are you working with	I dont know	sd	1
Who are you working with	Franc	sd	1
Does everybody have their papers	Yes	b	1
I know that its upsetting to you	I know the multiplication and all like the subtracting	sd	1
So youre thinking of connecting the box	Yes	b	1
Okay so how much do you think they took	312	b	4
How do you know they took 312	Because	sd	1
How much did group A take	They took	sd	1
Youre saying youre doing 112 eight times right	Yes	b	1
Remember all I do is multiply them across when Im multiplying I have to multiply straight across	Okay thats why	ba	1
Does that makes sense	Yes	b	1
I love your conversation that youre having but No wait tell me what youre doing dont do it just tell me what youre doing	To make the	sd	1
If I cover this up how many pieces did group B take	Three	sd	4
Three what	34	b	4
Im only showing you part of it what am I showing you right there	34	b	4
Of	Of three	sd	4
Because if I multiply this now	Roberto come on	sd	1
Roberto come on	Roberto	aa	1
Roberto	Roberto come on	sd	1
Do the math here so how do you multiply fractions	I know	aa	1
I know	You multiply the denominator of the casserole	sd	4
Does that number match that number	A way that he could do it to check your answer	sd	4
How did you figure out that its 58	I was going to do the denominator first so I did 2 x 4 which is 8	sd	5
I was going to do the denominator first so I did 2 x 4 which is 8	And then I did 4 x 1 for the numerator and I did that for 48	sd	5
And then I did 4 x 1 for the numerator and I did that for 48	And then I did 48  18 which equals 58	sd	5
Did you find one	Yeah	b	1
Anybody who watches Shark Tank	I used to	sd	1
I used to	Slightly	aa	1
Slightly	Yeah	aa	1
what do you know about Shark Tank	Its where people just go and show their invention so they can sell them	sd	1
And yeah  what else do you know about Shark Tank	Shark Tank is a group of millionaires that are investors and you get a chance to bring a company to a new area and you get to present your item or your business to the Shark Tank people and they buy successful companies	sd	1
Shark Tank is a group of millionaires that are investors and you get a chance to bring a company to a new area and you get to present your item or your business to the Shark Tank people and they buy successful companies	For example Kodiak cakes	sd	1
For example Kodiak cakes	They were a really small company	sd	1
They were a really small company	The guy on the screen and president hed buy 60 of them so basically they take a little companies and they make them bigger	sd	1
Wonderful because youre all be so good at determining prices	Or Mrs	sd	1
So this says to find the quotient mentally	Whats quotient again	sd	3
Carter how can I help you	I already answered	sd	1
I already answered	I was just	sd	1
So Saffron what do you think the answer could be	I think the answer could be	sd	1
Even if you give an estimate thats okay	I think the answer could be around 10	sd	4
Charlie what do you think	20	b	4
Aysa what do you think	25	b	4
Ray what do you think	Does it have to be a rounding thing	sd	4
Whatever you think	22	b	4
what are your thoughts	I think 10 is too low because 10 times 12 is 120	sd	5
Okay	I think 25 is too high	sv	4
How come	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	I personally think its 20 and I think 25s	sd	4
Do you want to keep that one there for now	No I think thats too high	sv	4
No I think thats too high	Im blanking	b	3
Are you thinking maybe its in the ballpark close	Yeah	b	1
But a little too high	Yeah	b	1
what are you thinking	I think its 20	sv	4
So another vote for 23	I mean if 25 is too high Im not really sure but I think it might be 23 too	sd	5
Okay	Around that area	sd	4
This is what Carter just did	12 times 10 equals 120	sd	5
Okay keep going	If you add 120 again	sd	4
So can we say another 12 times 10	Yeah so 12 times 10	aa	5
Yeah so 12 times 10	So basically 12 times 20	sd	5
So basically 12 times 20	That would equal 240	sd	5
Okay	And then half of 12 is six	sd	5
And then half of 12 is six	So mentally wouldnt it be 205 or 20 and a half	sd	5
Tell me what it looks like	So it was 246	sd	4
So it was 246	I divided by 12 so	sd	4
I divided by 12 so	Yeah	b	1
Tell me what to do next	So then I know that 12 times 24 or 12 into 24 two times	sd	5
Okay	So then you have six remaining and you can not do four times six so it would be times zero so 20 remainder six	sd	5
what do you notice or wonder	The numbers on these are quite big and eye catching	sd	1
The numbers on these are quite big and eye catching	They are the main center of it besides  the numbers are really upfront	sd	1
Are they big numbers or are they small numbers	They are small numbers	sd	4
They didnt want to have one thats super expensive right	Yeah	b	1
That would make it much easier to compute	Yeah	b	1
What do you notice or wonder	It kind of looks they are fractions	sd	4
What could we describe those as	Deals	sd	4
I like it	Could it be division	sd	4
Zane	You could also use them for	sd	4
You could also use them for	For every two batches of strawberries you get 3	sd	4
For every two batches of strawberries you get 3	Ratios	sd	4
Ratios	Ratios	sd	2
This is a ratio here	Thats two thirds	sd	4
We would say for every two containers of strawberries you would pay 3	Yeah	b	1
That would be the most delicious strawberry you could ever have in the world	If you want 9 sodas it would cost 33	sd	5
If you want 9 sodas it would cost 33	I did the sum quickly	sd	1
If you look very closely its nine cases of soda	Oh nine cases	sd	1
I think if I look carefully we would have a 12 pack	That one	sd	1
Carter what are you thinking	So Im thinking basically the store is trying to make a profit by saying	sd	5
So Im thinking basically the store is trying to make a profit by saying	So basically it probably winter right now for the strawberries and its summer for the potential buyers	sd	5
So basically it probably winter right now for the strawberries and its summer for the potential buyers	Its a holiday with the soda and its winter with the strawberries because the store is trying to make a profit because the strawberries arent growing right now and they are just trying to get rid of them	sd	5
Its a holiday with the soda and its winter with the strawberries because the store is trying to make a profit because the strawberries arent growing right now and they are just trying to get rid of them	So theyre not making extra by one for 3 and two for 6 and	sd	5
They are giving you a deal	Yeah	b	1
Im not sure what time of year this came from but I would also add on to that to say that theyre saying two for 3	Ms it wouldnt be on 9 sodas	sd	5
Ms it wouldnt be on 9 sodas	It would be 72 because nine times eight each package has eight	sd	5
It would be 72 because nine times eight each package has eight	You can see the eight on top	sd	5
You can see the eight on top	Nine times eight is 72 for 33 because you buy in packages	sd	5
Was it a 12 pack or an eight pack	Yeah	b	1
Thats some great thinking you should go grocery shopping for your family to find the best deals	Are these strawberries for free	sd	1
Love them	No	b	1
Are you allergic	No I just dont like them	sd	1
what do you think they are	I just dont have a	sd	1
what do you think the two things are	Maybe money and avocados	sd	4
what do you think	Eight avocados and 4	sd	4
What can we do to get our number of avocados to 16	We can multiply eight two times	sd	4
And well multiply it keep going sweetie	To get 16 and then four maybe times	sd	4
Charlie whats your thoughts	So you know that four avocados is eight so that means and then four	sd	5
Say your first part to me again	Four is the price for eight avocados	sd	4
Okay keep going Charlie	And that is four	sd	4
Thats awesome	Ms Davies Z has hurt his eye because he got an eyelash stuck in his eye	sd	1
Well if he needs to go to the restroom to take care of that he is more than welcome to do that	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Did anyone else have a different strategy to get to 20	I did	sd	2
Yeah Aysa what did you do	First of all I did eight at the very beginning times two four times two that got me eight and 16	sd	5
First of all I did eight at the very beginning times two four times two that got me eight and 16	Then I divided column one by two and that got me four and two and then I added eight and two and 16 and four separately which got me with all  20	sd	5
Then I divided column one by two and that got me four and two and then I added eight and two and 16 and four separately which got me with all  20	And then eight plus two is obviously 10 and then I got the same answer	sd	5
Annabel can you reiterate it	Okay so I think this what he meant to say	sv	2
He did that very fast	Eight avocados cost 4	sd	5
Eight avocados cost 4	And then 16 avocados cost 8	sd	5
And then 16 avocados cost 8	Wrong way round	sd	1
Wrong way round	I can explain it slowly	sd	1
I can explain it slowly	And half of it is 2	sd	4
Okay so pick up this and divide by two right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	16 plus four is 20 and then its half of the cost so its 2	sd	5
16 plus four is 20 and then its half of the cost so its 2	10	b	5
So he said his next step was actually to go to get to eight and divide this by two	I think so	sv	1
Okay and then Annabel and then what did he do next	And then added it onto the cost	sd	2
And then I think he added together this column here and this column here to get to 20	Yeah	b	1
He just wrote back and he said Correct good job	You need a little bit more than 10 to buy them	sd	4
Well how come you need a little more than 10	Because you have to pay the taxes	sd	5
So next time you have a family member go to the store ask them to see their receipts because depending on how your food is prepared the tax works differently which is kind of a cool thing about food	Ms Davies	sd	1
Yes	I have a different strategy	sd	2
What was your strategy	Well I counted eight times three to give me 24 and that was too much avocados and I realized that it just count four and a half to get 20 avocados and that was 10	sd	5
Im running out of colors	I think I might have	sd	1
Crew nice work	I solved it	sd	1
Two words and two numbers when you set up your ratio table	What are we	sd	1
So flip your page over and youll see it on your desk	How many should we have	sd	3
How many should we have	Didnt you say how many we should have	sd	2
Didnt you say how many we should have	Two words	sd	2
Can you tell me what two words were going to use in our ratio table	Large bottles	sd	4
Yeah we can just do bottles if we want to	Okay and then the cost of the bottle	sd	4
What information has been provided for us in the introduction to the problem	There are 12 water bottles	sd	4
There are 12 water bottles	So theres 12 of them	sd	4
Okay	And the water costs 9	sd	4
Zizi how can we do this in one step	Well I just saw that nine and 12	sd	4
Well I just saw that nine and 12	They both have multiples of three I think	sd	4
We could say theyre both divisible	12 divided by three is four and nine divided by three is three	sd	5
12 divided by three is four and nine divided by three is three	And 4 to three bottles	sd	5
And 4 to three bottles	Yeah three bottles for 4	sd	5
What do you think Zane	The last problem	sd	4
And for every one word she said he said seven	For every one wipe theres two sprays	sd	4
Tess what are your thoughts	Divide by three	sd	4
What could we do	Divide by four	sd	4
So how much is three fourths of a dollar	75 cents	sd	4
How did you get that Riley	Well if you split a dollar in four 75 would be the third out of the four	sd	5
So Im going to give you some time to think about that	Can we write on our paper	sd	1
Zizi lets hear your thinking	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I took the four bottles that we already have because it cost 3	sd	5
So I took the four bottles that we already have because it cost 3	I think I messed up	sd	4
I think I messed up	Okay	b	1
Okay	But I still have to get three	sd	5
But I still have to get three	Because theres four bottles and now I know I need three bottles to get seven bottles	sd	5
Because theres four bottles and now I know I need three bottles to get seven bottles	My mistake was is that I added the four instead of the three	sd	5
My mistake was is that I added the four instead of the three	But now I realize that I could just take 75 cents away from three and added them to get 525	sd	5
What would be the number model for that	One fourth plus two fourths equals three fourths	sd	5
Lydia	Thats a half an hour	sd	4
And someone who is willing to explain how they know their sum is correct	What I did was 5 sixths plus 2 sixths equals 7 sixths	sd	5
How do you know youre correct	Cause if you just get rid of the sixths and you just add five plus two it equals seven	sd	5
Cause if you just get rid of the sixths and you just add five plus two it equals seven	Then you just add the sixths	sd	5
Okay can you think of a model or a tool that you can use to predict	You could use fraction circles	sd	4
Caleb	I did three sixths plus four sixths equals seven sixths	sd	5
And how do you know its true	Because regularly three plus four equals seven	sd	5
Joey did formulating	I technically included a whole	sd	4
A whole	Uhhuh	b	1
How do you know that thats correct	Because one whole equals 6 sixths and if you add one sixth that would be seven sixths	sd	5
Okay go ahead	So the first thing I did was four fifths plus one cause one is five fifths	sd	5
So the first thing I did was four fifths plus one cause one is five fifths	And five fifths plus four fifths is nine fifths	sd	5
You guys listen up	Then what I did was one half plus one half which made five fifths and two fifths and then I did another two fifths	sd	5
Awesome	That basically just breaks up this  nine fifths	sd	4
Joey	Were there even be a half	sd	4
Im sorry	Would there even be a half of a fifth	sd	4
So you also could do so what Im asking is can you think of any others	Like the x up in the top right corner	sd	1
Cooper	Could a half be eighths	sd	4
Whats another fraction for a half	Four eighths	aa	4
Two fourths plus four eighths plus	Four fifths	aa	4
So one strategy would be to look for fractions that you know like half that you can make a bunch of different denominators out of	I know another denominator for a half	sd	1
I know another denominator for a half	Three sixths	sd	4
Uh huh	Four eighths	aa	4
What is a different one	Eight	sd	4
What	Eight sixteenths	sd	4
You can talk to your neighbor about some of the fractions you think might work	You could do five twelfths plus five twelfths I guess	sd	4
You could do five twelfths plus five twelfths I guess	Five twelfths plus five twelfths	sd	4
Five twelfths plus five twelfths	Seven twelfths	sd	2
Seven twelfths	We could do 4 8ths plus two	sd	4
We could do 4 8ths plus two	Four 8ths	sd	4
Four 8ths	Oh yeah	b	2
Oh yeah	Five plus six plus	sd	2
These are not easy to do are they	Mrs Gibson	aa	1
Mrs Gibson	Im pretty sure they can just go together if you get them close enough	sd	1
Im pretty sure they can just go together if you get them close enough	Oh I know what you have to do	sd	1
Is this a sixth	Yeah its a sixth	sd	4
Yeah its a sixth	Look up there	sd	1
Look up there	Its the same colors	sd	1
Its the same colors	Its light blue	sd	1
What else did you have Tom	I did four eighths plus 3	sd	4
Four 8ths plus 3	Two 8ths	sd	4
Did you say four eighths	Yep	b	1
Yep	Four 8ths plus four plus three 8ths	sd	4
Plus two fourths	Two eighths	sd	4
This is three twelfths right	Uhhuh	b	1
Parker	What I did kind of was I had two sixths I had two thirds	sd	4
Two twelfths	One sixth	sd	4
Okay so he would get to X out this one	And a third	sd	4
Page three oh three	You can just click up top	sd	1
If I click on that	Yeah I believe itll take you to it	sd	1
Yeah I believe itll take you to it	Go down there and do the pages right there	sd	1
Go down there and do the pages right there	Youve got to delete	sd	1
I want to see you write something down please	What is the unit rate again	sd	3
What are the two things that the dog is comparing	Tricks and treats	sd	4
What are we going to put for the cat	Okay	b	1
Okay	So the cats ratio is two tricks is 16 to four	sd	5
So the cats ratio is two tricks is 16 to four	So every four tricks I mean every two or three series three	sd	5
What is our progress on	Its four	sd	4
Its four	One trick she does she gets four	sd	4
And then for our problem we can say 16 and then your right we can divide both of these by four	So for every one trick she	sd	1
And now if these were a treat that you really liked Micah would you rather be the dog or be the cat	Probably the cat	sd	4
How come	Because in the long run youd get more	sd	5
Well even in the short term right	Yeah at least she doesnt need to do eight tricks as the same amount as the dog so its basically doubled	sd	5
How come the dog gets more treats	Cause the dog does more tricks so more treats	sd	5
So youre saying that overall since the dog is doing more tricks they get more treats	Yeah	b	1
So the dog has to work harder right	Yeah	b	1
Did anybody tackle the hamster problem	Sure	b	1
Okay	It should be 14 to four	sd	4
14 every 14 tricks they would get four	That would be three and a half and one	sd	4
Thank you Micah and Neil	I didnt really know where my note catcher is	sd	1
So in the meantime you can take notes on a separate sheet of paper okay	Okay	b	1
Charlie turn your cameras on please	I dont have mine	sd	1
Hey Micah when someone says unit rates what does that mean to you	Just 54 right	b	1
55	Okay	b	1
Okay	What was the question	sd	3
What are unit rates	I dont really know	sd	3
What were we trying to scale it down to	Oh we were trying to figure out what like its hard to describe	sd	1
Oh we were trying to figure out what like its hard to describe	Were trying to	sd	1
Were trying to	I dont really know how to explain it	sd	3
What do you think of Paulina	Like you have two numbers and youre trying to find the comparison I would say	sd	4
Frankie what do you think what unit rate is	Basically how much of something that theyre getting from one	sd	4
Yeah Peter	I think its the hard version of a ratio	sd	4
What is it cam	How many miles you can go on one gallon of gas	sd	4
And do you want that number to be higher or do you want it to be lower	Higher	aa	4
So like big trucks do they have a high or low MPG	Low	aa	4
What do you think about those	Itll be high	sd	4
Itll be high	Because	sd	1
Im guessing her car is a little bit bigger not huge but it is a little bigger	Thats not terrible	sd	1
Whatd you get	156	b	4
Hey can you tell us how you got 156	I mean I dont know	sd	3
I mean I dont know	I just thought of what number plus what number will equal to 312	sd	4
Yeah Quintin	Two divided by 156 I think its 78	sd	5
You tell me how you got 78	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Well Half of 150	sd	5
Well Half of 150	So like 75	sd	5
Okay so you split 156 into 150 and six	Yeah then I got like 75	sd	4
So two groups of 75	and then I got a three and added that on 75	sd	4
Thats really good	Ill do one	sd	1
Lets do it	26	b	4
Okay so we divide both of these by three	What I did was I took 312 right	sd	5
What I did was I took 312 right	And I did a kind of a different way than you guys probably	sd	5
And I did a kind of a different way than you guys probably	But I saw how many times with 6 going to 312	sd	5
Were dividing by three here	Well Im doing math just a different way	sd	1
Okay	So six goes into 350 times	sd	4
Okay	And then six goes into 12 twice	sd	5
And then six goes into 12 twice	So 50 thats 50 plus two 52 and half of that is 26	sd	5
Not much better but a little bit right	Right	b	1
Okay	Im not sure can I have help	sd	3
What question would you like to ask me	I just dont really understand	sd	3
So how many miles per gallon did Sammys mom get	230	b	4
How much did she get for one gallon	23	b	4
Hey gentlemen listen please	26	b	4
26 so who can go more miles on a gallon of gas	Frankies	sd	4
So from our first column to our second column Lilani what did we do from our first column to our second column	Oh divided	b	4
Yeah what did we divide it by	4	b	4
What did we do Leo to get from the second column to the third column	Divided by four	sd	4
We divided by four again	One divided by four is 25 cents	sd	5
Paulina what could we divide both of those by	We could divide it by four	sd	4
Do you guys want to do four	Or six	sd	4
So what is 12 divided by four	Three	sd	4
Divided by four right	Divided by four	sd	4
Yeah	I thought 12 divided by four is three	sd	5
That to be a little bit easier	I think thats a little differently	sv	1
Thats all right	I did 12 divided by three	sd	4
So 12 divided by three is four and then	325 divided by three is 108	sd	5
Can you tell us I got a dollar and 8 cents	I simply just divide it	sd	4
What would that be	54 cents	sd	4
So what should we do	Divide it again	sd	4
Well should we divide it by	Two	sd	4
Yeah Quintin	Could it be accomplished both the four and the two by just dividing it by six	sd	4
You know what if you can do divided by six and you can do it mentally in your head yes	Thats what I did	sd	1
But youre not doing a lot of work off to the side cause you want to make this efficient	Okay	b	1
You got to compare miles per gallon	So it would be a half	sd	4
So it would be a half	You could turn it into a half of 12	sd	4
Kennedy	I agree with Cassandra because an equivalent I kind of think of an equal when the two fractions are equivalent equal together	sd	5
I said three I think	Im going to do four just for the fun of it	sd	1
Okay	Im going to leave one more	sd	1
Show me your boards	Im done	sd	1
Im done	My arm hurts	sd	1
Cecilia	I got three twelfths	sd	4
Harrison can you say what Cecilia just said	No	b	1
Cecilia can you say that again	I got three twelfths	sd	4
How did you get threetwelfths	I got it by I know that	sd	1
Claire why do you agree	I agree because thats also one of the things I got	sd	2
If I was to show my work how would I do that	I put down one fourth like a circle and then I made twelfths slice and I colored in three of them	sd	5
I put down one fourth like a circle and then I made twelfths slice and I colored in three of them	I saw that it was equal because I wasnt sure at first	sd	5
Harrison	Another way that it got was one fourth times three	sd	4
One different than three twelfths	Two eighths	sd	4
Two eighths do we agree	Yes	b	1
I know we love doing the millions over the millions but lets just try to do reasonable ones	Im going to do trillions	sd	4
Im going to do trillions	four and ask questions	sd	1
four and ask questions	How are they getting	sd	1
How are they getting	I know	aa	1
I know	Do quadrillion	sd	2
Kerry whats one equivalent fraction you got	I got four sixths	sd	4
Do we agree	I got 150240	sd	4
Harrison	1624	b	4
Step by step	You do it horizontally	sd	4
I know these mics and	Do you hold it down	sd	1
Hugh what did you and your partner talk about	We talked about how to find an equivalent fraction	sd	5
We talked about how to find an equivalent fraction	You want to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	sd	5
Landon can you respond to what Hugh just said	No	b	1
Hugh can you repeat that	Yes	b	1
Yes	We talked about for the algorithm we have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	sd	4
So step one multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number	Thats the only step	sd	4
Thats the only step	Step two you have your answer	sd	4
Elaine	Adding on to Hugh me and Kennedy talked about multiplying across	sd	2
Good	to get to the product	sd	4
Does everyone agree	Yes	b	2
Three	I can explain why the multiplication rule for equivalent fractions work	sd	1
Put your lid on your marker	I think that theyre multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number which is three	sd	4
What did you and your partner say	We talked about how	sd	1
We talked about how	We talked about how like lets say we have two fifths you times it by the same number like	sd	4
Harrison bring me your whiteboard and marker	Times the numerator by the same number as you times the denominator	sd	4
Fiona	We talked about how maybe the rule could be when you multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number	sd	4
Using our text clues what do we think concise means	Its like correct	sd	4
London	Certain	aa	4
Cecilia	Being reasonable	sd	4
Elaine	Efficient	sd	4
Efficient	Efficient	sd	1
Without explaining and explaining this is one of the times where you can make one or two sentences and wrap it up with specific words and concise	Yes	b	1
Yes	That sounds so good	sd	1
Everyone say Multiplicative	Multiplicative	sd	1
Multiplicative	Multiplicative	sd	1
Now say Multiplicative identity property	Multiplicative identity property	sd	1
We kind of went through it yesterday on accident because it came up	That means if you multiply a number by one like if you multiply three by one itd be three no matter what	sd	4
Jonas	Answer to a multiplication problem	sd	4
Thats our challenge is not moving ahead	This is it	sd	1
This is it	Page 184	aa	1
Person B raise your hand	Its not right	sd	1
Go	I didnt get D yet	sd	1
I didnt get D yet	I didnt get the answer	sd	1
I didnt get the answer	You have B	sd	1
You have B	Oh B	b	1
Oh B	B	b	1
B	I thought five times two and one thirds	sd	4
I thought five times two and one thirds	Ten and one third	sd	4
Ten and one third	I feel like exactly	sd	1
I feel like exactly	I want to say its five dogs	sd	4
I want to say its five dogs	Actually wait	sd	1
Actually wait	Oh its not five	sd	4
Oh its not five	I think five times  is equal	sd	4
Cassandra which one do you think was the hardest to answer and why	I think the hardest one to answer was D	sd	4
Kennedy	I agree with Cassandra because when all the other ones is like five times five fourths as a large number in spite of  numbers	sd	2
Faye	Five is greater because if you do five times one half its five tenths	sd	5
Five is greater because if you do five times one half its five tenths	Five is bigger because its a whole number	sd	5
Because if you multiply five by a half it would be five over two	Because five times two is 10	sd	5
Why do you say less	Because five is greater than five times 81 so thats Oh its inequivalent	sd	5
So 86 over 7 is what Madison	If youre doing five times 86 over seven its only one away from a whole so it will be really close to five but its not	sd	5
If youre doing five times 86 over seven its only one away from a whole so it will be really close to five but its not	Its a little bit less than five	sd	5
Now look at B Landon what did you put for B	For B I said that five times two and one third was bigger than five	sd	4
Jonas	The reason why its bigger because not only are you multiplying it by two which makes it 10 youre also multiplying it by a third which makes it	sd	5
Class answer	Equal	b	4
Go	So I did what is it	sd	1
So I did what is it	Three thirds	sd	4
Oh and a number as the numerator that seem as the denominator	No	b	1
No	Thats over	ba	1
Thats over	The same number	sd	4
The same number	Its three thirds	sd	4
Its three thirds	Four fourths	sd	2
Four fourths	Is your fraction you grow in part with A to write three fractions youre going to	sv	4
Go	Okay	b	1
Okay	Four fourths	sd	4
Four fourths	Its three thirds	sd	2
Its three thirds	Okay	b	1
Okay	Mine was a hundred hundredth	sd	2
Mine was a hundred hundredth	Eightyeight eighty	aa	2
Eightyeight eighty	Yes	b	1
Yes	Four fourths	sd	2
Four fourths	You said fourth eighteenths	sd	2
Deborah what did you hear that was shared	I heard	sd	1
I didnt hear you	I heard three over threes	sd	4
Landon what did you hear your table group say	Twelvetwelve	sd	4
Madison	Two halves	sd	4
Two over two	Yes	b	1
Elaine	Ten tenths	sd	4
Talk to your face partner	Same numbers that were talking about	sd	4
Elaine	I think it relates to equivalent fractions because three over three is equal to one and	sd	5
Three over three is equal to one	Yes and if you three thirds one is a whole and three over three if you have a pizza and you eat three out of three then you eat the whole pizza for example	sd	5
Yes and if you three thirds one is a whole and three over three if you have a pizza and you eat three out of three then you eat the whole pizza for example	Thats equivalent because	sd	5
How was your thinking different	I think that our thinking was different because I said that the numerator and denominator are the same but therefore you could multiply and add the exact same	sd	5
I think that our thinking was different because I said that the numerator and denominator are the same but therefore you could multiply and add the exact same	I think its similar because we both kind of thought of the same thing	sd	5
I think its similar because we both kind of thought of the same thing	I would like to add on to both of them because when I think of finding equivalent fractions I know that you have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	sd	2
I would like to add on to both of them because when I think of finding equivalent fractions I know that you have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	So say you have one fourth and you want to find the equivalent fraction you multiply the one by three and then the four by three which is equivalent to one and youll have an equivalent fraction	sd	5
So did you multiply the four and five then	This	sd	4
This	This bottom line	sd	4
What is the bottom line	Two	sd	4
Four times four is	Eight	aa	4
Eight	I know	aa	1
I know	Sixteen	aa	2
Five times four is	Twenty	sd	4
Did anyone put the multiplicative identity property in their rule	Well you never really told us what it was	sd	1
Just for a second	We have no room	sd	1
We have no room	Wait until Sky is through	sd	1
Madison	it relates to because you basically multiply a whole which is equal to one so	sd	5
Did you hear Madison	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
One fourth times three over three is	Three twelves	sd	4
Math boxes and then partner check	Please tell me youre kidding	sd	1
Please tell me youre kidding	Right	b	1
Right	Its 913	sd	1
Its 913	We actually have four to six hours	sd	1
Well lets get started with our work for today	Ms	b	1
Ms	I have a question	sd	1
Whats up	Did you see mine because I kind of did it later at night	sd	1
You know what I will send you an email after I check it	Okay	b	1
Oh okay	For example if you had like a mixture of	sd	4
I liked your  what was your for every example	For every three peas one green bean	sd	5
in your Google Classroom	Yeah	b	1
My other classes will not run into that problem now	Yeah	b	1
As long as I can see your work on  you may	Got it	sd	1
But I want you to tell me how would you think about sorting these different little shapes	I have a question	sd	3
Yes whats your question	I dont really get how  so its telling me like look at all the colors and figure out how many groups	sd	3
I dont really get how  so its telling me like look at all the colors and figure out how many groups	But then what do you do on that	sd	3
How many different areas do you have	Whats an area	sd	3
This one has an area of two	So I need to add all of them together	sd	4
So I would see how many different areas you have	Okay	b	1
Dexter have many different color groups do you see	I see four	sd	4
What colors do you see	Green red blue and yellow	sd	4
Lindsey	How are you supposed to like find the groups of area	sd	3
And then I see some shapes that have an area of three	Theres a green one and a red one	sd	4
Dexter did you think of another category	No	b	1
Yeah Cooper	By their shapes	sd	4
So that would kind of be sorting it by color right	Yeah	b	1
Lindsey can you talk about your different categories	Sure	b	1
Sure	So the first time I did was color	sd	4
So the first time I did was color	And then I did type height and width	sd	4
And then I did type height and width	And just	sd	1
What do you guys think	Theres seven different types	sd	4
Abrahm can you tell us why you think that the two and the four are switched in the first two ratio statements	The two and the four	sd	1
Yeah	Because the two and the four is  understand why its a smaller number like in front	sd	5
Because the two and the four is  understand why its a smaller number like in front	I dont get that part	sd	3
Do you see in the first statement how purple come first	Yeah	b	1
Thats awesome	Its just kind of a collection of random point shoes	sd	4
Charlie can you read your first one	The whole	sd	1
The one that starts with the ratio of pencils	Oh	b	1
Oh	I have the ratio of pencils to colored pencils is 12 to nine	sd	5
You have 12 pencils and nine colored pencils	Yeah	b	1
Elise can you read yours for us	Mine is the ratio of size five soccer balls to size four balls is three to two	sd	5
Colette can you read yours for us	Yes	b	1
Yes	So I put the ratio of prepointe shoes to pointe shoes is one to three	sd	5
You have three prepointe shoes	I have one pair of prepointe shoes and three pairs of pointe shoes	sd	4
So you have two notebooks	Yes	b	1
Arthur will you read yours for us	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Mine was the ratio of footballs to basketballs is five to 14	sd	5
You have 14 basketballs	Yeah	b	1
Do you want to read these two Calvin	The ratio of pencils to pens is two to one	sd	5
The ratio of pencils to pens is two to one	And the ratio of spare masks to headphones is one to two	sd	5
For Abrahm I want you to try and use the word to or you can start your sentence with for every	Okay	b	1
Colette good job with your equivalent ratio with cats and mice	What were the words again	sd	3
If you could have your homework and your calendar on your desk that would be very helpful	Hey Im not	sd	1
Hey Im not	2740	b	4
2740	We are just looking at the same lesson on  it must have a mike on thats the problem	sd	1
What	Wait Im still confused can I ask you a question	sd	3
Hey Will theres more in the orange basket	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Of course you can its your turn	sv	1
Can you wait and ask in front of everyone else in case someone has your same question	Sure	b	1
Okay	I have two of them	sd	1
Im happy to answer them	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	I didnt have my homework  yesterday	sd	1
I didnt have my homework  yesterday	seen my homework	sd	1
Okay	All my work on the school page in here  Its pretty very much  much	sd	1
You can get it back	Finish it right now	aa	1
looking at	Wait why is there a missing  the homework here	sd	1
Thank you to those of you who have a pen out	I dont have a magic pen	sd	1
Yes	For the last one	sd	1
For the last one	I got that he had 10 pieces of fabric and 13 leftover	sd	4
Did you have five and 13 divided by 35 as your sentence	Yes I think so	sv	1
Did you write it as an improper fraction and get 163 divided by 35	Hold on	sd	1
You look at it for a minute and Ill be back to review okay	Yes	b	1
Yes	The last one I did get eight and 89 but then I had trouble getting to how much pieces	sd	4
The last one I did get eight and 89 but then I had trouble getting to how much pieces	To getting the pieces I did 35 divided by 89	sd	4
For the second parts	Yes	b	1
Your first part is your five and 13 that youre going to divide into pieces that are the size of 35	Yes and then I did get eight and 89	sd	4
If each thing that youre making needs 35 of a yard of fabric youre going to find 89 of 35	Which is division except	sd	4
You have 89 for your next one or you have 89 of the 35 that are needed	You put down  solution	sd	1
You can make eight pieces and then youll have 89 of your next piece which means that you used 815 of a yard	Okay	b	1
Hey Olivia whats up	Yes I found my answer	sd	1
Yes I found my answer	Im	sd	1
Yes	What I did was four and 16 divided by 23	sd	4
What I did was four and 16 divided by 23	I first find the common denominator of 12 and then I  fraction	sd	4
Youll just have more simplifying to do at the end	I think I got it	sd	1
Did you get the right answer	Yes	b	1
Can you bring it up here	got the wrong answer and then he figured it out	sd	2
Kyle do you want to tell us about what your model means	Okay	b	1
Okay tell us what your model means	There is one pizza	sd	4
There is one pizza	You can make one pizza here wait	sd	4
It looks like you start off with four and 16 cups of cheese	You can make one pizza over this much	sd	5
You can make one pizza over this much	Two pizzas here three here four here five here six here and I have this one and 23 at first and then so there was 12 and the 13	sd	5
Two pizzas here three here four here five here six here and I have this one and 23 at first and then so there was 12 and the 13	Then I split it into six and then I cut one and it was 12	sd	5
If he has 16 leftover thats 14 of what he needs for his next pizza	Thats what I meant to say	sd	1
We are about to embark on a Woot Math Poll today	Yes	b	1
Glad youre excited	The Woot math polls	sd	1
Kyle can you give me one thing	its better  desks like all together and theyre like total	sd	4
Then can I say could we use the phrase do you agree	I do	sd	2
I do	I do	sd	2

Or everyone can get something right right	Then everyone gets a win thats just a communism	sd	1
Then everyone gets a win thats just a communism	Thats what boosts are for	sd	1
Thats what boosts are for	Guys were beating you with boosts and you have more players	sd	1
Now when you put in your answer only include the fraction no labels please	Are they splitting	sd	1
If its the one you told me youre doing great	So wait its this right	sd	1
So wait its this right	Its like this	sd	1
Its like this	Okay then you did it wrong because both Kai and I got 38	sd	2
Okay then you did it wrong because both Kai and I got 38	If we lose its me Drew	sd	1
If we lose its me Drew	Im not  for this one	sd	1
Im not  for this one	If we lose we cant blame it on Tucker because we dont want to take responsibility like a normal person	sd	1
If we lose we cant blame it on Tucker because we dont want to take responsibility like a normal person	I will take responsibility	sd	1
I will take responsibility	Then youre not normal	sd	1
Then youre not normal	Its a Jolly ranger	sd	1
Oh so slow	I told you	aa	1
I told you	We got the tie breaker	sd	1
Thank you very much	This is treason	sd	1
Equivalent is what	Equal	b	4
So fractions that are equal and how do you figure out whether fractions are equal	They lead to the same answer	sd	4
Why do we need to know how to make equivalent fractions if were adding fractions	Because if theyre not equivalent and if they have different denominators like one and six you cant add them together	sd	5
So in this particular fraction the five is what is the five the five is the	Denominator	aa	4
Could you explain to us why how do you know that three fourths is bigger than one half	Because two fourths is a half so	sd	5
How did you know two fourths was a half	one fourth in there so	sd	4
And how do you do How did you know how to figure	A half is four eighths	sd	5
A half is four eighths	That means that three eighths is less than a half	sd	5
Landon can you explain to us how you know two thirds is greater than a half	I know because if you look at the fraction circle chart you can see that two thirds is bigger than a half	sd	5
I know because if you look at the fraction circle chart you can see that two thirds is bigger than a half	So but the problem is two thirds and then one half and two thirds goes right here and one half goes right here	sd	5
Show me	I figures out to  down because I was doing this	sd	4
Hey Joey can you tell us how you knew that 14 plus two fourths was bigger than a half	One fourth plus two fourths is three fourths equals bigger than one half	sd	5
How do you know that	Because three fourths is one fourth more than a half	sd	5
Show me	I preferred the other problem	sd	1
Okay Aiden do you want to tell us	I knew that one half is half  of one whole	sd	5
I knew that one half is half  of one whole	Then I knew that was not half or above	sd	5
Then I knew that was not half or above	So then I knew	sd	5
Can you add and subtract denominators	No	b	1
So if you start with a half what does it take to make a whole	Another half	sd	4
Is a third bigger or smaller than a half	Smaller	sd	4
Cooper	So three fourths would be bigger than two thirds	sd	5
So three fourths would be bigger than two thirds	So three thirds or three fourths	sd	5
If we start with two thirds whats it take what do you need to add to two thirds to get to one	One 13	sd	4
Is that bigger than 13	Yeah	b	1
How do you know what a fourth is	Because	sd	1
Okay tell me how you know for sure what a fourth is	Okay	b	1
Okay	A whole is four of fourths	sd	4
Okay so you are supposed to figure out what a fourth plus an eighth is Landon	Oh	b	1
Oh	Can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
I didnt have I didnt hear anybody talking to your partners	To make one fourth	sd	4
To make one fourth	Wait one fourth equals two eighths	sd	2
Wait one fourth equals two eighths	I agree	aa	2
What is that	Thats one fourth	sd	4
Okay	And if you take	sd	1
Whats that	One eighth	sd	4
Okay	And another one eighth is three	sd	4
Come on up	All of these	sd	4
All of these	And you have to set up the circle	sd	4
Okay	And there are two eighths remaining from this	sd	4
And there are two eighths remaining from this	Two eighths equals one fourth	sd	4
What I see out here is  we have a fifth plus are these tenths	Yes	b	1
So what size is that	Fifths	aa	4
And that is what five	Its a fifth	sd	4
Mia	Its thirds	sd	4
What size is common to both of them	Sixths	sd	4
Okay so your assignment did I get those page back	Yeah	b	1
Asher	Like three fourths	sd	4
Quinn	The first one says one half of three the second one says one half of three fourths	sd	4
The first one says one half of three the second one says one half of three fourths	And its not a whole number	sd	4
Have we done a fraction of a fraction yet	No	b	1
See if you can solve number one and two	I think you just add three to it	sv	4
Bom ba da bom bom	Bombom	sd	1
Mason	I noticed that one half of three  one half of three over one	sd	5
I noticed that one half of three  one half of three over one	And then multiply those together to get three halves	sd	5
One half of three over one would be three over two which is then what	One and one half	sd	4
Miles	Depends  Because its an odd number the three is you have to go all the way back to another number that would get it remotely close to three fourths which in my opinion would be	sd	5
Did we have to find a common denominator when multiplying up here	No	b	1
Three times one	Three	sd	4
Two times four	Eight	sd	4
Whats our answer	Three eighths	sd	4
Cooper	Because we cant  and you really cant split  so you just three times eight	sd	5
Because we cant  and you really cant split  so you just three times eight	eight and half of six eighths would be three eighths	sd	5
Bom ba da bom bom	Bom bom	sd	1

So much of the whole granola bar is he giving to his brother	One fourth	sd	4
So if Larry had one half of a granola bar and he decided to give one half to his brother his brother ends up getting one fourth of oh I guess it was a fruit bar	Can it be a chocolate bar	sd	1
Can it be a chocolate bar	Can it be chocolate	sd	1
Mason	We were trying to find the other half of the half so one fourth	sd	5
Natalie	We were trying to find the half of the half	sd	4
Why were we trying to find half of the fruit bar at the beginning	So we could split it in two	sd	4
Hadley	Because Larry had a half of a bar	sd	5
Ariana	His brother wanted half	sd	4
Brendan	Because  folded it in the line	sd	5
Because  folded it in the line	Because one half of a half is	sd	5
How much of the whole pizza did she eat	I hope its not vegetarian	sd	1
Daniel	So has half of the veggie pizza	sd	4
So first what do we need to do with our paper	Fold it in half	sd	4
So youre going to have to watch closely of how I fold this because this gets a little tricky	How do you fold two thirds	sd	3
Bom ba da bom bom	Bom bom	sd	1
You have it in thirds	Yes	b	1
Classity class	Yessity yes	aa	1
Classity class	Yessity yes	aa	1
So how may pieces of the whole pizza did she eat	Two thirds	sd	4
I dont know what happened to this half	I dont even know if thats even a part of the pizza	sd	1
I dont even know if thats even a part of the pizza	Some random guy came and stole her pizza	sd	1
Classity class	Yessity yes	aa	1
Bom ba da bom bom	Bom bom	sd	1
Lets say Nolan Nolan has one third of a	Pepperoni	sd	1
You are folding your paper but thats not what youre doing right now	What am I doing right now	sd	3
Bom ba da bom bom	Bom bom	sd	1
So you should have one third times one half equals what	One sixth	sd	4
Just the directions and then Ill have someone read A Leah	What is three quarters of one third	sd	1
Fold that half in half	How many halves do want us to do	sd	3
Bom ba da bom bom	Bom bom	sd	1
Now we need to fold it into what	Thirds	sd	4
Classity class	Yessity yes	aa	1
So how many squares do we have in all	We have 12	sd	4
This was the last one were folding for today	Are you sure about that	qy	1
I am sure	Thank you	aa	1
Because we will be drawing lines for the rest of the day	Oh we are	sd	1
So Ive done fourths now I need to do	Thirds	sd	4
So we would have our one fourth colored in still but instead of	Instead of one being colored in	sd	4
We have three	Oh okay	b	1
Dakota can you start at the top and read out loud	Yes	b	1
Yes	The US Department of agriculture	sd	1
agriculture	agriculture conducts surveys to find out how much how out how much food Americans eat	sd	1
agriculture conducts surveys to find out how much how out how much food Americans eat	Average they asked a large number of people to keep lists of all their food I ate over a period of seven several days	sd	1
Average they asked a large number of people to keep lists of all their food I ate over a period of seven several days	These lists these lists are then used to estimate how much of each food they add in during the year Americans eat an average of 2000 pounds per food year food per year that this is about five halfs five and a half	sd	1
These lists these lists are then used to estimate how much of each food they add in during the year Americans eat an average of 2000 pounds per food year food per year that this is about five halfs five and a half	Five and a half pounds of food per year	sd	1
Five and a half pounds of food per year	The the most current results show that Americans eat or drink about following average amount of food foods in one year	sd	1
Does any of this information surprise anybody	It surprises me	sd	1
Can you explain more about that Kaylee	It surprises me because we have like a lot of food in his house	sd	5
It surprises me because we have like a lot of food in his house	But I didnt know that like other people went through that much food	sd	5
Kole What do you think	i agree with Kaylee	sd	2
Kole	I agree with Camille	sd	2
Can you tell me why	Because like how do you eat that much per day or per year	sd	1
Anybody else	It surprises me	sd	4
Why does it surprise you Dakota	Because we because most every day I eat three meals and three meals I feel is like a good amount	sd	5
Because we because most every day I eat three meals and three meals I feel is like a good amount	But 2000 pounds seems like a lot to me	sd	5
But 2000 pounds seems like a lot to me	And its just like Did I really eat that much food	sd	1
Do you think that every year people eat 2000 pounds of food per year	No	b	1
No	I think that it changes	sv	4
I see you in the chat	I think they can change because if they see this they can be like Oh Im eating too much	sd	5
I think they can change because if they see this they can be like Oh Im eating too much	I need to eat less and then theyll eat less	sd	5
What do you think	I think that it changes because for adults	sd	5
I think that it changes because for adults	since were kids our bellies arent that big	sd	5
since were kids our bellies arent that big	How adults are	sd	5
How adults are	Theyre Bigger	sd	5
Okay so are you saying Paige that adults eat more than children	I think so	sv	1
Okay does anyone agree with Paige	I disagree	sd	2
I disagree	I agree	aa	2
Miriam can you explain why you agree	Because my brother eats more than me now and my parents so I agree	sd	5
Um Lia you said you disagree	I disagree because since were growing children I think that we eat more than adults do on a daily average basic but it feels like when adults are eating more than then what we eat just because were actually getting more protein and nutrition because we just who still growing children	sd	5
Dakota what do you think	I feel like Im average the word average means like like if like like they like the average is like when like the normal person likes eats food or something	sd	4
So does it mean that every single American every single person that lives in this country eats two and a half pounds of food per day	No	b	1
No	the average that means like it can like keeping up my average	sd	4
the average that means like it can like keeping up my average	What did you say	sd	1
What did you say	Two and a half pounds or 2000 pounds	sd	3
I said five and a half pounds per day	I dont think so	sd	1
Do you think that you and everyone in your family or everyone in your community everybody in our school everybody in our class Do you think that everybody eats five and a half pounds per day	No	b	1
No	no	b	2
no	Maybe maybe not	sd	1
Why do you say no	I say no because like sometimes like if theyre sick maybe they dont want to eat so much food	sd	5
I say no because like sometimes like if theyre sick maybe they dont want to eat so much food	And like if theyre just not feeling like eating they dont eat	sd	5
Alright Paige	The most current results show show that America  eats or drinks about the following averages amounts of these foods in one year	sd	1
Now what mathematical equation would we use To find out how many pounds of bananas the students in our class would eat	I think I know	sv	1
Tell me	25 times 25 equals	sd	4
How would we do that	I think I know	sv	1
Haven how would you round 25	I would look at the ones place and then see see if its bigger than four	sd	5
I would look at the ones place and then see see if its bigger than four	And if its bigger for the I round it up to 30	sd	5
Mason do you agree	I disagree	aa	2
Mason tell me why you disagree	Because if we do what we can just do 25 plus another 25 will equal 50	sd	5
Because if we do what we can just do 25 plus another 25 will equal 50	But we still need 24 more of them	sd	5
But we still need 24 more of them	So equal bit more than what she said	sd	5
Four or less just ignore five or more	add one more	sd	4
Okay now I dont really want to around the kids in our class because if I say that we have about 30 kids in our class is that accurate	No	b	1
Is this a little bit easier to solve than 25 times 25	Yes	aa	1
Yes	yes	b	2
Can you give me a strategy of how Im going to solve 30 times 25	the way To solve it by separating it like that like three times two equals six	sd	5
Evie can I do that	yes	b	1
Can I do that	Yes you can Because thats the problem	sv	5
Yes you can Because thats the problem	30 times 25 so three times two equals six and zero times five equals zero	sd	5
hey what does someone else think	Wait no I think I think 6	sv	4
Haven why can we not do that	we cannot do that because we have to do 30 times 25	sd	5
So Haven how would you solve 30 times 25	I will start with 30	sd	4
I will start with 30	And keep on doing that	sd	4
And keep on doing that	I start with 30	sd	4
I start with 30	And do it 25 times	sd	4
If anyone thinks that they have a faster way I want you to speak up	I do	sd	1
Mason you think you have a faster way than me writing 30 25 times	Yes	b	1
Because I would like to save my energy	We can do three times two which will equal six and do zero times five which will just equal five so we can just add them to numbers	sd	5
Does my answer of 60 makes sense	No	aa	1
No	it really doesnt	sd	4
So who has another way that I could try this	I have another way	sd	1
And then lets go to Dakota	Okay so I thought of another way	sd	1
Okay so I thought of another way	Like you could like count your zeros first	sv	5
Like you could like count your zeros first	And then you could do 30 times five and then 30 times two	sd	5
So what sounds like to me Camille is that youre breaking up your your 25	Yeah	b	1
what are you breaking up your 25 into	20 and five and then you could go over 30 20 times and then go over five with 3 30 time with ya 30 20 times and then five times	sd	5
30 times 20 and 30 times five	Yes	b	1
Yes	Because you have to count your zeros	sv	5
Because you have to count your zeros	Which you have two zeros	sd	5
Which you have two zeros	And then you need to count your your and then you do times two times three which will get you six so your answer would be 600	sd	5
And then you need to count your your and then you do times two times three which will get you six so your answer would be 600	And then for the second one 30 times five you have to capture zero to equal 150 because three times five equals 15	sd	5
And then for the second one 30 times five you have to capture zero to equal 150 because three times five equals 15	Now all you need to do is add them up and then that will be a final answer	sd	5
All right so adding those up who can help me out what would 600 times 150 be	150	b	4
150	wait you said	sd	1
Itll be what		b	4
How many eggs does the average American eat a year		b	4
So how many about how many eggs would the family have four each year	I just did the math and I think I have an answer	sd	1
Dean what do you need buddy	I was going to say that isnt pizza Italian	sd	1
Is that related to what were talking about right now	No	b	1
Now which of these two numbers makes more sense to estimate to make it into an easier number to work with	Would it be 249 turning into 250	sd	4
Forrest	She rounded	sd	2
She rounded	Um to the nearest 10 Because the nine is more than five	sd	5
Do you think that he did what you did	Yeah he did	b	2
is 250 times four a little bit easier to figure out	I think so Because its like a number with a zero at the end	sd	5
Can you tell me more about that	Um 250 has a zero at the end	sd	4
Um 250 has a zero at the end	And I feel like that would be easier to work with	sd	4
Do you guys think I can use my zero role to solve this problem	Yeah	b	1
Oh there you are	You take away inaudibleand put on your answer	sd	4
Then what Evie	Count by five four times	sd	4
Does anybody know a piece of money that equals 25	I do	sd	1
I do	four quarters equals 1 so thats 100 pennies Each	sd	5
four quarters equals 1 so thats 100 pennies Each	Four times is 100	sd	5
So four of them equals 1 and 1 is equal to how many cents		b	4
		b	2
So what is 250 times four		b	4
Crosstalk	You need to attract one to get your answer for the	sd	4
Well what would I need to Subtract from this to get 249 might times four	You need to subract four	sd	2
Yes I need to subtract four	Which would equal 9996 or 996	sd	4
Give me a green checkmark when you have your numbers out in front of you	Can I take a guess what were gonna do with the numbers	sd	1
Sure	I think that we are going to times number by one	sd	5
I think that we are going to times number by one	So we know how and then well divide them into pounds	sd	5
So we know how and then well divide them into pounds	So we know how many pounds we ate or drink the last seven days a week	sd	5
Fatima Whats up	I put zero for eggs because Im allergic to eggs	sd	1
Does anybody know how many weeks there are in a year	I know that there are 360 days in a year	sd	4
I know that there are 360 days in a year	is this 70 weeks a year	sd	2
is this 70 weeks a year	Because 4 divided by 12 or 12 divided by four	sd	5
So in 100 weeks how many pieces of candy is T going to eat		b	4
		b	2
How many eggs Am I going to eat in two years	Zero	sd	4
All right how many cups of milk		b	4
		b	2
And Im going to call on some sticks for people to share	Ms Cornish Can I add all my numbers up	sd	1
After youre done solving all three of those	Im already done	sd	1
Okay Im gonna give you about 30 more seconds	inauidble  you see me at lunch Im probably gonna have a big giant salad on a nice plate	sd	1
inauidble  you see me at lunch Im probably gonna have a big giant salad on a nice plate	Oh when I multiplied my milk I guess Im gonna drink a lot of Milk	sd	1
How many cups of milk Are you going to drink in two years	Its not technically cups	sd	4
Its not technically cups	Its gallons	sd	4
How many gallons of milk Are you going to drink in two years		b	4
Charlie do you drink a lot of milk every week	Yeah	b	1
So try not to share zero try to share a number which one of these how many pieces of candy milk or eggs are you going to eat in a year	I would eat 7000 pieces of candy Because	sd	4
Over 2 years	Which one	aa	3
Which one	Which one is the two years of candy because I am confused	sd	3
times 100 is two years because you eat I seven pieces of candy a week and theres 100 weeks in two years	So I would 700 pieces of candy over the span of two years	sd	4
two what	Are we looking at the answer	sd	1
Sure are yup	Okay let me	sd	1
two glasses of milk or two pieces of candy	I ate two pieces I just ste Oh I eat in a week	sd	1
I ate two pieces I just ste Oh I eat in a week	I usually eat like about five eggs because I like eggs	sd	1
Okay	I drink like six glasses like maybe seven glasses of milk	sd	1
I drink like six glasses like maybe seven glasses of milk	And I usually only eat like three pieces of candy	sd	1
And I usually only eat like three pieces of candy	So now	sd	1
all right Hunter	cuz Im pretty healthy	sd	1
Hunter Im still talking to you buddy		b	4
500 Hunter Did you know that you could eat 500 eggs	Um no I did not	sd	1
Kelly please unmute and talk to us	Okay	b	1
Can you tell us	Im not sure	sd	3
Eggs milk or candy	Eggs	sd	1
How many eggs do you eat	5	b	1
What am I gonna multiply by		b	4
So let me just get math up really quickly	Hi	b	1
Hi	Here	sd	1
All right now we are continuing with our learning of multidigit multiplication okay	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I like it a lot	sd	1
I like it a lot	I love it	sd	1
Answer one and then keep it written	Easy got one	sd	1
Connor	What was that for again	sd	1
You need to have your whiteboard out	Oh whiteboard	sd	1
Oh whiteboard	Okay	b	1
All right	Show me your board	sd	1
Show me your board	I did not get that yet	sd	1
Thats a limited supply for the whole year especially if youve already had one or two	Would you like my	sd	1
Would you like my	I have one	sd	1
Look at the next one please	Were supposed to  jacks	sd	1
Damien	So we keep our answers from the other time	sd	1
Yes leave them on there	All right	aa	1
1 2 3 show me your boards		b	4
	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So do we keep our answers on our boards	sd	1
You dont want to do that	Thats why its special	sv	1
But  making noises	I just smacked my elbow	sd	1
1 2 3 show me your boards		b	4
All right	Can we still keep our boards	sd	1
You can erase the board now	Ill keep that	sd	1
Charlie	I just realized that its like a pattern because it all has an 8 in it	sd	4
This is one of those quick facts we should know right away	I get this on my math test	sd	1
I get this on my math test	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We all do	sd	1
We all do	Thats something handy to do	sv	1
Awesome	Do you want us to keep this one our board too	sd	1
Yes that will help you	I need the	sd	1
So it is 30 because 10 to the first power is just 10	30	b	1
9 x 10 to the first power hopefully if you miss that last one that will help you on this one	We all know this	sd	1
And last but not least	What	ba	1
What	Oh my	ba	1
Oh my	use your brain a little bit	sd	1
use your brain a little bit	No its not	sd	1
Sh	Were just	sd	1
Antonella can you tell me how you got that answer	In the corner I wrote down 3 x 9 and I wrote in the corner	sd	4
Okay	So if I threw in zeros it would be 27 and then plus a 2 and then 3 you put a comma	sd	5
Camille	How come that was 2 zeros and 1 zero	sd	3
So would do the 3 x 9 is 27	Is this open reader	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
On to the math message	Is that actually true	sd	1
Yes	Oh so 18	sd	4
I want you to work on this silently and then were going to share our strategies okay	Yes	b	1
You need to be solving this problem	Sorry	b	1
The bigger number goes on top	Oh right	b	1
Oh right		b	4
	Six	sd	4
Be careful with the you make the numbers look like something else	Oh	aa	1
Are you ready to share how you get that	Yup	aa	1
Im going to have you share with partners	Im just	sd	1
	Ow	b	1
Oh I see	Whoa	sd	1
I want you to have a conversation with your partner	I got 646	sd	4
I got 646	Can you explain	sd	3
Can you explain	I got three thousand	sd	5
I got three thousand	times 3	sd	5
times 3	8 x 6	sd	5
8 x 6	I put 8	sd	5
So	Thats a 10	sv	4
Thats a 10	Mines doesnt make sense	sd	4
Mines doesnt make sense	Yours makes more sense	sd	2
Yours makes more sense	Im going to really explain	sd	1
Im going to really explain	That doesnt work	sd	4
That doesnt work	Im going to really explain	sd	1
Can you explain that	Okay well I did American traditional	sd	5
Okay well I did American traditional	I did 8 x 5 which goes 40 and I did 8 x 6 which equals 47 but I had to add the 4 and I put	sd	5
Are you still listening to Lennox	My final answer is 2970 and the final  is 3 thousand  so I add those together and I got 6970	sd	5
Show me your board	Yeah youre in	aa	1
Yeah youre in	Dustin get this	sd	1
Dustin get this	Get this so what answers	sd	1
That place hold a zero right	I think back on it	sv	1
I think back on it	I got it right	sd	1
I got it right	I switched it	sd	1
I see	What answer did you get	ba	3
What answer did you get	Shes answering	sd	1
Shes answering	Sure	b	1
Youre close to being there	I just had 21	sd	4
I just had 21	Do you want to see my answer	sd	1
Youre close to being there	You did not say 21 Fernando	sd	2
You did not say 21 Fernando	What	ba	1
What	I did not	sd	1
I did not	Theres not 21	sd	4
Gavin	What	ba	1
What	What	ba	1
Its not funny	What do you mean its not funny	sv	1
	I didnt say anything	sd	1
Not funny	I didnt	sd	1
Now Celeste would you like to share your thinking please	Sure	b	1
Sure	I did US traditional	sd	4
Okay	When we do the traditional I multiplied it	sd	5
When we do the traditional I multiplied it	I put the numbers down and carried them	sd	5
So you wrote it and then multiplied it	Yes	b	1
Okay Charlie how did you do it	Im looking at Celestes board and it looks a little different than mine because I just did 365 x 18 then I just went down and down and down and I got 840	sd	5
Lonnie	I was going to ask if could share how I did it	sd	1
Of course	Right now	b	1
Yes	I thought Celeste was going	sd	1
Celeste went then Charlie went and now youre going	Okay	b	1
Okay	I did 5 x 8 40 carry the 4 and then I did 8 x 6 is 48	sd	5
So then you did 8 x 6 is 48 okay	So then I dropped the 8 and then I put the 4 into the 3	sd	5
I bet you did something different	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Youre missing one	aa	2
Youre missing one	Youre missing one	aa	2
Madison whats he missing	The 4 from the	sd	4
If 8 x 6 is 48 you have to add on this 4	Okay never mind I did 52	sd	4
Yes	And then I put	sd	1
And then I put	Okay never mind	sd	1
Okay never mind	I was thinking something different but thats what I did	sd	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	And then I did 8 x 3 is 24 plus the five is 290	sd	5
I noticed a lot of people and were actually going to go stepbystep through this again	I think by mistake I did	sd	4
So that was us going there	And then you have to do the one	sd	4
1 x 365 is 365	No wrong	sd	4
Why is it wrong	You forgot the zero	sd	4
Collete	Its not	sd	4
Its not	When youre doing that method before you go down you always have to place the zero and then multiply	sd	3
What am I multiplying by		b	4
So that place holder is zero is making that a 10 then we go 365 and then we add	Yes	b	1
Yes	I got it right	sd	1
I got it right	I dont think I added	sd	4
I dont think I added	Yes	b	1
Yes	I got it right	sd	1
Camille	So when we were doing it  can we think of this to go up there	sd	4
Say that again for me	Is the  supposed to go up	sd	4
Is that what youre asking	Yes because I really dont get the answer	sd	3
No its not twohundredandninetytwozero its 2920	And are you doing the traditional method	sd	4
Yes	Oh	b	1
Have you guys ever heard of an algorithm before	Yeah	b	1
An algorithm	What the heck	sd	1
It is a	Stepbystep way to do something	sd	4
set of steps	Yes	b	1
So even if you feel comfortable with it	S	b	1
Im going to solve this like that	S	b	1
So here I have Step 1	Step 1	sd	1
Step 1	Step 1	sd	1
Step 1	Step 1	sd	1
Come on boardy	We went backwards	sd	1
We sure did didnt we	Yeah maybe	b	1
Yeah maybe	No no no	sd	1
You know what	Thats from the other day	sd	1
Thats from the other day	No	b	1
So Step 1 we multiply thats for two seconds long fast	Oh	b	1
Long fast	Me	sd	1
Sit down	What	ba	1
Write this problem on your board and solve this Step 1	Okay	b	1
Sh	Do we just multiply 306 x 3	sd	4
You cant use that on your boards	I know	aa	1
I know	I tried writing it and	sd	1
Celeste	I have a question from once we all finish stuff like that	sd	1
I have a question from once we all finish stuff like that	Can we do the board	sd	1
Yes only do this first step right here	Okay	b	1
Celeste	So when youre multiplying  zero that becomes zero and then you have to add one so would you still put down the 1	sd	5
Whats 0  1		b	4
And then 3 x 5 is		b	4
Does that answer your question	Yes	b	1
Oh my gosh	Can you erase	sd	1
No please do not erase what you just did	Okay	b	1
Everybody		b	4
It is worth		b	4
Awesome	Youre welcome	sd	1
Youre welcome	There should be another kit  right now	sd	1
You guys are great	What are those	sd	1
What are those	science	aa	1
science	Science	aa	1
So take one more minute to solve	Oh shoot	sd	1
Im waiting	Can you solve this	sd	1
Discuss it with your partner	I knew this was going to be a zero so I	sd	4
I knew this was going to be a zero so I	Some answers	sd	1
Some answers	I got a zero	sd	4
I got a zero	Yes	b	2
Yes	Multiply	sd	4
Multiply	Courtney	sd	1
Courtney	I almost forgot the zero so I put the zero down first and I got 4 x 6  24 so I wrote 4 and I put the two on top and 4 x 0  0 and you have to add the 2 which counts the 2 and 4	sd	5
I almost forgot the zero so I put the zero down first and I got 4 x 6  24 so I wrote 4 and I put the two on top and 4 x 0  0 and you have to add the 2 which counts the 2 and 4	And I got 20 thousand	sd	5
Just keep it as part of the same problem okay	I didnt know it was US	sd	4
All right	Okay good	b	1
Who would like to share their thinking here	Oh shoot	sd	1
Oh shoot	I totally messed up	sd	4
Camille	I	b	1
506 x 4	I know I got it wrong	sd	4
All right		b	4
So Im going to put the 4 here	And the 2	sd	4
and the 2 here	Okay okay I see	b	1
Okay okay I see		b	4
What is 0  2		b	4
	Can I have that	sd	1
Can I have that		b	4
		b	2
It seems like Did I do something wrong	No	b	1
No	No you didnt do anything wrong	sd	4
Im just wondering because a lot of people are reacting as if I had done something wrong	No you did your perfect math and its good	sv	4
Okay any questions about that stuff	I dont get How did you get the 4	sd	3
The 4	Because how I got it I got the 8 because the 4 is 0 is 0 but then you have that 2 up there from the 24 then you go times 2	sd	5
So our first step Derek is to do 4 x 6	Really	aa	1
4 x 6 is 24 so thats why the 4 goes here and the 2 goes up here	I meant the	sd	1
Here	No the 4 x the 2	sd	4
So watch		b	4
What is 0  2		b	4
Thats why the 2 goes there	Oh I was doing	sd	1
Youre having the 2 take the place of the 0	Like I was doing that before like 4 x 2 4 x 2	sd	4
And then we had 5 x 4	Oh	b	1
Which is 20	I do that sometimes	sd	1
I appreciate that	She goes to cheer	sd	1
She goes to cheer	No I won	sd	1
No I won	I was in cheer last year	sd	1
I was in cheer last year	She didnt cheer for two years	sd	1
She didnt cheer for two years	Being a cheerleader is	sd	1
Now end products everybody add please Step 3	The thousandth place is going to be Connors favorite	sd	1
The thousandth place is going to be Connors favorite	As soon as I looked at it I was like	sd	1
Sh	for a second	sd	1
Gavin	How did you get 20000	sd	3
4 x 6 is 24	Im hungry	sd	1
So whats 4 x 5	I made a mistake but	sd	4
Does that make sense	Oh you did 5 times	sd	4
Oh you did 5 times	Thats okay	ba	1
Oh my god stop	Yeah	b	1
Im just saying	I saw you doing this	sd	1
I saw you doing this	It doesnt help	sd	1
Celeste		b	4
Jeffery do you agree with Celeste	Nice	aa	2
Nice	Yes I do	sd	2
What did she get	I got it too	sd	2
I got it too	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So did Antonella	sd	2
So did Antonella	So did Lennox	sd	2
After lunch were going to work on threedigit	Yes	b	1
times threedigit	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Wow	aa	1
What I need from you right now	I love this	sd	1
put your journal your white board and your marker in one pile so its ready for you after lunch	I like it because it trains my brain	sd	1
What do you think this is a signal for	Youre ready	sd	1
Brandon my question says find the GCF for 21 and 15	Three	sd	4
Okay so you ask me your question	Find the GCF of 24 and 30	sd	1
Lets say that I make my division ladder and I say I think the GCF is 2	Thats a common factor but not the greatest common factor	sd	4
What was it 24 and 30	Yes	b	1
Then Im going to multiply 4 and 30 so 120	Is GCF	sd	4
2 times 3 times 1 is 6	Yes	b	1
We did Quiz Quiz what are we going to do now	Trade	sd	4
What do you say to me	See you later	qy	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Dan give me one thing you should remember	You should remember to tell your partner why they got it wrong if they got it wrong	sd	4
Joy	Give specific feedback but do it in a nice way so it doesnt hurt their feelings	sd	4
Thats wonderful	When they get it right always congratulate them	sd	4
Yes that feels so good	Never give away the answer	sd	4
Eliza	to understand if they get something wrong that you dont get to be mad	sd	4
Lyra last one	Ask them how if they wanted  coaching	sd	4
Ask them how if they wanted  coaching	Like if they want to try and figure it out on their own  coaching them	sd	4
Yes Charles	One thing that I think I did really well was finding the LCM and	sd	4
Okay can you think of something like as a group that we did well	I think just  in general	sd	1
Rob	When I couldnt figure out the problem Isaiah helped me a lot	sd	2
Lyra	I think	sv	1
I think	Jack was another good coach because when I got it right he was very  and it felt really nice	sd	2
Would you like to do Quiz Quiz Trade again in the future	Yes	b	1
So please complete the division problem	Do you want us to solve it in partial quotients or us traditional	sd	3
Okay Ben	I think I got I got it correct	sd	1
I think I got I got it correct	And how I got it correct is I did 833 times 700 which was which was seven times 100	sd	5
And how I got it correct is I did 833 times 700 which was which was seven times 100	And I got 133	sd	5
And I got 133	Then after that I found my multipliers I then I multiply then I had then I did seven times 10 which was 70	sd	5
Then after that I found my multipliers I then I multiply then I had then I did seven times 10 which was 70	And then I got 63	sd	5
And then I got 63	And then I did 63 times 63 was which I mean 63 subtracts from 63 and it was zero	sd	5
And then I did 63 times 63 was which I mean 63 subtracts from 63 and it was zero	Then I added this the side numbers	sd	5
Okay Mr Zach Im gonna come to you	So I did partial products and I got it correct	sd	4
So I did partial products and I got it correct	So I did the same thing Josh did	sd	2
So I did the same thing Josh did	I did seven times 100 is 700	sd	5
I did seven times 100 is 700	So i minus 700 from 833	sd	5
So i minus 700 from 833	And I got 133	sd	5
And I got 133	And then I did seven times 10 which is 70	sd	5
And then I did seven times 10 which is 70	And then that equals 63	sd	5
And then that equals 63	And then I knew that 63 was a multiple of seven	sd	5
And then I knew that 63 was a multiple of seven	So I just minus that and did 100 plus 10 plus nine to get 119	sd	5
or do you like both ways	Im fine with both of them	sd	1
Im fine with both of them	Yeah	b	1
Now if you got it wrong	I got it wrong by one	sd	4
Turn your camera on sweetie	Can you see me	sd	1
No I cannot	My camera is on	sd	1
And tell us where you made your mistake	Okay so I I got 120	sd	4
Okay so I I got 120	So what I did was I did it like so I did I found I knew that	sd	1
So what I did was I did it like so I did I found I knew that	Seven times one gets that close to eight	sd	5
Seven times one gets that close to eight	So I wrote seven right here	sd	5
So I wrote seven right here	And I minus it and I got and I got one	sd	5
And I minus it and I got and I got one	So then I added the three and I got 13	sd	5
So then I added the three and I got 13	So then I said then I figured out if seven times something equals 13	sd	5
So then I said then I figured out if seven times something equals 13	But I think Im at one over maybe	sd	5
But I think Im at one over maybe	So I did two instead of a one	sd	5
So I did two instead of a one	Cuz four	sd	5
Cuz four	I was doing it	sd	1
I was doing it	I did it two above so I put the two up there	sd	5
I did it two above so I put the two up there	And then I did I wrote fourteen two here and got zero	sd	5
And then I did I wrote fourteen two here and got zero	So I went up by one	sd	5
Because if I have 13 if I take away 14 I have a negative number dont I	Yeah	b	1
So yesterday our math message was let me go back to Im going to close that	Can we erase our boards	sd	1
May I use yours	Yes	b	1
Thats all Im doing right now and then	i submitted mine	sd	1
You need to make sure you do it	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Okay show me your whiteboard again buddy	Okay	b	1
Okay	Um its hard to see but I did six divided by 3 6 divided by two	sd	4
type them in the chat box	Sorry	b	1
I dont understand why this is being so awful right now	Its number five	sd	1
Kate Ill see if this is my number five	Because mine says five partial quotients with multiples	sd	1
Because mine says five partial quotients with multiples	And thats what this page is	sd	1
Let me try this one	Oh yeah its that one right there	sd	1
So Im going to recreate because I only want to have you in a room	You want us to use partial quotients or just us division	sd	3
Okay	miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes	you us to write it on our paper or our whiteboards	sd	1
Okay	inauidble chromebooks	sd	1
three minutes what	are doing it on our Chromebook or our Apple Mac Journals	sd	1
Mac journals and be able to explain it	Okay	b	1
Alright here we go	I like turtles	sd	1
Gage and Matt Why did you not join your groups	I did	sd	1
Well how come youre still with me	Nobody else showed and so I left	sd	1
So Gage honey Let me move you to another room so you can at least have a conversation	Okay	b	1
Okay John	inaudible we didnt get to finish	sd	1
Tell me about the process you started	Still working on it but Ill do it I guess	sd	1
Still working on it but Ill do it I guess	Um so what I think Id do well I havent even started the problem	sd	1
Um so what I think Id do well I havent even started the problem	Okay so	b	1
why have you not started the problem Adam	Because Im trying to figure out which number goes into 1647	sd	3
um Reese how did you guys do	Um I didnt have anybody in my group	sd	1
Did you finish it	No	b	1
Im gonna move you back into your group you were with	Emily	b	1
Remy go ahead	What I did was I used 15	sd	4
Why did you use 15 Remy	Because 15 times 28 Is 420	sd	5
All the way down	Yes	aa	1
Okay	long division took a long time for me	sd	1
Okay	Were doing 501 slides and test	sd	1
What did he start with	Three fourths	sd	4
And what did he eat	Half	sd	4
Go ahead	I dont really know but I think maybe say a sword instead of a magic wand maybe real world stuff I think	sd	4
Would you share a pizza	Yeah	b	2
Would you carpet a room	No	b	1
Would you buy cookies to share	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	2
Would you figure out how much paint youd need to cover a room	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Greater than leS than equal to	Greater than	sd	4
What happens when you multiply a number by one	What	ba	1
What happens when you multiply a number by one	Oh	b	1
Is it going to change	No	b	1
Three fourths times three is it greater than leS than or equal too three fourths	I said greater than	sd	4
How come	Because oh	sd	1
Go ahead and phone a friend please	I said equal to because three is a whole number so youre just making three fourths into more three fourths	sd	5
I said equal to because three is a whole number so youre just making three fourths into more three fourths	I dont know how to explain this	sd	3
What do you think	I think you do three fourths times three and so you do three times three because the three is the numerator and so it would be nine fourths	sd	5
so help explain where Michaels going who can add to that	Well you got the first part right but then you	sd	2
What part did he get right	The three times three	sd	2
The three times three	Yes but after that you had to do three times four because whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom	sd	5
Yes but after that you had to do three times four because whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom	And three times four is twelve	sd	5
And three times four is twelve	So it would be nine over twelve	sd	5
Do we agree with that or disagree	Agree	sd	2
Okay Gage can you explain the next one	I said equal to because anything times one is just what it was	sd	5
Do we agree with that	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Anything we multiply by one	Is the same number	sd	4
All right and now Im going to do Abby is not here James the last one is three fourths times one half great than leS than or equal too	I said leS than because three times one is three and	sd	5
So you said Im sorry did you say greater than leS than or equal too	LeS than	sd	4
Okay so three fourths times one half is leS than three fourths do we agree with that	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yeah	b	2
All righty my loves here we go on to the next thing	Already	b	1
Write at least three down on your whiteboard and then stand up	I dont know	sd	3
Anna do you normally work with Matt	No	b	1
Okay would you please go stand by Matt	Yes	b	1
Charlotte do you normally work with Adam	No	b	1
Ben do you normally work with James	Not really	sd	1
AlySa do you ever work with Ethan	Yeah	b	1
Okay so I have Julia do you normally work with Ethan	No	b	1
Do you ever work with Blake AlySa	No	b	1
Have you	No	b	1
Davis do you normally work with Michael	Not really	sd	1
Do you normally work with Connor	No	b	1
Do you normally work with Zach	No	b	1
Okay how about you and Gage	Yeah we do too	sd	1
Do you normally work together	Oh theyre friends	sd	1
Oh theyre friends	Yeah they work together more	sd	1
And Austin Im going to have you join Davis and Michael	Oh	b	1
Oh	Okay	b	1
Okay you have three minutes that gives each person in the group time to speak so three minutes and go	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I said that	sd	1
Okay when your group is done please return to your seat thank your partner and go	Thank you	aa	1
Go	We talked about when you redo your floors or carpets and you have to figure out what the area of the ground there is so that it fits	sd	4
What did you guys say	What we talked about was say youre doing your homework and you maybe need to use multiplication division and yeah	sd	4
Excellent job	What we talked about was when you buy two or more things at the store when you buy multiple things you can just times it by two or how many youre getting	sd	4
So	Thats what I said	sd	1
MiS Isaac you are up	No thats Ben	ba	1
My brain is	When youre doing homework and youll have to do multiplication	sd	4
Well thats pretty easy I know I have one miSing and I should be able to do equal groups of two	But we	sd	1
Volume and comparing amount of measurements so if a child is three feet tall and her father is two times taller her fathers what	Six foot	sd	4
Exactly	Six feet is	sd	1
Okay	No its not because	sd	1
So now	Shes pretty short	sd	1
Shes pretty short	Shes that tall	sd	1
Shes that tall	Shes this tall	sd	1
Shes this tall	The size of my foot is	sd	1
Okay so we talked about all of the ways we would solve	Thats like eight feet then	sd	1
Oh I know what I need to do I would like you and your partner are we ready	Yes maam	sd	1
Yes maam	Yes	b	1
It has to equal one of those	Or can we use seven eight and To make 56 because seven times eight	sd	5
Everyone should be participating	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay so what I think we can write I thought we could do	sd	1
Okay go ahead	So if you were at a supermarket	sd	4
Talk it out before you write it	Say if you were in a supermarket and you bought  Bananas cost up to like  and each banana  Seven times eight equals 56	sd	5
Say if you were in a supermarket and you bought  Bananas cost up to like  and each banana  Seven times eight equals 56	Eight by seven	sd	2
Eight by seven	How do you spell	qy	1
Thats okay	So he scored seven points	sd	4
So he scored seven points	Equals 56	sd	4
Thank you	Oh thats so easy to read read it	sd	1
Oh thats so easy to read read it	What how	sd	1
What how	Look watch	sd	1
Look watch	Im getting my bs and ds mixed up again	sd	1
When your group is done please have a seat on the ground wherever youre at just have a seat	Sit on the ground not on a chair	sd	1
Connor Connor Connor Connor	Do we stay with our partners or go back	sd	1
Go to a zero	We said in the food drive someone drops off seven boxes of cans and theres eight cans in each box	sd	4
We said in the food drive someone drops off seven boxes of cans and theres eight cans in each box	How many cans in total	sd	4
Number story	Yes	b	2
Connor tell me why	Why thats a number story is because theres seven cans no theres seven boxes and then theres eight cans in each one	sd	5
Why thats a number story is because theres seven cans no theres seven boxes and then theres eight cans in each one	So if you count it all it does equal 56	sd	5
Okay Ben and James please read yours	Okay	b	1
The way it is written gentlemen	What we said was John went to the store and bought seven bananas and each banana cost 8 then he went to the checkout and got a grand total of 56	sd	5
Okay is that a number story yes or no	No	b	2
Do you need to ask for help in your group	Yeah	b	1
Go ahead	We said John went golfing and he scored seven points on eight holes	sd	4
We said John went golfing and he scored seven points on eight holes	How many points did he get	sd	4
Like that means he didnt even have to get a point on one	Yeah he didnt	sd	4
Okay Im going to come right back here	I said Jimmy Jonathon has seven feet of fence one way and eight on the other how much area of fencing does he have in total	sd	4
Do we agree that he used the correct vocabulary	No	b	2
John why are you saying no	Because he didnt use area	sd	5
Because he didnt use area	I said how much area of fencing does he have in total	sd	2
I said how much area of fencing does he have in total	Hey Matt can you read the question	sd	2
Read the question again Matt	Jimmy Jonathon feet of fencing one way and eight feet the other way how much area of fencing does he have in total	sd	4
Go ahead	You shouldve said instead of one way and another way you shouldve said width and length	sd	2
Length and width okay	Yes	b	2
Go ahead youre up	Okay we said our room is eight feet long eight by one and the carpet we want is two feet long and four times two equals eight so we need to get four pieces to cover it	sd	4
Okay do they have a number story yes or no	No	b	2
Why not Austin	Because they gave the answer	sd	5
They gave the answer	And they didnt use a question	sd	2
Matt did you want to add to it	She said we she didnt give a specific person in her number story but I think thats okay	sd	4
Go ahead Dan and Emily	Okay	b	1
Please tell me you didnt change something because you heard other people	No	b	1
Okay because I want exactly what you wrote	So I said we said	sd	1
We said	and Emma are going around the town to sell cookies	sd	5
and Emma are going around the town to sell cookies	They have 100 cookies and they need to have 56 left over	sd	5
They have 100 cookies and they need to have 56 left over	And then we said to get 56 cookies they need to sell 44 cookies	sd	5
First of all Im going to ask is that a multiplication story problem	No	b	2
No what type of problem is it everyone	Subtraction	aa	2
Okay	We added	sd	4
We added	No because you did 56	sd	5
No because you did 56	Oh wait no	sd	2
And was there a question in there	No	b	2
Go ahead next up	So we wrote one day I was fitting new carpet in my bedroom the length was seven feet and the width was eight feet	sd	4
So we wrote one day I was fitting new carpet in my bedroom the length was seven feet and the width was eight feet	I know I had to multiply the length by the width to find out how much carpet we need today	sd	4
I know I had to multiply the length by the width to find out how much carpet we need today	How much carpet do we need	sd	4
How much carpet do we need	Oh that was great	sd	2
And it had the proper mathematical	Equation	aa	4
Okay over here	So we are getting a carpet and we need eight feet for our length and seven feet for our width and then we have to multiply eight by seven so how much feet of carpet do we need	sd	4
How much feet of carpet do we need		b	4
We agree	Yeah	b	2
Is it how much feet of carpet do I need or how many feet of carpet do I need	How many feet	sd	4
How much does something cost how many of it do I need	Oh	b	1
Oh	Yeah	b	1
Go ahead	Okay	b	1
Okay	has seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have	sd	4
Seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have all together everybody		b	4
Here we go	Lets go	sd	1
When your group is done stand up	its six because three times three is nine	sd	5
its six because three times three is nine	Or is it 12	sd	2
Or is it 12	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Because nine divided by three is three and then three times two is six	sd	5
I want you to be able after you solve it to answer all of these questions	Thats a lot of questions	sd	1
Thats a lot of questions		b	4
Gentlemen you have to able to answer all those questions so stay seated until youve got them done	Can we move up	sd	1
Can we move up	We cant see them	sd	1
You may move right here	Bro theres too much questions though	sd	1
Bro theres too much questions though	Two thirds	sd	4
You know how to solve these	Nine divided by	sd	1
Okay	So what mathematical	sd	1
Well you have the number model so what operation did you use	Oh	b	1
Are we working on division or multiplication in order to be able to meet our succeS criterions	because two times two is six	sd	5
Your learning objective is to multiply	Because six will technically be our equivalent because three times two is six	sd	5
Thats what its asking is greater than leS than or equal too	Okay so	aa	1
Okay so	Yes itll be equal to each other yes	sd	4
Yes itll be equal to each other yes	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Itll be equal	sd	2
Itll be equal	It wouldnt be equal because six	sd	5
It wouldnt be equal because six	Two thirds is smaller	sd	2
Okay buddy go ahead	First you put nine times  and then we divided it by three and then we got three	sd	5
First you put nine times  and then we divided it by three and then we got three	And then you get three times two equals six	sd	5
Okay but did you answer the questions of is it greater than leS than did you do any of those	Yes	b	1
Yes	Greater than	sd	4
And then yes it is greater than two thirds	Yeah	b	1
Go ahead Ben	Okay so	aa	1
Okay so	We knew it would be bigger than nine because two times three which is six and three times three is nine	sd	5
We knew it would be bigger than nine because two times three which is six and three times three is nine	So then he spent 6 on comics so it will be equal to the two thirds because it is a total to six ninths and it would be leS than nine because youre multiplying by two thirds	sd	5
Why did you do that	Because	sd	1
Because	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	I see what youre saying	sd	1
Because you are absolutely right but Im asking you to explain this part of your conceptual understanding of it	Because I knew that it was supposed to be equal to nine two thirds if nine is	sd	5
You are doing a great job	And then I knew that two times three was six and	sd	5
Kate can you add to that	I wrote it a little bit different I did	sd	2
And Ben you are exactly correct I needed to check on a couple of things	So I wrote here I did one third times nine because its 9 to get three and then six is two thirds of nine then I did the two thirds times nine and the three times two is six	sd	5
What made you do that	Because I just find it easier first to figure it out without the two thirds so I just made it one third and then multiply it by two	sd	5
What did you get out of what they just said	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Because	sd	1
Does Adams way of doing this work	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yeah	b	2
Does Austins way of doing it work	Yup	aa	2
Yup	Yeah	b	2
Yes man	Do we write the number sentence on the whiteboard or on the piece of paper	sd	1
The number sentences are right here	Like the number story	sd	1
We have 30 minutes if you finish I am going to ask you to show me you are finished by separating from your partner and going back to work on math	Do you have an extra pair of sciSors	sd	1
Do you have an extra pair of sciSors	Because I dont have any sciSors	sd	1
Oh sweetheart let me get you a cup okay	Maam I dont have sciSors	sd	1
Does every group have paper	No	b	1
Okay		b	1
Connor that is not appropriate use of Do you need sciSors	Yes	b	1
Anyone else need sciSors	Were sharing	sd	1
You are sharing	Yes theres literally two right here	sd	1
I love that about you Isaac	What	ba	1

Good	Good	ba	1
So are you going to write a story problem about that one	Maybe	sd	1
You havent decided yet	My finger is literally turning purple	sd	1
Yup someone else needs to solve	And that its two thirds and four fifths	sd	4
And that its two thirds and four fifths	Four times  Thats the ones we count	sd	4
How do you know that	Three fourths colored in on all of these and there is 10 squares and there is three colored in and so three times 10 equals	sd	4
Everybody needs to explain it not just one person in the group	30	b	4
Remember yesterday I was freezing all day	Yeah	b	1
So do you know maybe who you are going to go meet on Saturday	I was at grandma	sd	1
And you know what	What	ba	1

Yeah	Okay	b	1
Thats all this is about okay	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Hey friends do you need me	No	b	1
No	Yeah	b	1
Well yeah you have to find the number problem that goes with the picture the representation card	All right so we just got to use one	sd	4
All right so we just got to use one	Here it is	sd	2
And whats two times two	Okay that makes more sense	sd	1
James the strategy I have for you is two I wish I was as good as all of you that come up with different strategies Im not that good	and this one	sd	1
and this one	We have to write about	sd	1
We have to write about	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No lets use that one	sd	1
No lets use that one	One and seven	sd	4
Okay	G and H	sd	4
G and H	So theres two fifths and then theres still the two	sd	4
One two three four the one fifth is left so	Its because theres eight two fifths	sd	5
Okay	Yeah I see now	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Okay get here too	That was the number A	sd	4
Very good youre good now pick your two	So do we do that	sd	1
Do it together	And then wheres our partner working	sd	1
Youre both doing them together	I never do anything alone	sd	1
Youre not gluing them in there	Yeah I know	sd	1
Five eighths that is right	We dont know if its just confusing	sd	3
What is confusing	The five eighths	sd	3
Someone else might and then if not well discuS how we would do it	What do you think the number story	sv	1
Dizzy John	No its wet	sd	1

We split an apple pie into thirds	And then	sd	1
Ill pick it up	Okay so then we ate six pieces of apple pie	sd	4
Okay so then we ate six pieces of apple pie	If its cut into thirds how do you eat six	sv	3
If its cut into thirds how do you eat six	You dont have three pieces	sd	2
You dont have three pieces	Because three times two is six	sd	5
Because three times two is six	Three times six is 18	sd	5

Yes you did	No I didnt	sd	1
No I didnt	You guys stop talking	sd	1
Do you remember doing that	Yes	b	1
Ari	38	b	4
38 and how did we know it was 38	We knew that it was 38 because  since  four and eight it would have to  four by two and that would be eight and that  same thing to the numerators	sd	5
28 plus 18 is	Three	sd	4
Three	You dont remember this	sd	1
You dont remember this	No	b	1
If youre talking that means you need help so please raise your hand if you need help	Is this dark blue	sd	1
Is this dark blue	Thats purple	sv	1
12 plus 14 using your fraction circle pieces	12	b	1
What did you do first Ari	I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	sd	5
I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	So	b	1
We did cross off the 12	Thats what I was going to say	sd	2
James say it again	I already knew 12 was 24 and 24 is equals 12 and then I knew 24 was	sd	5
The next step is 24 plus 14 equals what was our answer	34	b	4
Green	I think its light green	sd	4
I think its light green	Wait I think its the purple right	sv	2
Wait I think its the purple right	Okay purple it is	sd	2
All right does that make sense now	Yes	b	1
Haley does that makes sense	Yes	b	1
Dont say yes if you dont If youre lying to me dont lie and say yes	I get it	sd	1
Avery can you explain how you got your answer to this one	Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	sd	1
Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	sd	5
What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	Then thats as far as I got	sd	1
Okay then the light green might not be the right one	Its purple	sd	4
Did that work with purple	Yes	b	1
Hunter can you explain your thinking for this one please	I know 12 is 48 and then I did four plus three is seven so I got 78	sd	5
Say that again	I knew 12 is 48 so I did 48 plus 38 and I got 78	sd	5
You see the difference there	Yes	b	1
Sean why do we estimate	We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct	sd	5
Have you been using them	Yes	b	1
Mark do you have your answer	Yes	b	1
I like seeing youre thinking	I dont get it	sd	3
How is this problem different from other problems we did	Because 13 and then 12	sd	5
Ari	Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	sd	5
Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that	sd	5
What do you think about that Matthew	I think that you just have to find a way that both  another fraction that fits into both of them	sv	4
Can you say that again a little louder	You have to find a fraction thats fits evenly in a 12	sd	4
Laura can you repeat what she said	You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13	sd	2
Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Morgan share your thinking for me please	Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then	sd	4
Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange	Yes	b	1
Okay	Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	sd	5
Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	Then I used the purple pieces to see that it would be like 612 on each side so then I would take away the two that I used to find that and then it would be 1012 but then you can also convert that to 56	sd	5
You said you used the 14	I just used those to find out Because then I could put the purple pieces over them to see like Because it was a perfect match if I put that and there was room left for the purple	sd	5
So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012	Yes	b	1
Hannah	So I learned this strategy at my old school	sd	1
So I learned this strategy at my old school	You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	sd	5
You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	You can multiply them both by each other	sd	5
You can multiply them both by each other	So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it	sd	1
You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right	I know	aa	1
The first thing I heard you say was that you know you could multiply the denominators	Yes	b	1
Then youd have to figure out 12 is how many 16	Three	sd	4
Then you had 36 plus 26 equals	56	b	4
Matthew	I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	sd	5
I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56	sd	5
Were going to do	Do I got to press something  because I have no  for this	sd	1
I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think	Yes	b	1
Okay so just do the top one right now 13 plus 14	Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again	sd	3
Were going to learn that in another lesson	No I mean like the one that weve been doing	sd	1
Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112	412	b	4
Does that make more sense	Yes	b	1
I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make	A lot	sd	1
A lot	A lot of more sense	sd	1
Morgan	What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	sd	5
What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	Then that would be 412	sd	5
Then that would be 412	Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	sd	5
Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	and got 712	sd	5
Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to	Not try	sd	1
So tell us what youre confused about	I dont know how to add	sd	3
Let me see if I can  No for the whole class to hear	Okay	b	1
Okay	Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	sd	5
Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	sd	5
13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	Then you know that	sd	1
Ava	You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can	sd	5
Ava the 13 and the 14 are what colors	Orange and yellow	sd	4
The 112 is which color	Light green	sd	4
What does she need to do with 112 Ava	Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	sd	5
Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	That would be 412	sd	5
Ava continue	Then on the 14 do the same thing	sd	1
Then on the 14 do the same thing	Which would be 312 and then 312 plus 412 is 712	sd	5
Haley does that make more sense	Yes	b	1
Which math tool	Fraction	b	4
So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer	No we dont	sd	1
No we dont	Why is it always doing this	sd	1
Which one of those things will make you more successful	Adding	sd	4
Adding fractions or knowing where the iPad is pointing	Adding fractions	sd	4
Is this one feeling easier than the last one	Yes	b	1
Avery  can you share your thinking	Okay	b	1
Okay	Since Mark  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	sd	1
Since Mark  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	That one worked and those are 15	sd	4
And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they	No	b	1
Matthew	I got	sd	1
Respond to what Avery was saying	I think that he would  but but he had to convert into 110 because	sd	2
To convert to 110 because he	Yes because	sd	1
Avery and what do we think about that	I agree with Matthew because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410	sd	2
What I want you to do open to page 95 in your Math Journal	Should we	sd	1
So if I estimate that a 100 times a 100 is 10 is that reasonable	No	b	1
Dont solve it just say Ive given you four and Im multiplying it by 10 to the power of I said three right	Yes three	sd	1
Som what would be a reasonable answer	1000	b	4
Okay	3000	b	4
Why 3000 versus 1000	Because I know when we do 10 times three you attach three zeros  1000	sd	5
Because I know when we do 10 times three you attach three zeros  1000	And then if you multiply by four you get	sd	5
So is it okay to look at the problem and know that four times one or anything times one is that answer	Yes	b	1
Where have you heard that word before	In reading	sd	4
What are we doing in reading	Deconstructing a prompt	sd	4
Okay	And Im going to be with that one	sd	1
Whats the basic fact of five times four		b	4
Whats five times 40		b	4
Whats 50 times 40		b	4
Whats 50 times 400		b	4
Jake share the response William gave	Jake I didnt understand  anyone else talk to me	sd	1
Or sorry Katie tell me what your partner said	He said that he knows that five times four is 20	sd	5
He said that he knows that five times four is 20	And then	sd	1
Okay go ahead Im sorry	five times four is 20	sd	5
five times four is 20	And then he knows that the 40 has a zero on it so he attach the zero to the 20 to get 200	sd	5
And then he knows that the 40 has a zero on it so he attach the zero to the 20 to get 200	And then he did the same here	sd	5
how about it please	so five times 40 you have to do five times forty first and then the extension is ending here	sd	5
so five times 40 you have to do five times forty first and then the extension is ending here	Or attaching	sd	5
And why	because times four is 20 and  to do it again but then its	sd	5
So go ahead and explain why you disagree with Emily	Because if you do the same question from before and then just can  its still one 10	sd	2
Tell me where you made your mistake	At just  one because thats only one	sd	5
What		b	4
20000		b	4
Because I have two zeros though why is it not just 200 Landon	Yeah	b	1
Its 2000 but I want to know why its 2000 and not 200 when I only have two zeros	How its 2000 is because if you do five times four it is already 20	sd	5
How its 2000 is because if you do five times four it is already 20	And then 50 times four is ads another two zero	sd	5
And then Im going to attach two more zeros to it	And so what happens to five times four	sd	3
I can attach the zeros	Attach the zeros	sd	1
Everybody whats this one		b	4
Make estimates on those	Do you want us to write on	sd	1
Im just telling you	like that	sd	1
But its three times nine		b	4
Thats not a reasonable one because you know what the fact is	Oh okay	b	1
Charles whats your reasonable estimate on the first one	My estimate is 270000	sd	4
What makes your estimate of 27 270000 reasonable	Because three times nine is 27	sd	5
Because three times nine is 27	Just add three zeros	sd	5
Why is this not working	Did you press the go	sd	1
All right friends these are what type of fractions	Improper	sd	4
All right once again what type of fractions are those	Improper fractions	sd	4
What are we turning these improper fractions into everyone	Mixed numbers	sd	4
All right go ahead Mariah tell us what you did and how you got your answers	Which one of them	sd	1
Does anyone remember	32	b	4
Okay go ahead 32	I knew that two went into three one time so that was the whole	sd	5
I knew that two went into three one time so that was the whole	Then you have 12 leftover so I did one and 12	sd	5
Okay what about the next one	The next one I did I knew that four goes into five one time and then left 15	sd	5
Im going to write those fractions down	We could also divide them	sd	4
This part of the fraction is called the what	Denominator	aa	4
What is this part called	Numerator	sd	4
Tell us what you did	What I did was that I new 11  8  3	sd	5
What I did was that I new 11  8  3	I proved it because 11 can go into three three times so thats the whole number and the remainder of two so I knew that the answer was three and two thirds	sd	5
Im not sure where that right came from so I need some clarification on that	Because the	sd	1
My fraction was 113	I took the third minus 11 then I knew that it was eight	sd	5
You can get your paper or you can take your whiteboard	This a fraction of 113	sd	5
This a fraction of 113	You could take three wholes or you could three out of the 11 three times so that  is nine three wholes and then 11   is nine equals 23 left	sd	5
You could take three wholes or you could three out of the 11 three times so that  is nine three wholes and then 11   is nine equals 23 left	Then I got 3 23	sd	5
Im looking at three different ways that this was solved and I want them to explain their thinking okay	Well I started dividing these fractions	sd	5
Well I started dividing these fractions	I knew three and three make its a whole so I knew three times three is nine so I did write those three wholes and you cant add a  23 left because when you add another three it will be four wholes and that would be over 11	sd	5
Did we see a variety of different algorithms up there	Yes	b	1
They were not the same were they	No	b	1
If you get ones what does that tell me	You dont understand	sd	4
How do I graph them	You look at the right coordinates	sd	4
What coordinate do I have to graph	The Xaxis	sd	4
Stella whats our rule	Our rule is always start with the X and then the Y	sd	4
Always start with the X what	Coordinate	sd	4
Give ya wow thats some great language wasnt it	Yes	b	1
Im going to give you	Extrapolate	sd	4
If you look on here my C	It finally works	sd	1
Everyone turn your math journals to page 138	Yes	b	1
Yes	I already did that	sd	1
What is this	It is a data table	sd	4
Do her ordered pairs model whats there	Well some do but one doesnt	sd	4
What one does not represent what is there	The three and seven is switched	sd	4
Okay what about the Is that the only one that is switched	No eleven and seven	sd	4
Is that going to mess up my data when I start graphing that	Yes	b	1
Yes	Because its not the right coordinates	sd	5
Look at the Roberto if you need to phone a friend Im going to let you phone a friend	Yes	b	1
Okay quickly	Carson	sd	1
Carson	The X and Y are going to switch  because you have to start with the X and if you dont start with the right  your coordinate is going to be off by a lot	sd	5
Those arent labeled X and Y coordinates so why is it going to mess me up	Well because the first because the numbers rule between two coordinates	sd	5
Hudson can you add to Carsons thinking	When youre looking at this you start with the	sv	1
Liliths very good	Liliths age because thats the X coordinate if you look on your grid	sv	5
Liliths age because thats the X coordinate if you look on your grid	Noahs is the y coordinate so it would be	sd	5
Im not talking about the same thing if I reverse it am I	No	b	1
I am going to watch you write their ages as ordered pairs because this didnt say anything about X and Y coordinates did it	No	b	1
Do our data tables always say X and Y coordinates	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
This is a data table right	Yes	b	1
Does that go back to what our learning objective was	Yes	b	1
What it actually appears in the data table	Do you want us to connect the points	sd	4
Do you remember why her data wasnt correct	Theyre not the right coordinates	sd	4
Bruce what do you notice	I noticed that its in a straight line going up	sd	4
Is it a straight line going up though	Its going diagonal	sd	4
Its going diagonally but its going up	Yes	b	1
What are the numbers doing	Theyre increasing	sd	4
How old was Noah		b	4
Its not on there is it	No	b	1
Finn your head should be up	I knew it was four	sd	4
I knew it was four	She was four years older Noah because	sd	4
Go ahead	Liliths age was 12 and if you do 12  8 12  8  4 and so if you do eight minus four that would be four	sd	5
Go ahead Hudson	What I did is I looked at the grid and knew that five plus one would be six so five plus two was seven and one plus two was three and then seven plus one was eight so between eight and nine and four is between five and three so itll be four	sd	5
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
Because you got it right there	12 minus I noticed a pattern with number four	sd	5
12 minus I noticed a pattern with number four	1  4 would equal 5 6  1  7 and then 5  4  9 and then those two just	sd	5
Okay	Then when she was six he would be 12	sd	4
Coach him through	I got it	sd	1
How many years is it going to take him to turn 11	Three years	sd	4
How many years did it take for him to turn 11	Three	sd	4
How do you know hes going to turn 15	Because 3  12  15	sd	5
Okay so what number is going to be here	Three	sd	4
Two three six five does that make sense	No	b	1
Show me how youre going to graph it	I see a pattern	sd	4
Is this first number two	No	b	1
What one do you log first	X	b	4
Do it	Thats a point of the grip that shows  recording	sd	1
If you finish filling this out can you run and grab your whiteboard please	Yes	b	1
What do you notice about these right here	Two four six eight	sd	4
Two four six eight	Two one	sd	2
Two one	One two three four	sd	2
One two three four	Okay	b	1
Okay	This would be the X	sd	5
This would be the X	This ones counting by twos this ones counting by ones	sd	5
I want you to think about it in the context of multiplication	I know	aa	1
Tell me	Two times two is four	sd	5
Two times two is four	Three times two is six and four times two is eight	sd	5
What would be my next number here	That would be five and 10	sd	4
Does six times two equal 12	6 x 2  12	b	5
6 x 2  12	Yes	b	1
Can that be the right answer if theyre looking for how many laps he ran with to earn 14	No	b	1
What would be the right answer		b	4
12 x 2 is 24	Seven	sd	4
Because	7 x 2  14	b	5
What are you doing way over here buddy	I thought it was 14 7	sd	4
Is the seven laps run or money earned	I think it s the money earned	sv	4
No he told you they earned 14	You just do seven	sd	4
Seven and how much money did he earn		b	4
What are the coordinates buddy	7 and 14	sd	4
Did you have to make sense of the table	Yes	b	1
Hudson	We made sense of it by	sd	1
Russel	looking at the graph	sd	4
The data tables	The data table and inter	sd	1
Interpreting	Interpreting which Wait	sd	1
Interpreting which Wait	Interpreting which	sd	1
Did you have to look at the headings	Yes	b	1
Then you had to interpret the	The coordinates	sd	4
The rule that was being used in order to write the That was the word	The coordinates	sd	4
Would you agree with that	Yes	b	1
Did you have to estimate things	Yes	b	1
Howd you know	There was four zeros  and eight hundred and ten thousand and only three and so I knew that there was one left over	sd	5
Joey will you read it for us	I will know I am successful when I can explain how I solve fraction problems when there is a remainder	sd	1
Cooper	When theres a remainder you can ignore it or put it as a fraction	sd	4
Avery	That you cant divide it	sd	4
If you have a half an eight apples	Its like a whiteboard	sd	1
Its like a whiteboard	Theres a whiteboard	sd	1
Maybe this ones better	I dont think the color blue likes you	sd	1
Something is up	I dont think no color likes you	sd	1
Right	So or maybe if you push it	sd	1
So or maybe if you push it	Then you have to push it again	sd	1
I shouldnt have you guys sharing	So you could do with the numbers	sd	4
So what if you just counted 1212	And then thats four of these	sd	4
What is half of nine	Four and a half	sd	4
Joey	I have a strategy for solving the 8 one	sd	4
Uh huh	So should I come up	sd	1
Awesome	Alright so Im not going to draw but	sd	1
Alright so Im not going to draw but	So what is 2 and 4 and thats the simple 8 because you go the other way you go backwards thats 8 then its like a division problem	sd	5
So what is 2 and 4 and thats the simple 8 because you go the other way you go backwards thats 8 then its like a division problem	So	b	1
Or do you want to just tell us	I did like the same thing Joey did	sd	2
You did what	I did like the same thing Joey did	sd	2
So you used the relationship between the multiplication and division	That one was a little bit more tricky so you could use multiplication table	sd	4
Huh	You can use the multiplication table out of this	sd	4
You want to show us Rylen	Can I come up	sd	1
Can you what	Can I come up	sd	1
Uhhuh	Well I did the same as Logan	sd	2
Well I did the same as Logan	I did 13 divided by three to get nine	sd	5
Okay so you took 13 divided by three	Yeah	b	1
Thinking	Four but you have a remainder	sd	4
Okay so what would you call that one Four and	One third	sd	4
I do	I just drew 13 and then cut one into thirds and then the others are four	sd	5
Cooper	So what I did was I kind of did like counting them sort of	sd	4
Or did you just count	I made the lines first and I circled each four so then I had four fifteen and thirteen	sd	5
I made the lines first and I circled each four so then I had four fifteen and thirteen	And then the remainder of one which I recorded as a fraction	sd	5
So thatll be another way to show	Mrs Gibson	aa	1
Mrs Gibson	Real quick	aa	1
Real quick	I dont think that 13 correct because if you add them together that equals a whole	sd	5
I dont think that 13 correct because if you add them together that equals a whole	So wouldnt that be over	sd	5
So 12 plus one is 13	Oh yeah	b	1
Yep	Basically so putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	sd	4
Basically so putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	And then 2	sd	4
Chase you want to show us or tell us	I agree with Logan	sd	2
I agree with Logan	So I did 14 divided by three which equals four remainder two and which I also know equals 4 and 23	sd	5
Colin	Can I draw something	sd	1
Yes please	I did something kind of like Logans	sd	2
I did something kind of like Logans	I drew 14	sd	4
a third of 14	Fourteen	sd	4
Fourteen	And then I grouped them in fours	sd	4
Because theyre dividing by three	Right	b	1
You guys have a new appreciation for what teachers do	Yeah cause theyre all day doing that	sd	1
So what is a fourth of three	Three fourths	sd	4
so yes yeah	wait does it mean like that actually shows whether inauidble or not	sd	1
That makes sense Ian	Yeah	b	1
Someone in here What is congruent	equal	b	4
Which letter matches up with B and the other one	CA	b	4
CA	C	b	2
Someone online Can you give me the next pair of sides that are equal	IG and AT	sd	4
IG and AT Yes	can I restate that	sd	1
Yes go ahead Alexander	segment I G is congruent to segment AT	sd	4
Okay angle B is congruent to which angle	C	b	4
We have to have three pairs	Angle I is congruent to angle A	sd	4
Is that Heiko	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	angle D	sd	4
What does B matchup with	F	b	4
You have a question Sean	inauidble triangle inauidble order obviously	sd	1
inauidble triangle inauidble order obviously	But could it also be like ABC is congruent to the DEF	sd	4
BC	so ACB And DEF	sd	4
Okay so a matches up which letter	E	b	4
B matches up with what	D	b	4
so those match up and then lastly	C and F	sd	4
Okay if you move that side that angle	You get the same triangle	sd	4
Ian	Wait How do we do that without the angle	sd	3
So	Oh no wait	sd	1
because	inauidble	sd	1
So this side right here ad five inch side does that have a side that it matches up with on the other one	Yes	b	1
third side 123123 Are these the same triangles	Yes	b	1
A matches up with what	E	b	4
Which one	E	b	4
Okay so A matches up E B matches up with	F	b	4
from this picture	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	no	b	2
Ian	well yeah because we have the vertical angle	sd	5
Okay so now Do we have side angle side for both	Uh huh	b	1
What was that Sean	HIG	sd	4
What does I match up with	I	b	4
Its like you have two lines and we put the arrow like that	Yeah	b	1
Is this side the same for both of them	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
And same three sides whats our reason	by side side side	sd	4
But what like just all three	LOM	sd	1
So triangle l O M is N O	Wait	sd	1
Yes Ian	inauidble Because its not SAS but  rather SSA or ASS	sd	5
Let me think about that for a quick second	I mean you can make it I guess you can make trianlges on that one	sd	4
I mean you can make it I guess you can make trianlges on that one	I dont know	sd	3
Thats the same triangle right	Yeah	b	1
Okay I need a better example than that	So it works	sd	4
What do we know about these angles here	Theyre verticle	sd	4
Is it finding me	Can I say hi to this person	sd	1
Can I say hi to this person	Hi	b	1
Do you guys know what a treadmill is	Yes	b	1
Whats a treadmill	Its like running	sd	1
Its like running	You can put it on different inclines or different speeds and then you just run	sd	1
You should be selling treadmills	I just have a go to the gym	sd	1
what do you know	I use it sometimes	sd	1
I use it sometimes	Some of them have peloton	sd	1
And you can incline it so it can go from flat to it can go to more at an angle more steep	Do you run on it	qy	1
With a raised hand can you tell me what you think that the 24 represents	The minutes	sd	4
The minutes	It represents 24 minutes	sd	4
what do you think that it represents	How much time they ran for	sd	4
how much time did Winnie spend exercising	30 minutes	sd	4
At least one thing that is the same and one thing that is different	What would you say that distance is	sd	3
What would you say that distance is	30 miles 30 feet	sd	3
Are youre asking what the 30 represents	Yeah	b	1
The 30 represents the amount of time they spent exercising	So their distance	sd	4
You can look there and see if you can find their distance	So what does the distance stand for	sd	3
So what does the distance stand for	Miles	aa	4
Thats probably your unit	30 miles	sd	4
Rodney can you tell us one thing that you noticed that is the same or one thing you noticed that is different	So a thing thats the same is the same distance	sd	4
How far did they go	30	b	4
I feel like 30 miles isnt going to make sense because Sophie why do you think that 30 miles wouldnt make sense	Because you cant walk 30 miles	sd	5
Because you cant walk 30 miles	In 24 minutes	sd	2
In 24 minutes	in 24 minutes	sd	2
Unless youre in a car	Unless youre Usain Bolt	sd	1
They both went 30  what is something that you noticed that is the same or is different	They both burned a different amount of calories	sd	4
Mai at 481 calories and Winnie at 411 calories	I feel like	sd	1
Isnt that how you say it	If the I was in front of	sd	1
anything else you noticed	They were both on the same level of 12	sd	4
That must be an intensity level	I noticed another one	sd	1
Yes	The incline	sd	4
What about the incline	Theyre both 10	sd	4
Yes	I noticed that the numbers by the two hearts theyre different	sd	4
I noticed that the numbers by the two hearts theyre different	One of them is eight and one of them is 10	sd	4
I wonder what that means	810 and that is P2	sd	4
What are you thinking	Im thinking that the 24	sv	4
Im thinking that the 24	Both of the times are different	sd	4
What do you guys think about if we were to compare these two	I feel like 24 is getting a better exercise a faster one	sd	4
I feel like 24 is getting a better exercise a faster one	I think 30 is because youre taking more time with your run	sv	5
I think 30 is because youre taking more time with your run	But shes probably then speed walking when shes sprinting	sd	2
But shes probably then speed walking when shes sprinting	Shes getting the better work out	sd	2
Shes getting the better work out	She has more calories and its less	sd	2
Dixie what do you think	I though that	sd	1
Mai	No Winnie	sd	4
Winnie	Shes definitely getting a better workout because she has longer time and less calories	sd	5
Shes definitely getting a better workout because she has longer time and less calories	Thats not good	ba	2
Thats not good	Less calories	sd	2
Less calories	I think that Mai is getting a better workout because	sv	2
I think that Mai is getting a better workout because	If you burn more calories youre getting a better workout	sd	5
Raymond lets	Theyre going the same distance theyre on the same incline and theyre at the same level and theyre at the same distance but Mai ran it faster which means shes running or walking faster which means shes getting a better workout than Winnie whos jogging	sd	5
So did somebody say how did you get that	Yes I did	sd	1
So can you tell us one more time why you think that Mai got the better workout	I think Mai got the better workout because theyre both at an incline at 10 they both have a level of 10 and they have the same distance but the only thats different is their time	sd	5
I think Mai got the better workout because theyre both at an incline at 10 they both have a level of 10 and they have the same distance but the only thats different is their time	So Mais time is 24 minutes which is less than Winnies time	sd	5
So Mais time is 24 minutes which is less than Winnies time	Winnies time is 30 minutes	sd	5
Winnies time is 30 minutes	So the slower you are the less you workout	sd	5
So the slower you are the less you workout	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Basically the slower you are the less of a workout you get	sd	5
Basically the slower you are the less of a workout you get	So Winnie might be jogging while Mai might sprint	sd	2
So Winnie might be jogging while Mai might sprint	And also  Im saying May because that makes sense May has burned 481 and	sd	2
Winnie	Something like that	sd	1
Something like that	I dont know how to say that	sd	1
I dont know how to say that	Bonnie	aa	1
Lets be respectful of her name	She got 411 calories	sd	4
She got 411 calories	So thats a decent amount less than Mai	sd	4
Whod you see	Well it was actually my only concert that Ive been to	sd	1
Well it was actually my only concert that Ive been to	A couple of years ago me my mom and my dad went to see	sd	1
Nice	That was definitely a memorable concert because it started hailing halfway through	sd	1
Dixie who did you see	I didnt see anybody but my mom went to an Ariana Grande concert	sd	1
Raymond who did you see	I went to Red Rocks	sd	1
Is there anybody who would like to share a concert that they went to recently	Ive never been to a concert	sd	1
when you hear same rates what does that mean to you	That something is the same	sd	4
And what would be the same	The rate	sd	4
And whats a rate	The amount	sd	4
What would you like to add to that	Maybe its the equivalent rate	sd	4
What do you mean by equivalent	Its somewhat the same	sd	4
Can you give me an example	I dont know	sd	3
Do you have an example	Im not sure but maybe if you have different	sd	4
Oh Ive called his brothers name	Mr does it too all the time	sd	1
Who does	Mr Anderson	sd	1
And so maybe Simon and Callie they both babysit and they charged 6 per hour	You did it again	sd	1
And this is also in your packet if you flip the page	Sorry I was late	sd	1
Sorry I was late	I woke up at five in the morning and I needed to drive to Vale	sd	1
So if you flip over	Since when was three tickets 47	sd	1
Since when was three tickets 47	Its 47	sd	1
In a separate place on your paper were going to compare what Andre did	Theres no room to write	sd	1
I need way more of your cameras on right now please	Wait wasnt it nine tickets for 140	sd	4
Right here 141 and nine	I know but it says that you have 141 tickets and nine on your table	sd	4
So it says Andre paid 141	No you have 140 tickets	sd	4
Good catch	Darn thats a bargain	sd	1
Yeah	So we got three tickets for 47 and then Diego also paid 47 for three tickets	sd	5
So we got three tickets for 47 and then Diego also paid 47 for three tickets	So would that be the same rate because	sd	5
Were going to look at some sparkling orange juice next	Whats sparkling orange juice	sd	1
Selma you can go for it	makes sparkling orange juice by mixing three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water	sd	1
makes sparkling orange juice by mixing three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water	makes sparkling orange juice by mixing four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water	sd	1
makes sparkling orange juice by mixing four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water	How did these mixtures compare in taste	sd	1
How did these mixtures compare in taste	Explain your reasoning	sd	1
So draw me a diagram for Terrance please	since Terrance has one more liter of orange juice than Cassidy and one more liter of soda water more in quantity	sd	4
It would be more quantity overall but I would say that the taste is going to be a little bit difference because this right here this is not a onetoone ratio so we cant just add one more of each and itll be the same	I feel like it actually would be the same taste	sd	5
I feel like it actually would be the same taste	So the first one is three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water thats a one difference	sd	5
So the first one is three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water thats a one difference	And four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water thats another one difference	sd	5
And four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water thats another one difference	So I dont think it will be that far off	sd	5
How much soda water	I did five	sd	4
What are you thinking sweetie	I was just going to say five squares but I also feel like Terrances will have a stronger taste because its a one difference but I feel like it would probably be more of a	sd	5
So you think Terrances is going to be stronger	I feel like Cassidys is going to be stronger because it has less orange juice than Terrance but also has less sparkling water	sd	5
I feel like Cassidys is going to be stronger because it has less orange juice than Terrance but also has less sparkling water	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	I agree	aa	2
I like your thinking for both of these	And also it depends what the sparkling water is	sd	4
Can I show you guys a way to compare these	Sure	b	1
Yeah	We can do three divided by three	sd	4
Caylin what do you think that information actually means in a ratio table so far	Maybe how much orange juice and soda do you have	sd	4
Raymond what do you think we could add to Caylins explanation	I dont know	sd	3
Can I help you out a little bit	Sure	b	1
So for every one liter of orange juice how much soda water do we have	One	aa	4
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	b	1
Yeah Dixie	Can we divide it again	sd	4
What do we want to try and get to	Were trying to get to one	sd	4
Which one do you think is easier	Probably the soda water	sd	4
You think its easier to get from five to one and one third	No probably not	sd	1
No probably not	Im not sure but odd number	sd	4
So lets do that	So	b	1
So what is the one in the orange juice mean compared to the one and one fourth in the soda water	Well I guess it means that its not equivalent to them	sd	4
So if I were to say this to you For every one liter of orange juice there is how much soda water	One and one fourth	sd	4
Oh my gosh	No its Cassidy	sd	4
No its Cassidy	I think its Cassidy	sv	4
Are you switching your votes	I dont know	sd	3
Now were eight of you	Can I explain why	sd	1
Can I explain why	No	b	1
Thank you	Im kind of on the edge of both because when I look at the soda lot theres less on Cassidy so I think it could be Terrance but also the answer is greater on Terrance	sd	5
Im kind of on the edge of both because when I look at the soda lot theres less on Cassidy so I think it could be Terrance but also the answer is greater on Terrance	Im late	sd	1
Im late	So Im	sd	1
So youre kind of torn between both of them	Yeah	b	1
Dixie what do you think	I feel its Terrance because he has more soda water and they both have the same orange juice amount but Terrances has a one difference	sd	5
I feel its Terrance because he has more soda water and they both have the same orange juice amount but Terrances has a one difference	But if he had more soda water then how would he have more orange juice	sd	3
Where its like Oh is it close to	Yes	b	1
What do you think Steven	I think yes because they match up with each other	sd	5
What are you thinking	dont know just because one is  in design doesnt mean your angles arent	sd	5

The full would be the red	No	b	1
No	Full wedges	aa	4
I see youre trying to take these What is that	An alarm	sd	1
Compare it to what you did	What I did was I took my  fraction circle and I figured out how many whole ones I could wedge in there	sd	5
What I did was I took my  fraction circle and I figured out how many whole ones I could wedge in there	It was about three	sd	5
Thanks Victoria	It was this one I got a zero because I got a four and a half down there	sd	5
It was this one I got a zero because I got a four and a half down there	Yes	b	2
What did you think Asher	Nothing can fit in	sd	4
I dont really know what theyre looking for	Well I was revising my thinking	sd	1
Were you	Yes	b	1
Can you explain what that is	Its one third and I figured out this entire angle was one third by just placing it	sd	5
Owen	Can I take my paper	sd	1
What if you use the yellow one	I already	sd	1
This is how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle	I said there can only fit one because you cant put another one or because itd have to be half if there was another one	sd	5
What kind of angle is this and how do you know	about like angle	sd	1
about like angle	Right now I just want to say that the inside is  when youre saying yellow here  here its just very adjustable to the sun	sd	4
Who just had it up here with a piece	Owen	sd	1
Owen can I borrow someones paper with a yellow	Here	sd	1
Who can explain why using that wedge	I can explain because that makes about a right angle and this is  angle	sd	5
What did he say Zoe	He said the other one is also obtuse because its more than 90 degrees	sd	5
What did Dan say about this piece	Because it doesnt really look like a right angle	sd	5
Well is this a right angle	Yes	b	1

Do you agree disagree or have a question with any of the values on the board	I do agree with all the values	sd	4
How do you know that all of those values are correct	Because I know half of 80 is 40	sd	5
Does this represent half on your fraction bar	Yes	b	1
Yes	I know that 64 is 810 of 80	sd	5

Harper do you agree disagree or have a question any of the values on number two	I agree with them	sd	4
Which one do you agree with	I agree with the 72	sd	4
How did you get that one	I kept adding 12	sd	4
Because theres 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 how did you know that 110 would be 12	I dont know	sd	1
Emily what do you know	Shall I coach it or	sd	1
Go for it	What I did is I found a number that you only had to double once to get to 24	sd	4
What I did is I found a number that you only had to double once to get to 24	Thats how I got that	sd	4
You could also say maybe half	Oh yes	b	1
What do you think about that	I think that makes sense	sv	2
Amy what are you thinking	If we keep multiplying by 12 or adding 12 on so after 24 you get 36 you add 12 and after 36 you get 48 and then 60 and then if you add 12 to 60 you get 72	sd	5
Mason whats another strategy	You could do 12 times 9 which would	sd	4

You can count down	You can subtract down	sd	4
You have another one Luke	Yes	b	1
Lets hear it	You take 24 and then you double it and you double again	sd	5
what are you thinking	You could do like 36 times 2	sd	4

do you agree disagree or have a question with Emilys statement	I agree with Emily because I thought there is twice too many girls	sd	2
Anna do want to share yours	I wrote for every 6 boys there are 12 girls	sd	4
what do you think about that statement	I agree	aa	2
How do you know	Because 2 times 6 is 12 and 2 times 12 is 24	sd	5
Do you want to show yours Halina	Yes	b	1
Yes	I did for every one boy there is two girls	sd	4
Ethan what do you think about that one	I did the same I did one boy is two girls	sd	2

Dana	What if Mr Wills  28	sd	4
Luke what you think	Mr Lees class	sd	4
Mr Lees class	Because 13 is greater than 14	sd	5
Absolutely	Id agree with Luke	sd	2
Id agree with Luke	Luke said the bar Is that a graph	sd	1
Yes	The graph shows that its a little bit higher than this Ms Lukes and Mr Wills class	sd	4
Yes	Oh yes because you only broke it up into three parts so theres more orange juice and then there is four parts because it fits into it less because its more	sd	5
You can just tell me	I thought there was six	sd	2
Nine I think too high	I think its seven	sv	4

How would you find how much 110 is	We could estimate or you use the ruler to measure how much it is	sd	4
Max what do you think	I use my fingers to measure it out and then just move it back	sd	4
That would totally work	Oh maybe you could use my pencil and then mark it	sd	1
Scratch paper	Oh yes I have that	sd	1
What are you thinking Zach	We could label 14 12 34 and then one whole	sd	4
How is that going to help you find how much 14 is	You could divide the 14 by 300 or you could divide 300 by 4	sd	4
Yes do you know what 300 divided by 4 is	It is 150	sd	4
Keep going you want to divide in half one more time	Then 75	sd	4

Luke what is something your partner said that you did not	She said Ethan said to like organize or like organize the problems	sd	2
Okay and what was something you said	I said you could use your resources  that can help you	sd	4
What was something your group said that you did not	Um something my group said you could use like a diagram or whatever and I said you could use resources	sd	2
And Rob what was something your group talked about	We talked about	sd	1
If I dont understand that do I have resources that I can go grab	Yeah	b	1
And you guys I dont know if its going to give it to me or not but if not I will read it to you	Can we put our whiteboards away	sd	1
Oh let me shrink that downOkay there you go	What I did first is I know you had to draw a picture so I drew four circles out of one plus one half equals one and one half and that again	sd	5
What I did first is I know you had to draw a picture so I drew four circles out of one plus one half equals one and one half and that again	And then I knew that one and a half would equal one and then one plus one would equal two	sd	5
And then I knew that one and a half would equal one and then one plus one would equal two	And then I did one plus 2 equals 3	sd	5
Dan you should be up here t0o my friend	So what I did was I do a whole circle and a half circle close because its one one half	sd	5
So what I did was I do a whole circle and a half circle close because its one one half	Then I took one one half  so I do one	sd	5
Then I took one one half  so I do one	And then I got three equals cause one whole half plus half is a whole	sd	5
Stay here Luke	This is one this is a half	sd	4
This is one this is a half	And then I just have another one right here	sd	4
And then I just have another one right here	And then	sd	1
And then	And then since I have one half	sd	4
Okay thank you	Um I add them together and I get one whole	sd	5
Um I add them together and I get one whole	So I have two wholes	sd	5
So I have two wholes	So um I have three wholes cause of like two halves	sd	5
So um I have three wholes cause of like two halves	So its one half plus one and one half plus one and one half is 3 halves	sd	5
AmyTell me w	Which one that might need some clar clar	sd	1
clarification	is maybe Dans a little bit	sd	2
is maybe Dans a little bit	Because its kind of confusing cause  number one I cant see his  really	sd	5
Because its kind of confusing cause  number one I cant see his  really	So make that more clear	sd	5
So make that more clear	And also might need a little more understanding	sd	5
Would that make a difference	Yeah	b	1
how many sand7wiches did I have		b	4
Not dividing yet just draw me the sandwiches	This is my affirmation too	sd	1
and what was it	I was good in school today and I was doing good lessons	sd	1
Okay what am I dividing those into	four fourths	sd	4
Okay	windows	b	1
Okay so now each friend is going to get how much of each sandwhich	14th	b	4
14th What is it equal	one and a 14th	sd	4
How many	one and a fourth	sd	4
Why not	Because  13rd	sd	5
Because  13rd	Its going to be 3 halves	sd	5
Its going to be 3 halves	No no	ba	1
No no	Im confused because	sd	3
Tell me what you did	Okay so	b	1
in your own word tell me what you did	First I drew my picture	sd	4
Okay	And then I split them up into equal amount of fractions	sd	4
Which was what	one half and one third	sd	4
And 13	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And I knew  that three times two is six	sd	5
And I knew  that three times two is six	So then Yeah so then that one would already be way more than like a half	sd	5
So then Yeah so then that one would already be way more than like a half	So you would have to add two more on to get equivalent fraction	sd	5
so first I drew	I told you	sd	1
circles half  13 I knew two times six equals three which told me I had how many eggs	One half and one third	sd	4
Oh yeah	Yeah	b	1
You just didnt see the next part	You add two and then you add another two because  thatd be a half so then you have to add half and then  because you already have a half	sd	5
And then Alyssa are you done honey	Yes	b	1
Theres four more on the back page	Together	sd	1
First thing you have to do	Find a denominator	sd	4
How do I get it to a six	Two	sd	4
And then what do I have to do up here	Times	sd	4
And now what can I do	Two	sd	4
is	Three	sd	4
Yes love	So were confused on the last one because this one could be correct 26th	sd	5
If I have 13	The weird thing is	sd	1
thats 13 now I need one sixth	Ohhh	b	1
Make sense	No	b	1
No	Oh so  you are right you half	aa	2
Oh so  you are right you half	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	So	b	1
So	Oh	b	1
You have to divide them into fourths	Oh	b	1
But whats 54ths	One and one fourth	sd	4
Um Luke you done	Yeah	b	1
I would like so Luke you said you were done	Yes	b	1
I would like you to meet with Austin please	No we	sd	1
Oh you already met	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	sd	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
So you did	Wouldnt it be minus	sd	4
We will not been going outside for recess at time we will try to double check before lunch in regards to see if the weather has improved	Okay thank you	sd	1
So you absolutely positively	I need one more question	sd	1
Can I subtract	Uh the one or	sd	4
Gage how many problems do you have done before I answer your question	I have three so I just need help with 4	sd	1
Are you done	Yeah Im waiting for	sd	1
So if I borrow one hole from this how many Am I borrowing from that	One plus two equals three	sd	5
Erase that for me	All of it	sd	1
I need a partner for Rob who is done	Me and Zach are done with the back page	sd	1
Dont move	Okay	b	1
Our friends need help over there Eli and Ethan can you go help them	Zachs helping us	sd	1
Two forths or	one half	sd	4
Does that make better sense	Yeah	b	1
What would a number model be for number two	One divided by three	sd	4
Clay what would a number model be for number two	One divided by three equals one third	sd	4
Did you do a representation or a picture for that	No	b	1
No representations you all did it in your head	I did it	sd	1
Okay Zoey whatd you do	I drew a string and I cut it into three parts	sd	4
How is problem three similar	Well its not really that similar its half and those ones are wholes	sd	4
Well its not really that similar its half and those ones are wholes	But the answer still comes out of there	sd	2
All right Penny hows problem three similar to numbers one and two	Problem three is similar to problems one and two because each time youre splitting it into three equal pieces	sd	5
If we think about division the three is	This divisor	aa	4
What would a number model be for number three Lisa W	For number three maybe one half divided by three	sd	4
Talk to your table group	That way you could count how many pieces there are	sd	4
Finn I could call on you for this	I dont even know	sd	1
Well youre not going to know if you dont even try	How am I supposed to know	sd	1
How am I supposed to know	How do I know something if I dont have to try	sd	1
Finn is the answer going to be do you think the answer is going to be more or less than what we started with	Less because youre multiplying by a fraction	sd	5
Less because youre multiplying by a fraction	Dividing by	aa	4
Laura what do you think	You could do what you did on that side on the other side	sd	4
Yes so split this into three parts as well	And count how many pieces there are	sd	4
A half divided by three is what Asher	I mean one sixth	sd	4
What do you call the answer	Quotient	sd	4
We know that the quotients going to be smaller than the what is this	The dividend	sd	4
I need Cooper Mariah and Annie	Okay	b	1
What are we dividing	Were dividing one third and	sd	4
What would I split this into	Thirds	sd	4
Lisa was	You need to do the same thing that you did on the first one to all of them	sd	4
If we divide one third into two parts we get Whats the answer Matty	One sixth	sd	4
This makes sense to you all	Yes	b	1
Good morning fifth graders	Good morning Mrs  Ms Strathom	sd	1
Sound good	Yes	b	1
Does Ms Strathom have a signal	The charm	sd	1
She does some different things	Shes doing the charming	sd	1
Youre ready to change	Yes	b	1
Do you have partners at your team	Yes	b	1
You are doing problem number	Two and three	sd	1
Youre only doing problem number what	Two and three	sd	1
Well talk through it	Bigger number is the biggest and it makes more sense to add it because you dont have to add ones and make it all confusing	sd	5
Because we want to hear their thinking and we want to think to ourselves did we solve the same way or a different way and are their answers reasonable	For the first one we did 1214 and we got 34	sd	5
For the first one we did 1214 and we got 34	Can we show how we did it	sd	1
Why dont you pick one to explain how you did it rather than all four	1214 we knew that 12 equals 24 and then 241434	sd	5
Would you share with us the other answers that you got and we can see if we agree	34 48 78 and 34	sd	4
Would you call on someone please	Maybe for the 48 howd you get 48	sd	3
Maybe for the 48 howd you get 48	Actually we didnt	sd	4
Are you talking about letter D	Yes	b	1
How did you get that in the journal	I got the 18 from the C and then I added one	sd	4
I got the 18 from the C and then I added one	If its a different denominator wouldnt you try and make the 14 into 28	sd	2
Im hearing you say 14 is equal to 28 and you can do 2838 and what would you get	58	b	4
Heres your microphone so you can explain both parts of the problem	Okay so we knew that 4520 so we put the two right above the nine so 54	sd	5
Okay so we knew that 4520 so we put the two right above the nine so 54	59 what 29	sd	5
59 what 29	We got 45 and then you added the two and that would be seven so we put the seven right here and the four right here and then we did 51 which equals 5 and then we added the four and we got nine	sd	5
We got 45 and then you added the two and that would be seven so we put the seven right here and the four right here and then we did 51 which equals 5 and then we added the four and we got nine	Then the other zero because we knew what was wrong with this part so added it to 14 which equals four and 19 which equals 9 and 111	sd	5
Then the other zero because we knew what was wrong with this part so added it to 14 which equals four and 19 which equals 9 and 111	We knew that we were done with this one so we added two more new ones	sd	5
We knew that we were done with this one so we added two more new ones	We knew that 248 so we put the 8 right here	sd	5
We knew that 248 so we put the 8 right here	We knew 2918 so we did the 8 and we added the 1 here	sd	5
We knew 2918 so we did the 8 and we added the 1 here	You added the 1 here and then we knew 212 so we added 8 to the 2 right because we added the 1 here	sd	5
Clay would you please read your final product	We got 41710	sd	4
Now Clay my question right now for you and your partner is how do you know your answer is correct	Because its closer to estimates	sd	5
Questions comments feedback and would you tell me your name please	Bruce	aa	1
Bruce	Yes	b	1
Hey would you please call on someone from our class	Jacob	aa	1
Jacob	I want to know how you got the estimates to tell	sd	3
I want to know how you got the estimates to tell	Bruce erased it but we knew that 194 we knew that the rule is four less all of the rest so this would just be 190 and then we knew that five is more or less the score so we raised the one and two and then itll be 220	sd	5
Am I hearing you say that you did 190220 and thats how you got your estimate	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Okay questions comments feedback on how they got their estimate and I want you to think about words like reasonable and efficient	What Im wondering is my  is like I dont know but how did you get 1800	sd	3
What Im wondering is my  is like I dont know but how did you get 1800	41800	b	1
41800	Yes	b	1
They multiplied 190220	Yes I multiplied that	sd	1
Yes I multiplied that	I mean how do you explain your answer	sd	3
I mean how do you explain your answer	What Franc and I did was we did 20020040000	sd	5
Will you call in someone else	Georgia	sd	1
Georgia	I thought it could be easier since 194 is really close to 200 I think it would be easier to round it up to 200 and its more efficient because instead of having to multiply 190 times 220 and then 215 is closer to 200 so if you did 200200 you can do that in your head	sv	5
I thought it could be easier since 194 is really close to 200 I think it would be easier to round it up to 200 and its more efficient because instead of having to multiply 190 times 220 and then 215 is closer to 200 so if you did 200200 you can do that in your head	Its way easier than having to write it out	sd	5
Is this an okay estimate	Yes	b	1
Does it work	Yes	b	1
Would you please tell your partner thank you	Thank you	aa	1
Go	I can change grids to represent and solve decimal addition and subtraction problems	sd	1
Say atoms	Atoms	sd	1
Ready go	Explain by representation	sd	1
All right so ladies and gentlemen youre writing this number with a seven in the tens place and a five in the tenths place	Do I write it with a decimal	sd	4
Three two one show	Im not done	sd	1
Ready and go	Seventy and fivetenths	sd	4
My friends I know you have resources at your seat but reminder this is the tens ones and then to the right of the decimal is what	Tenths	sd	4
All right Georgia would you read for us what you have please	Like the numbers or how do you read it	sd	3
How would you read it	90 and three tenths	sd	4
How did you know it was 90	Because nine is in the tens place and the tenths place is after the decimal and the tens is before the decimal	sd	5
This one starts with a six in the	Hundredths	sd	4
You have to think about what is onethird of six	In the what	sd	3
Okay if you could turn your eyes and ears this way please	First  and after the decimal and onethird of that will be two and thats in the hundredths place so itll be 200 and then the decimal and then the sixhundredths so therell be a zero before the six	sd	5
Because we have nothing in the tenths place and the zero holds the place right	Then the six will be in the hundredths place	sd	4
Do you mind reading what it says on the board for us in a nice loud voice	All of it	sd	1
All of it	Okay look at the grid work with the card there too	sd	1
Okay look at the grid work with the card there too	Answer these questions	sd	1
Answer these questions	How much is shaded in blue	sd	1
How much is shaded in blue	How much is shaded in the red	sd	1
How much is shaded in the red	How much is shaded in all	sd	1
How much is shaded in all	Write an addition number sentence that represents the grid	sd	1
Do you have a carpet partner	No	b	1
Can you tell me your name honey	Stella	sd	1
Okay Missy put your board down first please	What I did	sd	1
That means their eyes are on the screen push it up just a tad for us please	I did 0020 which was blue 10 cones I think and I had four of the red cones and seven cubes so I thought when I added them together and I got 067 in total	sd	5
Okay Missy will take a question comment or feedback	I like how you added which one was blue and which one was red	sd	2
I like how you added which one was blue and which one was red	Next time can you label how Like next to the blue you could label 0020	sd	2
Or perhaps like units	Yes	b	2
All right whos next	For the blue cones I saw that there was 02 and for the red I saw that there was 047	sd	5
For the blue cones I saw that there was 02 and for the red I saw that there was 047	Then what I did was 02  047 to get 067	sd	5
Questions comments feedback	Maybe you could put zero in front of the decimal so that we know so that its easier to understand	sd	2
Would you say because there werent any whole grids shaded	Yes	b	1
Asher are you agreeing with the sum or the total being 06 and 007	Yes	b	1
We are not doing that sir	I knew that was 02 and red was 4710 and I added it and then for all of them I got 4910	sd	5
Questions comments and feedback	Well from the 02 wouldnt it be 20 instead of two	sd	2
Lets keep this conversation going	Clay	sd	1
Clay	How did you get 049 because you have to You probably just added wrong but supposed to leave Youre only supposed to add these two which are supposed to be six	sd	3
When you say add these two be more specific	Add the tenths the 02 and not the hundredths but	sd	2
Do you see a little something he could do that would fix this	Finn	aa	1
Finn	Maybe he could add a zero at the end of the two but youd have to shift it over because the zero  you could put it like align them all	sd	5
Maybe he could add a zero at the end of the two but youd have to shift it over because the zero  you could put it like align them all	Then in the hundredths place you can put a zero behind the two	sd	5
What needs to be lined up in this problem	Youve got  there and then the tenth it goes up here	sd	2
What were you thinking	You just think about that you can still add that but it will still be the same answer because they would just multiply wrong I mean add wrong but youre just supposed to add tenths and leave the hundredths by itself to get 067	sd	5
Ones and threes are you coaching or writing	Coaching	b	1
Twos and fours are you coaching or writing	Writing	sd	1
Can you explain to her why she was	What are you doing	sd	3
You need to	We could do it on this side	sd	4
If youre not quite done finish it and then youre going to switch roles and do number	Three	sd	1
How many longs	Two because 47 minus 21	sd	5
Then how many twos	Seven	sd	4
Missy and Georgia will you tell us what you noticed and what you were talking about thats different in subtraction	Georgia said that we had to do We rounded the 47 to 50 and then we did so we got 005 hundredths minus 002 equals 033	sd	5
Georgia said that we had to do We rounded the 47 to 50 and then we did so we got 005 hundredths minus 002 equals 033	After we rounded	sd	2
After we rounded	We needed to round it to help us get the answer thats why but then we got 033and then we started shading in but then we realized that We started shading in but then we realized that would like be adding the two	sd	5
We needed to round it to help us get the answer thats why but then we got 033and then we started shading in but then we realized that We started shading in but then we realized that would like be adding the two	If you shade in both of those amounts youre adding because putting two parts together is adding	sd	5
Subtraction is doing what	Taking away	sd	4
How are you going to show on the grid that youre taking away do you have an idea Asher	Yes what you could do Yes we just messed up right here because we realized that after	sd	5
Yes what you could do Yes we just messed up right here because we realized that after	We shaded it and we shaded in all 47	sd	5
We shaded it and we shaded in all 47	Then we colored over top of the twenty to make it only and then you just have to see how much would be left after you shaded it in	sd	5
James be my coach	You can shade in 047	sd	4
Im going to shade in four longs and how many cubes	Seven cubes	sd	4
Now what	I think you should shade 002 hundredths over 047	sv	4
Because Im subtracting and Im taking away Im taking away 002 which is how much of this	Just about half	sd	4
Does that work	Yes	b	1
Whats left	You can count how many longs and then how many cubes	sd	4
We have two longs and how many cubes left	Seven	sd	4
Can you show me using that what would be an easier way to solve it	Just cross out the puzzle like you did like three	sd	4
Say it	027	b	4
One two three four five six seven 74	A seven	sd	4
You did not do number five	Mr Strathom if I do that can we do any one of these or	sd	1
Let me see because I already	I did the same thing as before	sd	4
Your explanation is right up what we did but you didnt explain why you did it	Okay	b	1
If Im subtracting I need to	Take away	sd	4
If Im adding I need to	Give	sd	4
If Im subtracting and I color and then I color over why did I color over	So that I know its the minus	sd	4
Good job buddy	Okay Mr Strathom	sd	1
No Im asking did it change your answer	Yes	b	1
James come here I need to talk to you real quick	Im finished	sd	1
You have your 74 there and then you colored 36 right	Yes	b	1
I need to really quickly go back Just give me a minute	Do you want to turn these off	sd	1
No not yet	Okay	b	1
Did we solve decimal subtraction and addition problems	Yes	b	1
They had blue which is what	A 10	b	4
A 10 then they added the yellow too which made it a		b	4
Then they added the red to it		b	1
So whats up Daniellay Just join the paradeck okay	Okay	b	1
So its what SS	True	aa	4
Savannah	Is greater than 6 and 79100	sd	4
True or false SS	False	aa	4
SS	True	aa	4
SS	True	aa	4
True	True	aa	1
Miles	How this is true because the	sd	1
Stay standing	nine is in the 1000th place and the other is in the 100th place and the 100th place is always higher than the 1000th place	sd	5
The 1000th place is less than the 100th place correct	Yes	b	1
Six and onetenth is less than six and 99100	Thousandths	sd	4
True or false	False	aa	4
Bryson	So if you look at the whole number then  so you have to go over to the next place and its the 10th place	sd	4
Colton face this way	And the first number like the six and onetenth is bigger because its in the 10th place and the 99 is in the thousandth place	sd	5
And the first number like the six and onetenth is bigger because its in the 10th place and the 99 is in the thousandth place	And no matter what if theres something in the 10th place and the other number theres nothing in the 10th place its already	sd	5

Macaroni and cheese	Everybody freeze	sd	1
Harper	I noticed that there are different shades of colors	sd	4
Alexis	I notices that thirds and fifths are	sd	4
Anything else	I noticed that	sd	1
Bryson	If you do the equation like a multiplication number it would be 415 because theres 15 squares long and theres four that are shaded darker	sd	5
Dan	I have another way you can do it	sd	1
Alexis	You split it into thirds	sd	4
And then explain what	So first I make piece of paper and I split into thirds	sd	5
So first I make piece of paper and I split into thirds	And it might be taller than that	sd	5
And it might be taller than that	And then I turned it this way and made thirds and colored in twothirds	sd	5
And then I turned it this way and made thirds and colored in twothirds	And then I found the double shaded part and counted that up	sd	5
And then I found the double shaded part and counted that up	It was four and  it has nine squares in it so its fourninths	sd	5
Grace	The numerator and denominator is what I noticed	sd	4
To start with the numerator	With the numerator I do notice that in her picture that she did show the numerator which is double shades	sd	4
Connor	That its the same	sd	4
What do you mean	The denominator	sd	4
Miles	Theres nine squares in that picture which means there are nine squares total	sd	5
Theres nine squares in that picture which means there are nine squares total	One two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	5
One two three four five six seven eight nine	Then four of those squares are filled in	sd	5
Then four of those squares are filled in	Which means that there are four	sd	5
Square pizza	Its a square pizza	sd	1
Its a square pizza	That could be a thing	sd	1
That could be a thing	It is a thing	sd	1
It is	Its called thin crust	sd	1
So we did all this being able to put them in the value of the number place value chart and being able to read that	So this is the part we are skipping	sd	1
Okay	That was quick	sd	1
That was quick	Two seconds	sd	1
But I mean weve got more to do	Well yeah but that was	sd	1
And the reason its going to be messed up is	because we skipped	sd	1
I think you need to write down the value of the underlined	Like in word form or just printed out	sd	1
Word form and in value	Do I have to mark that	sd	1
Word form and in value	Oh both of them	sd	1
but its gotten further	zero point nine	sd	4
09 because its	Tenths	sd	4
You already wrote this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Im sorry what	Hundredths	sd	4
How many hundreds	3 hundredths	sd	4
3 hundredths		b	4
Read this read this right here How did you write it	zero point zero three	sd	4
Read the number	The two right	sd	1
Ms Ava read the number for me	8 point 9 hundredths	sd	4
Haley  What is the value in words	The value in words in 9 hundredths	sd	4
And you got it correctly there so just what you wrote	Zero point zero nine	sd	4
Okay	We didnt do the other one	sd	1
How would you say that	zero point	sd	4
How would I say that	34 hundreths	aa	4
Yeah which is greater or 3400 or Mr JACK	248 thousandths	sd	4
read it out loud for me	zero three four hundred	sd	4
Hey Jeff how are you	Its if youre filling out a grid youre going to put three tents	sv	5
Its if youre filling out a grid youre going to put three tents	And thats the whole line	sd	5
And thats the whole line	And if youre filling out the grid for the 240 8000s you would only put two tenths	sd	5
I dont think its going to let me How do I get	I think if you click the arrow thats on top of the pencil	sd	1
I think if you click the arrow thats on top of the pencil	out there	sd	1
For example when you roll a die and you look at it do you guys count the number of dots you see	Yeah	b	1
Do you	Well no I just	sd	1
Or do you just look at it and youre like Oh I know that that pattern makes three	Oh yeah	b	1
You guys ready	Yeah	b	1
You guys ready	Yep	b	1
Is everybody ready	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
On your marks get set	Thats pattern two	sd	1
For real you guys ready this time	Yeah	b	1
After those 20 seconds who do you think is going to go	B	b	1
Does that make sense	Yep	b	1
As your 20 minutes starts	20 minutes	sd	1
As your 20 seconds start now	I dont know I did nine plus nine for the first dots and then I times that by two so	sd	5
I dont know I did nine plus nine for the first dots and then I times that by two so	I add the dots up on this side six and on this side	sd	2
Switch over to Bs	yeah because I saw them as dots so I saw them as nine dots and then I just kind of counted all how many parts there were and then	sd	5
yeah because I saw them as dots so I saw them as nine dots and then I just kind of counted all how many parts there were and then	Yeah	b	2
Corbin lets start with you	I saw nine	sd	4
Nine total	Yeah	b	1
Okay tell us how you saw nine	I saw that it was a square and then I counted the three on the side and then multiplied that by three	sd	5
Okay awesome	Are we only supposed to do one square or all of them	sd	1
Im curious how many total circles you saw	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	I got the same answer as nine for one of my squares and then I multiplied that by six because thats how many there were	sd	5
Okay so you saw one group of three times three and then you saw that happened six times	Yeah	b	1
For a total of what		b	4
Sutton	I saw that one box had nine and then if you look at all of them I just did nine times six	sd	5
Corey go for it	I counted out three by three on the boxes which is nine and then I saw two by two so I multiplied that which is six and then I just moved	sd	5
Okay so you saw one group that was three by three and then you saw that happen two by three times	Yes	b	1
Which would be six right	Yes	b	1
How did you see it	I saw nine circles and then I added nine plus nine nine plus nine nine plus nine and then that was 54	sd	5
Is that right	Well actually I did nine plus nine and then that was 18 so I did 18 plus 18 plus 18	sd	5
That would be 54 right	Yeah	b	1
Oh sorry	You keep showing it	sd	1
You guys ready	Yeah	b	1
On your marks get set	Wrong way	aa	1
Wrong way	Hey you want to move that	sd	1
Did 20 seconds feel about right	Id say 30 but	sd	4
Okay Bs you may get started	you got 26	sd	2
you got 26	26 like this	sd	2
26 like this	Seven times two	sd	5
Seven times two	And then one	sd	5
And then one	Im trying to figure out what	sd	3
Im trying to figure out what	Well yeah	b	1
Well yeah	Thatd be 50	sd	2
As it is your turn	six plus six	sd	5
six plus six	Put in two	sd	5
Put in two		b	5
	Yep	b	2
What did you see	I saw 21	sd	4
Okay	I saw six going at the top and then seven going down and I multiplied those two and I got 42 and then since theyre half dots they only count for half a dot I divided that by two and got 21	sd	5
Eloise go for it	I didnt see it as six or seven I saw it as six and eight so I just split eight and six in half to make it easier to multiply	sd	5
Did you do six times eight and then divide by two	I just divided eight by two and six by two and then multiplied	sd	5
Did you do three by four	Yeah	b	1
And you got what		b	4
Yeah	I did five times eight because I  counted fast enough and then I divided that	sd	5
I did five times eight because I  counted fast enough and then I divided that	Which I got 21	sd	5
40 divided by two would be		b	4
Did anybody think about it that way	No because I didnt have time	sd	1
No because I didnt have time	Well yeah kind of	b	1
what do you think	Equal	aa	4
Eloise do you agree	Yeah	b	2
Estella whatd you do	It was my first time making cookies	sd	1
It was my first time making cookies	I doubled the cookie powder and I baked cookies	sd	4
Yeah and then youll have twice as many cookies right or I guess they could be bigger too	We got big cookies	sd	1
Yeah Willa	A few nights ago we were making soup and we had to grill the  because the soup was like we only got the small noodles for it so  so we doubled the recipe	sd	5
Yeah Sutton and then Eloise	I had to double the recipe because I always make the whole bag of pancakes	sd	5
And Eloise	I think it was yesterday maybe with some garlic shrimp noodles for myself and it was supposed to make five servings	sd	5
I think it was yesterday maybe with some garlic shrimp noodles for myself and it was supposed to make five servings	Cut it in half because I wasnt going to eat five servings of noodles	sd	5

Thats really helpful	I can count	sd	1
Was this pounds	Im not sure a lot of us are going to look at this recipe	sd	1
For my original recipe Emma how many ounces of soup do I need		b	4
One cup you got it and Brynn how many cups of pasta do I need	Three	sd	4
Okay so this is just I have decided that I want to make a nice tuna noodle casserole for my family and I getting ready to make my tuna noodle casserole and I get a phone call from Corbin	Oh God	ba	1
Oh God	I dont like tuna	sd	1
I actually love tuna	But I dont	sd	1
And I would like to bring my family over for dinner to have tuna noodle casserole and do you guys know what I said	Sure	b	1
Sure	Yeah	b	1
Lets do it	Dont make her mess up the recipe	sd	1
Dont make her mess up the recipe	I dont want to eat tuna	sd	1
I dont want to eat tuna	I dont like it	sd	1
Calla how much soup am I going to need	20 ounces	sd	4
Emma how much cheese am I going to need	Two cups	sd	4
I just had to double everything so crew this is still going to be equivalent its still going to taste the same but Im now going to have twice as much	Should we write a sentence out for A	sd	1
I want you guys to tell me how much soup how much cheese and how much pasta I need	Should we tell you like out loud	sd	1
Corey how much cheese am I going to need	One half	sd	4
And Sawyer how much pasta am I going to need	A fifth	sd	4
A fifth	I mean 15	sd	4
Getting ready to make my dish and my phone rings again	Corbin what is it	sd	1
Im like Of course you can come	Can I come	sd	1
Im like Yes	Im surprised they all have your number	sd	1
Its five times as big and I think Im going to have to borrow some pans because I need five pans to be able to do this	No you can have some of mine	sd	1
No you can have some of mine	I have a lot of pans	sd	1
Stone how much soup am I going to need		b	4
Yeah tell me how you got five	I timesed one times five	sd	4
Yeah and Eloise how much pasta am I going to need		b	4
Okay	Thats a lot of	sd	1
Okay so Im about to go to the grocery store and I hear from everybody and theyre like Oh T we have a science test tomorrow that we have to study for	We had a math test	sd	1
We had a math test	Ill miss it for your casserole	sd	1
I have my heart set on tuna noodle casserole	I can come	sd	1
And my family is also like We have a science test too	What	ba	1
I know my husband has a science test and my daughter has a science test	I sill want to come	sd	1
I sill want to come	Ill miss the science test for you	sd	1
What should I do to what I already have up here	Divide it by five	sd	4
What should I divide by five	The first five	sd	4
Sutton how much soup do I need	Two	sd	4
How did you get two	Because 10 divided by five is two	sd	5
Tanner how much cheese do I need	What we need five	sd	4
If I have one but I only need one fifth of that amount what am I going to do	Divide by five	sd	4
One divided by five can be written this way one over five	So just one fifth	sd	4
One fifth mmhmm  because one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth is one	Would one fifth be 2	sd	4
Think about what we did here	Six tenths	sd	4
We need three fifths of a cup	I noticed that if you look at it but that and the amount of cheese are always the same	sd	4
I noticed that if you look at it but that and the amount of cheese are always the same	First one one one	sd	4
First one one one	Second one is two and two	sd	4
Do you remember	Nope	sd	1
Its a one to one ratio	Yes thats what it is	sd	4
Yes thats what it is	And I forget	sd	1
I got to look back at my notes	Three	sd	4
Is it three	Yes	b	1
This is the one working for this one	Wait we just left out the tuna	sd	4
Yeah no youre going to finish because we did pasta first and youre going to finish it with tuna	I mean with like splitting in half and stuff	sd	4
Oh	We just forgot the most important ingredient	sd	4
What would we say Estella for every three cups of pasta there is	One cup cheese 10 ounces	sd	4
Were only going to compare it to tuna	Oh	b	1
Look on page seven at your recipe	Oh the six ounce can of tuna	sd	4
Yeah there is six ounces of tuna	Could you also do a two  of tuna	sd	4
No because in our original recipe it calls for three cups of pasta and six ounces of tuna	But didnt you simplify it	sd	4
Yeah how would you simplify it	Would you do three cups pasta and two ounces of tuna	sd	4
What would I multiply by in order to get that equivalent ratio	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
Tanner what do you think	By three	sd	4
Answer right here	Okay	b	1
Emerson do you want to read yours	When you can divide both of the numbers by the same number	sd	4
Corey	When you divide it if you can multiply it back to the regular	sd	4
Olivia do you know you may have seen this problem before	Home work	sd	4
Its not on home work	I recognize it	sd	1
Do you recognize that from somewhere Gabrielle	I think it was a quiz	sd	4
Is that where you noticed it Hannah	Yes	b	2
Hannah lets start with you	I agree with the cat because the dog took the common denominator whereas the cat When	sd	4
Looking at your model what do you notice from the model	From the model the cat Theres two full circles 2 34 and then you divided them all into halves	sd	5
From the model the cat Theres two full circles 2 34 and then you divided them all into halves	You only have 14 of the next one	sd	5
You only have 14 of the next one	Its really hard to explain	sd	1
Annie what do you think	I agree with the dog because	sd	4
Sawyer what do you think	I am quite sure that the cat is right because if youre trying to find half of a circle 14 of it would be half	sd	5
I am quite sure that the cat is right because if youre trying to find half of a circle 14 of it would be half	14 would be half of what you would need	sd	5
14 would be half of what you would need	Its 5 12 parts	sd	5
I heard you say 5 12 parts that we have	Yes	b	1
Use common denominators to find the quotient	Can we erase the	sd	1
You can erase the first one	Okay please	sd	1
Jesse can you grab the door for us please	Sure	b	1
What should I do first Melanie	Find the common denominator	sd	4
Whats the common denominator		b	4
This would be two and how many twelfths	Two and nine	sd	4
Then 16 whats that going to become	26	b	4
What should I do next Olivia	Make it	sd	1
Whats 2 912 going to become	3312	b	4
What should I do next Emmett	What	ba	1
What should I do next	Divide 3312 divided by 212	sd	4
You can ask questions if youd like to	Can I ask a question	sd	1
Whats your question	I completely forgot how to do it	sd	3
Now were going to do 33 divided by 2 which I can also write as 332 which is equal to Yes Claire	16 12	b	4
16 12 youve got it	Can I ask you one question	sd	1
Brendan will you come and be partners with Myra fast	Fine	sd	1
Bs have you been talking yet	What	ba	1
Tucker what advice would you give Doug	One is like the headband probably fell off his head so many times he forgot and two is that	sd	1
But its cute right	Yes	b	1
Yes	You changed it to halves when you did that so its not going to be 112 its going to be 12 because you changed it to halves in that problem	sd	5
Because were dividing by two right	Would you call it B	sd	4
Hayden what would you say	I would say again like the last one is	sd	4
Yes Amy what else would you like to add	I was going to add that they got that you have to divide 332 but then they wanted to use the common denominator of 12 that we had of the common denominator	sd	5
Reese	It was that the excuse problem	sd	4
Kyle Emerson Sawyer G Gabrielle	I always disappoint myself	sd	1
I always disappoint myself	Does anybody have an eraser	sd	1
This one said 6 13 but it should be 9 13	I knew it	sd	1
Let me see if I have an extra	Let me check if I have it	sd	1
Thatll be a great idea	I got my grading	sd	1
Yes Reese	Well can you do the algorithm in number three thats in the middle column	sd	4
What other questions can I answer for you guys	Number two example problem one it looks like its  but I got 13	sd	4
You have 23  38 if you subtract	Yes	b	1
Then when you find your common denominator you have 1624 minus 924	But I thought that was ninths	sd	4
But I thought that was ninths	Me	b	2

Everyone else who sees it they would be like Phoebe worked on this problem	again	sd	1
This is where youre going to get your stickers if you get oneSanswer correct okay	Here at these ones are we supposed to do we write	sd	1
Thats why Im going to give you a sticker once you have finished your	sticky note or do I just do an answer	sd	1
Is that okay	Yes	b	1

All right when we look at this here what should your maximum value be	Wait which one is it	sd	3
And youre looking for one that has Why do you think that its that one	Because	sd	1
Remember that you cant move them there because thats kind of what Landon was talking about earlier	Wait can you move	sd	1
and Riley nice job on slide three explaining your work	Wait is this supposed to have the same response as	sd	1
It should be Your explanations might be different	Okay but we should have the same answer	sd	2
Whats up	We dont understand how youre supposed to find the median	sd	3
to find the median	And the mean	sd	3
Sound good so far	Yes	b	1
Evan what do you think	I think theres seven people	sv	4
I just didnt hear you	Seven houses	sd	4
Luke do you agree with that disagree with that or have a question about it	I disagree	sd	2
What do you think	I think its 21 because theres three on every corner of the seven houses	sd	5
What do you think are the total number of people	21	b	4
Now Evan how many houses do we have	Seven	sd	4
What is 21 divided by 7 crew	Three	sd	4
Which in this case would be 21 divided by 7 which equals three because seven times three	I didnt finish that	sd	1
How would you finished that	Its 21	sd	4
How are we sliding it exactly	Right three down five	sd	4
So yesterday what did we talk about	We talked about factors	sd	4
We talked about factors	All the rainbows	sd	2
Okay	We talked about a rainbow	sd	4
Carrie	Factor pairs	sd	4
Ben	So a factor is just something to  its just a part of a number	sd	4
So a factor is a part of a number	And a factor pair is the two numbers combined to make the number	sd	4
Eleanor you want to try	I wanted to say that	sd	2
Carrie	A factor pair is the multiplication and the factors are just the numbers you use in the multiplication	sd	4
So a factor pair are the two specific numbers that we have to combine to get that  Whats the answer to a multiplication problem	The product	sd	4
For 56 hopefully you know one factor pair	I do too	sd	1
Diego	Seven times eight equals 56	sd	4
Whats the first branch of the rainbow	One times 56	sd	4
What is it	Even	sd	4
Is two a factor	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Diego what is it	Two times 28	sd	4
What about three is three a factor	Yes	b	1
What about four	Yes	b	1
Four and what		b	4
What about six	Five and 11	sd	4
What about seven	Seven times eight	sd	4
And then we know were done because we touch the middle of our rainbow	Can I go to the bathroom please	sd	1
So what are my factors if I had to make a list of my factors what would my list be	One and 56	sd	4
Diego	One two four seven eight 13 28 56	sd	4
Audrey what would be a factor pair	Two and 28	sd	4
Whats another factor pair Chloe	One and 56	sd	4
Whats another factor pair Nathan	Four and 13	sd	4
Whats another factor pair Grace	Seven and three	sd	4
How many factors does 56 have	Eight	sd	4
Okay you got the factors	Yes	b	1
Yes because Im going to throw something new at you	Yeah	b	1
Ill give you a chance to get that written in your notebook	Do we have to write the whole thing	sd	1
I have to ask have you heard it before	No	b	1
Never heard of multiples before	No	b	1
Thats funny because Ive already talked about it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	2
David what do you think	Adding	sd	4
Okay	Something with subtracting	sd	4
Something with subtracting	Okay	b	1
Okay	Something thats multiple	sv	4
Diego	Maybe its something thats adding	sd	4
Where we learned counting by one that was probably the first thing we learned was ones right	One two three four five	sd	1
We know that	Yeah	b	1
After we figured out how to count by ones we probably started counting by	A hundred	aa	4
Skip counting sometimes we call it right	Yes	b	1
This is really two times one two times two two times three	Two times four two times five two times six	sd	4
Are you following me	Yes	b	1
Right now  Do you have a question James	Well Im just saying if its an even number that were looking for its two times something and you just have to cut the number in half	sd	4
So right now knowing that these are what multiples are I want you to give me the first five multiples of seven	Oh gosh	aa	1
Ill give you a hint this one	Its seven	sd	4
Julia what did you do	I counted seven and then eight and then	sd	4
That works	I just knew	sd	4
Okay you just know counting by seven	Not all of them but most of them	sd	4
Nathan	I counted by seven	sd	4
Okay	I counted by ones	sd	4
Ella what did you do	I counted by seven	sd	4
Julia		b	4
Whats next Eleanor		b	4
Whats next Julia		b	4
Nathan whats the last one		b	4
Is seven a factor of 35	Yeah	b	1
You ready to do one more	Yeah	b	1
Whats next		b	4
	27 36 49 54	sd	4
Remember nines has that pattern do you remember that nines have that pattern	Yeah	b	1
All right how do you feel about multiples	Good	ba	1
Its going to be 40something	Is it 45	sd	1
So we would start and	20 30 40 50	sd	4
Easy enough	Is this the right page	sd	1
Did it tell you they have to be in order	No	b	1
Now it wants you to give the multiples for the factor	The numbers	sd	4
Are you ready	Okay	b	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Oh I thought there was a multiple one	There is	sd	1
There is	Theres another one	sd	1
Theres another one	I think there is	sv	1
I think there is	Yeah there is	aa	1
So Im sure I want to go big right	Yeah	b	1
So Im going to do nine and 10 because nine times 10 is		b	4
Lets see what do you think I should do	Eight times seven	sd	4
Ooh eight times seven we know that one	It equals 56	sd	4
Now this is the product right what are the balloons called	Factors	sd	4
Sweet		b	4
Whats the biggest I can make		b	4
Six times two which is what		b	4
	What	ba	1
Lets hear your multiple of six	Try again	sd	1
I cant make a larger product	Miss did you notice that always the computer gets to the right number	sd	4
Is the computer always right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Theres a button	sd	4
I do want you to check with Mrs Horton	I passed the lesson appropriately	sd	1
Then youre fine	I passed a lesson	sd	1
Everybody know what theyre doing	Yes	b	1
Tim whats a mixed number	A mixed number is a number that is	sd	1
Will you call a friend for help	Lisa	b	1
Lisa	Its a number thats not a proper fraction	sd	4
Its a number thats not a proper fraction	its numbers like for example 2710 or	sd	4
You have that confused with an everybody	Improper fraction	sd	4
Call a friend to help you out	A mixed number is where you have a fraction and a whole	sd	4
Quick turn and talk at your table what is a common denominator	you multiply two denominators together and then you want the sum	sd	5
you multiply two denominators together and then you want the sum	And then you add or subtract them the denominators	sd	5
And then you add or subtract them the denominators	Okay lets just do five six	sd	1
Paul what did you say a common denominator was	Its like whenever you find a kind of denominator that works for both of the fractions and that makes it easier to minus and wait subtract and add	sd	4
What do I have to find in order to make them the same	You have to find the same denominator	sd	4
Im looking for one specific word	Franc	sd	1
Franc	Like when you have two denominators and you use a strategy to find a common denominator	sd	4
Call a friend	Maybe you could use a QCD	sd	4
Why do I have to have a common denominator Clay in order to add and subtract fractions	You need a common denominator to add and subtract fractions so it  like draw fractions and stuff	sd	4
Okay can I actually add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Can you review the conversation that you guys had over your homework	From which work	sd	1
What were you finding	We were finding that  that our answers werent the same	sd	3
How come	Because Clay used a different strategy than the	sd	3
What strategy did you use	I used the Q common denominators	sd	4
Quick common denominators very good which is what	Which is kind of like	sd	1
What do I do	Finding the denominator that both the	sd	4
No you were multiplying what two numbers	The denominators	sd	4
Clay what strategy did you use	The strategy I used is I took the biggest denominator and tried to make the smallest denominator equal to the biggest denominator	sd	4
How	By multiplying it by a number	sd	4
Did you multiply the denominator by the same numbers both of them or did you list	I listed	sd	4
Addisons the only one that actually was here the day we taught that	I think  multiples of the numbers	sd	4
How many wholes are four	Five six seven eight	sd	1
When you and your partner are done I would like you to stand up and you should be getting close to being done	Why is this so hard	sd	1
First one	Well the first one	sd	1
All right go ahead split	Seven half	sd	4
How did you come up with three and a half	First we did seven divide by two	sd	5
First we did seven divide by two	We got three and a half is divide by three one half	sd	5
Brian show me number two	We came up with seventhirds and one and fourthirds	sd	4
How did you come up with that	Two and one third	sd	4
I m sorry	We knew that three times two equals six and onethird plus six equals seven	sd	5
We knew that three times two equals six and onethird plus six equals seven	We got seven thirds and then we just added part of the seven and made it a whole	sd	5
Show me the last one	Me and Ian counted from fours up in We counted our denominator up to our numerator	sd	5
Me and Ian counted from fours up in We counted our denominator up to our numerator	Then we used our answer and then we put it together	sd	5
Then we used our answer and then we put it together	We put N and got four threes	sd	5
How can I check that using what you have there	You count up fours and you keep your answer When you get to four fours you put one hole down and when you get up to holes you keep	sd	5
If you dont know I want you to call a friend	Since the denominator is four you would do four times four which is 16	sd	5
Since the denominator is four you would do four times four which is 16	You add 16 to three and thats 19	sd	5
Go	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Wait which problem	sd	1
Wait which problem	All these	sd	1
I think you know what youre doing	Yes I know	aa	1
Is it more than a half less than one or one	More than one	sd	4
Explain to me why you said half	I thought if you did the	sd	1
Is a half	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Is it going to be wrong	No	b	1
You are done with all the math boxes Kirsten and Charlotte would you please compare	With your map	ba	1
Now we have one	Number five I got a little more than 7	sd	4
How close is it to one hole	13	b	4
Just your estimate buddy	We just finished	sd	1
We just finished	Did you get 12	sd	2
Did you get 12	Did you get about 12	sd	2
Did you get about 12	What	ba	1
What	Did you get about 12	sd	2
Missy	Yes	b	1
Do you think you can explain this buddy or would you like to bring a table member	I think I can do it	sd	1
Russel you think you can do it	Yes	b	1
All right go ahead Becca	For number one I thought it was about 12	sd	5
For number one I thought it was about 12	When I solved the problem I did 5 x 4 and since  and then did 2 x 4 so the denominators 20	sd	5
When I solved the problem I did 5 x 4 and since  and then did 2 x 4 so the denominators 20	Then 2 x 4 is 8 and then 1 x 5 is 5	sd	5
Then 2 x 4 is 8 and then 1 x 5 is 5	Then I did 8  5  8  5	sd	5
Are you estimating or solving	Estimating	sd	4
Becca Im going to ask you to phone a friend thats got their hand up in the air	Ms Strathom which problem	sd	1
Whats an easy way to estimate that	If you thought about it 25 is kind of almost half and then 14	sd	4
Is it almost half or is it less than a half	Less	sd	4
What about 14	Its less than a half so she  like about a half	sd	4
Can you use that strategy that I just talked to you about to do the next one	I said its about  because 49 is closest to a half and 39 is closes to a half and	sd	5
Okay	I said it was	sd	1
Could you show me the numbers please	I said it was a little more than one	sd	4
How did you know that	Because I know that 34 is closest to a whole	sd	5
Because I know that 34 is closest to a whole	I know that 58 is over a half so I  is about one	sd	5
Show me number four Russel please	What I did first for my estimate is	sd	4
What did you do buddy	I drew two circles  45	sd	5
I drew two circles  45	I drew two circles and then  fifths and I colored four	sd	1
I drew two circles and then  fifths and I colored four	Then I had one circle and then I did a third and then I colored a two and I know that was a little less than four because 2  1  3	sd	5
Then I had one circle and then I did a third and then I colored a two and I know that was a little less than four because 2  1  3	45 and 23 is pretty close to four	sd	5
Becca show me what you thought was the easiest and why	I thought that number  because the denominator is the easiest because the denominator is the same	sd	5
Kellen which one did you think was easiest and come and show us why	I thought number five was easiest because 116  116  216	sd	5
I thought number five was easiest because 116  116  216	Then two wholes plus five wholes equals seven wholes so 7 and 216	sd	5
This is the conceptual understanding of this is being able to look at it and know just by looking at the fraction if Im close to a half less than a half Am I close to a half or close to a whole	Whole	sd	4
Juliana explain what you guys talked about	We just talked about that 78 is closer to a whole because its only 18 behind so it will be close to a whole	sd	5
Its closer though a whole because if I do my fractions here Im going to do 18 28 38 48	is a half	sd	4
Then I have 58 68 78 88 or	One whole	sd	4
If I did this with fifths I have 15 25	You did 23	aa	4
Is 35 more than a whole	Yes	b	1
Do two four and five	Two four and five	sd	1
Im going to look is that closer to a whole or half	A half	sd	4
Is this close to a half	No	b	1
What do you think	Seven	sd	4
Explain to me why you said seven Alexandria	Because three four	sd	5
Now to sole this what do I need to do first	Add	sd	4
I have to find that common denominator and you said its 24	equals 24	sd	1
I want you just to estimate	My common denominator is 15	sd	4
Is two thirds closer to a half or a whole	Whole	sd	4
Is three fifths closer to a half or a whole	Closer to a half	sd	4
What is your estimate	10th	b	4
Why 10th	B is closer two equals 9 and got that one answer	sd	5
What do you think I need to do	There s three denominators	sd	5
There s three denominators	There is going to be six times three	sd	5
Three times six equals		b	4
What do I need to do with that	Six and 10 is 244	sd	5
The next one is seven and three	Eight	sd	4
That is my bad	How did you solve the problem	sd	3
What number is that		b	4
Sorry friends	I still have that	sd	1
Karen why do you think its going to be greater	I think its going to be greater because when youre multiplying a number higher than one its going to be greater	sv	5
Kayla can you explain the rule why we know its going to be less than 78	I think its going to be less than because if youre still just multiplying them if you multiply the numerators youre going to get a higher number which will still be smaller than the	sd	5
Gary	Its like multiplicative	sd	4
Its like multiplicative	I dont remember the other two words	sd	1
Multiplicative Gavin	Identity reaction	sd	4
Close	Multiplicative identity property	sd	4
What does multiplicative identity property mean	I forget that part but	sd	1
Kendra I have your	You have to multiply the numerator times one and that always just stays the same	sd	4
Gavin who are you with	Kayla	sd	1
For number two 78   22	Less than	sd	4
Comment Karen	I was  because 22 is equivalent to a whole so it would be equal to	sd	5
Because two over two is equal to	Yes	aa	1
Yes	I was talking about	sd	1
Number three	Less than	sd	1
Less than	Because 67	sd	4
67 is Youre on the right track	Is less than 78	sd	4
What is less than	A whole	sd	4
Gary	You mean like a drawing something you can see	sd	4
Laila tell me one thing you notice	I notice that they used cups as their picture	sd	4
Theres two glasses of water and theyre dividing those two glasses of water into what Ember even though youre raising your hand	Into	sd	1
Look at the number sentence	Into halves	sd	4
Frankie	An answer to a division problem	sd	4
Raise your hand if youve had pita bread	Ive had the chips	sd	1
Its like a fluffy bread and then usually people stuff it with humus or vegetables or meat rice	Oh oh	b	1
Oh oh	Mac and cheese	sd	1
Im going to show you a picture	I like the pita chips	sd	1
Oh and I could	I hate pita bread	sd	1
Frankie whos your partner	Im with Jeremy	sd	1
Im with Jeremy	office	sd	1
Okay three	Whos the third one	sd	1
David what did we compare	We compared	sd	1
Lila what did we compare	We compared number of words spoke on a	sd	4
That might be like for every three words Mariah from our video yesterday said maybe Mike spoke two	What	ba	1
What	Thats not possible	ba	1
This would be more like Mariah and Harvey	Miguel	sd	1
I think you will in particularly	Yes I like  square multiplying boxes	sd	4
Has anyone ever stayed in a yurt before	Im staying in one	sd	1
Youre staying in one right now	No Im going this summer I will	sd	1
No Im going this summer I will	In	sd	1
I understand they do not have electricity or running water	Wed have a microwave	sd	1
Rylan what do you know about yurts	Well Ive been in one	sd	1
Well Ive been in one	I went on a camping trip and it was a bit nicer with like	sd	1
Ive never been in one but Ive seen pictures	Ive been in one that was like a building almost	sd	1
Ive been in one that was like a building almost	It had like	sd	1
I want you to also make sure that next to your yurt you have six people you have a drawing of six people	Are we doing it in this little space	sd	4
Im just looking for you that it looks something like a tent and that there are six people who look pretty happy so you can give them smiley faces	Can I give them sad faces	sd	1
Are they people who dont like to camp	Yes	b	1
Yes	Theyre people who dont like to camp	sd	1
Theyre people who dont like to camp	Theyre in Colorado and theres like 7 ft of snow on top of them	sd	1
Theyre in Colorado and theres like 7 ft of snow on top of them	Its Colorado	sd	1
Whats up	theres a fire  in the area	sd	1
Yes	so we couldnt	sd	1
so we couldnt	We brought smores but there was a microwave	sd	1
We brought smores but there was a microwave	smores but they exploded all over the microwave	sd	1
We can go Yes	Do you like to divide more or multiply more	sd	3
Yes	For the yurt thing with the people and the yurts when you are timesing it by 2 I dont know how to say it but what part of the problem does that mean	sd	3
For the yurt thing with the people and the yurts when you are timesing it by 2 I dont know how to say it but what part of the problem does that mean	Because we know the one and the six are the people in the yurt and timesing by 2 what	sd	3
So that tells me that if I have two yurts I have twice as many people so I can have 12 people	Does it change like it doesnt have  its not something else	sd	4
No its the same proportion	Okay	b	1
can you tell us how you might do that mentally	You first see the 200s	sd	4
Good job keep going	Then 40 divided by 5 is 8	sd	5
Yes Michael	Can I  another	sd	1
Sure go for it	Since 5 is half of 10 what you can do is you can double when youre doing a times you split it in half	sd	5
Since 5 is half of 10 what you can do is you can double when youre doing a times you split it in half	When you divide you just double it and you take off the zero	sd	5
If he knew that there were 240 people and 40 yurts so Michael it sounds like the first thing you did was divide by 10 or did you divide by 2 first	What I did is  with 5 when you multiply you split the number in half then you add a zero	sd	5
What I did is  with 5 when you multiply you split the number in half then you add a zero	But since youre dividing which is the opposite of multiplying you just do it times 2 basically and then you minus the zero	sd	5
With a raised hand can you guys tell me why I want to add that information in the first column Bailey	get to 5 and 415	sd	5
That means that Im going to be at 30 people so 5 yurts can accommodate 30 campers	Wait Never mind	sd	1
What do you think this ones going to be	Subtracting a column	sd	4
If I take away 1 yurt how many people do I need to subtract		b	4
That would be correct but I would prefer to have more chaperones than	So that means to find out how many campers need chaperones we would add this number	sd	4
Okay Im going to pull everybody back together because weve about	When youre done Im going to do the math	sd	1
When youre done Im going to do the math	Im going to multiply	sd	4
What questions can I answer for you guys	Wait	sd	1
Wait	I told you it was	sd	1
I told you it was	Im still confused	sd	3
Whats your question Michael	We did the thing and it got to 180 people and 35	sd	4
We did the thing and it got to 180 people and 35	No on the other problem	sd	2
No on the other problem	Okay	b	1
Your side conversations needs to stop	which is 35 so isnt that how you get the 35 instead of 34	sd	4
And Hi Penny how are you doing	Im good	sd	1
Im good	How are you	qy	1

The second one	I can solve multistep number story about money and time	sd	1
James who is your partner	Ella	aa	1
Did you guys get the same answer	No	b	1
Okay Ella can you explain what James told you when you solved he problem	What he told me was that Luke and Meg had the most because Meg had hundred have and Luke also had one hundred because I wasnt looking closely enough	sd	5
What he told me was that Luke and Meg had the most because Meg had hundred have and Luke also had one hundred because I wasnt looking closely enough	and I thought Luke had one dollar bill	sd	2
James how could you prove your answer	I said that you said that Meg had a one 100 dollar bills so 1x100	sd	5
I said that you said that Meg had a one 100 dollar bills so 1x100	Denise had nine 10 bills so 9x10	sd	5
Denise had nine 10 bills so 9x10	Luke had 100 1 bills so 1x100 and then Dawn had	sd	5
Yes I think it was six 10s	six 10s	b	1
Louie	Maybe he could explain how he got their money and how they got that number	sd	2
Jaden what would that look like	If it was doing the amount of money they have it would be a hundred equals	sd	5
Is greater than or equals	A hundred is equal to a hundred because they both have a hundred	sd	5
Could you show that 100 is more than all the other ones	Yes	b	1
Your dry erase board you just have in front of you	I did a hundred is bigger than 90	sd	5
I did a hundred is bigger than 90	so Meg and Luke have a hundred and Dawn and Denise have 90	sd	5
so Meg and Luke have a hundred and Dawn and Denise have 90	I also did 90 has two digits and 100 has three digits	sd	5

The company received 900 newspapers to deliver	How many will be left over	sd	1
Hunter what do you think	How many newspapers I think will be left once its over is about 100	sd	4
How many newspapers I think will be left once its over is about 100	200	b	4
So what operation does that give you a clue you may be doing to figure out this problem	Subtraction	aa	4
Lucille what did you get for your number model on one seat	I put the n for the newspaper	sd	4
I put the n for the newspaper	And I was doing minus 900	sd	4
Do you think that would give you your answer	No	b	1
Hunter what are you thinking	Im thinking that you should do 300 minus and then you put all of the customers and all the sides	sd	5
Im thinking that you should do 300 minus and then you put all of the customers and all the sides	And those little things are like this and then equals on	sd	5
Curtis what do you think about that	So I would think I wait what do I think about his answer	sd	1
So he said 300 minus and you put all the numbers in parentheses and add those together equals n	Its 900	sd	4
Lucille what is N stands for	Newspapers	sd	4
Curtis	I rounded up	sd	4
I rounded up	I counted all the customers	sd	4
I counted all the customers	Its 776	sd	4
Can you explain what you did to get that answer	I added up all the customers through So I added 600 all the 100 150 all the tens and 23 for all the ones	sd	5
Margaret	Estimate how much it will about be	sd	4
Hey Hunter what did you get for your estimate	I got about 120	sd	4
What strategy did you use for estimating	So I did the same estimate as my number model but I rounded down to the nearest 10	sd	5
So I did the same estimate as my number model but I rounded down to the nearest 10	And then I subtracted 780 from 900 to get 120	sd	5
What Hunter	You can we could run that to the nearest 100	sd	4
Are you guys doing okay	Arthurs not telling us what he got for his answer	sd	1
Arthur did you get an answer	So I got my answer	sd	1
So I got my answer	My answer	sd	1
Ill be right back	So Arthur can you please tell us what you got for your answer	sd	3
What was your first dancer	three	sd	4
Curtis	377 papers left	sd	4
Okay does everybody agree	I mean 337	sd	4
Does anybody agree or disagree	I disagree	sd	2
I disagree	I got 127 papers	sd	4
I got 127 papers	And I got my answer by partial sums	sd	5
And I got my answer by partial sums	And when I added all the numbers up I got 773	sd	5
And when I added all the numbers up I got 773	And then I subtracted the numbers	sd	5
And then I subtracted the numbers	And 900 minus 773 cannot equal anything thats in the three hundreds	sd	5
Margaret what do you think about that	I agree	aa	2
Did you also get 127 for that	Yeah	b	1
Lucille what do you think you might say	I think I may say what method I did and how I got my answer	sd	4
How close is your answer to the estimate	Its only seven away	sd	4
Awesome job	Because two	sd	1
Because two	Lets move on to number two	sd	1
What did you guys come up with for your answer and estimate	What I put for my answer well we came up with our answer is 129	sd	5
What I put for my answer well we came up with our answer is 129	Okay so what I did was I added up 237 and 158 to get 378	sd	5
Okay so what I did was I added up 237 and 158 to get 378	And then I did um then I added the other two up and then I got 493	sd	5
And then I did um then I added the other two up and then I got 493	And then I and then when I added those 493 and 378	sd	5
And then I and then when I added those 493 and 378	I got 871 and then I did 871 minus 900 to get 129	sd	5
I got 871 and then I did 871 minus 900 to get 129	And my estimate was 130	sd	5
Do you want to hear why	Yes	b	1
And see what you come up with	Okay	b	1
Okay	Three seventyeight one two	sd	4
Why did you say Ah Desmond	I just figured it out	sd	1
I just figured it out	I a little bit figured it out	sd	1
What did you figure out	I figured out I actually did do it wrong but just a little bit	sd	4
What did you guys come up with your answer	Got 391	sd	4
Wait is that when you added and then subtract it from 900	No thats the one that I did	sd	1
No thats the one that I did	I did 158 and 237	sd	4
And that might make it a little more efficient for you	Im not I dont really Im Im not very good at that method but	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
And then what did you guys get for your estimate on number one	I got 130	sd	4
And did you round to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100	I think nearest 10	sv	4
Okay and then you subtracted	Yeah	b	1
Desmond can you read number two	I will yeah	b	1
I will yeah	New Hyde Park Village	sd	1
New Hyde Park Village		b	1
	Old Bethpage 5523	sd	1
Old Bethpage 5523	Oyster Bay 6707	sd	1
Oyster Bay 6707	Whiting River 7719	sd	1
Whiting River 7719	Riverhead Town	sd	1
Riverhead Town	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on		b	1
	And then how many more people live in Riverhead Town than the other four towns combined	sd	1
So right now see if you can do it	Add them all up	sd	4
Okay	Youre going to have to add them up	sd	4
Youre going to have to add them up	But first but after when theyre all added up you have to subtract that number from the how many newspapers they	sd	4
It says what		b	4
Emanual what did you do for your equation	I just did	sd	1
I just did	I did all the all the numbers of them together	sd	4
I did all the all the numbers of them together	And I just said equals y	sd	4
And I just said equals y	With the unknown	sd	4
What do you think about that	What Im going to try to do first is Im going to take all the biggest numbers then add them together	sd	4
What Im going to try to do first is Im going to take all the biggest numbers then add them together	And then but Im going to round to the nearest 100 first	sd	4
Youre rounding	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense	Uhhuh	b	1
Uhhuh	I was wondering where everybody else was	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thank you	aa	1
How are you doing	Im good	sd	1
Im good	How are you doing	sd	1
Well thanks for asking you feeling better today	Yeah	b	1
So like look through the notes and stuff but also make sure you get that homework assignment turned in Okay	Okay	b	1
We are missing Kyra and Evan today	Um can I just go to the bathroom really fast	sd	1
How are you doing Kyra	Good	ba	1
Good	How about you	sd	1
Fried egg	Awesome	sd	1
Awesome	I could do a drum roll	sd	1
I dont think we did	Yeah I dont think we did	sd	1
What are the two things we need in our equation	Is it the slope and the y intercept	sd	4
What did I label underneath these coordinates	the x and the y	sd	4
So hopefully yours will start working as well	Is it half of nine	sd	4
Close What are these both divisible by	three	sd	4
And you put them in the equation and then you subtract and divide	If its already a negative number do you have to switch the symbol from minus to plus or just keep it as minus	sd	3
What is negative three minus six	negative nine	sd	4
So does that answer your question	No	b	1
No	My second question right	sd	1
My second question right	Or or the question was about the second row because	sd	3
Oh I see	x one is a negative number	sd	4
x one is a negative number	I dont know if I should be changing that	sd	3
That makes sense Rylee	Yeah that helps	aa	1
Were going to be working with a problem that talks to us about fundraising today so its fun	Because its funraising	sd	1
Danny has a collection of 45 shells	I dont have	sd	1
Everybody else sit down	so I knew 5 x 9  45 and you take 1 x 45  45 and I got 9	sd	5
You dont agree	No I agree	sd	2
No I agree	Theres a little mistake	sd	2
What did he do wrong	You cant divide 15 by 45 right there	aa	2
You cant divide 15 by 45 right there	You could	sd	2
You could	Youll get like 45	sd	2
Youll get like 45	No not 15	sd	2
No not 15	You have to do 45	sd	2
Sarah sweet girl we moved right into math honey so go ahead	No Ive heard you	sd	1
No Ive heard you	Clays in the bathroom	sd	1
Okay Matty come to the front of the room tell us what you got and what you did	What I did was I did 10   10 which I knew that 10 x 10 is 100 so hes raised 10	sd	5
So hes earned 10	Yes	b	1
Missy explain what part of Mattys answer you dont agree with and why	The part of Mattys answer I dont agree with was you would do 100   110	sd	2
Nice job Matty	She has a very long way to go	sd	1
Bless you	Bless you	sd	1
I dont want a two	Press freeze again	sd	1
Press freeze again	Press freeze	sd	1
Press freeze	Everyone does it	sd	1
Go ahead Roberto show us what you did and explain why you did what you did	What I did is I estimated	sd	4
Okay go ahead	What I did is I estimated 05 to 1 then I did 1 x 410  410	sd	5
What I did is I estimated 05 to 1 then I did 1 x 410  410	That was my estimate then I said 410 is correct	sd	5
Closest to	Is closest to 205 so if half of 1 is 05 another half of 410 is 205	sd	5
That is the detailed part of the explanation that is missing	Bless you	sd	1
Can I help you	Yes	b	1
We automatically know that if were multiplying something by one what does that tell us	Its the same number	sd	4
If I have 25 what am I going to round up to	To a three	sd	4
Okay so were going to make that a three and then were going to go times		b	4
Would it be easier just to do it by 400	Yes	b	1
Okay so whats that		b	4
What comes closest to it		b	4
Bless you	Bless you	sd	1
Bless you	Thank you	aa	1
You may use Mariahs chair Clayl	Using a what	sd	1
You may use Mariahs chair	Where is she	sd	1
Where is she	Right here	aa	1
Right here	No right here Clayl	sd	1
No right here Clayl	What	ba	1
All right so Im going to have Martin come first and explain what he chose for number two and why	What I chose for number two was 1 x 410  410 because 1 x 410  410 because anything times one is the same number	sd	5
Roge	Did number three Mike	sd	1
Hes like Seriously Ms Strathom	I did 1045 because 25 if you round it up you get three and 410 x 3  1230	sd	5
I did 1045 because 25 if you round it up you get three and 410 x 3  1230	So you have to take four because you added 12 to your 25	sd	5
Did I add a half or cut a half from three	Cut a half	sd	4
Was it easier if you did 410 x 3 or would it have been easier to do 400 x 3	Easier to do 400 x 3	sd	4
This is what I need you to do today	For show do you like draw a picture	sd	4
You could use the mathematical process that you used	What youre going to do on the first column here	sd	3
Youre coming up with an answer on the first one so if you show me on the front how you did it always would be on the back would be your explanation part	to write that in words	sd	4
Any other questions	No	b	1
So Martin Clayl Georgia Sarah Missy and Matty and Ashley will you just join me quickly on the floor up here but I need one person from every table to come see me	Wait can we work at the back table	sd	1
I need one of those back	Can we work at the back table	sd	1
Did everybody get papers	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	1
The first time I go there arent a lot of pizza options there are inbetween pizzas theres not a lot that I like so I grab two pieces if I grab two pieces what fraction of the pizza did I take	26	b	4
Im staying there and Im feeling really full and Mr Cals and says Hey crazy lady how much pizza did you eat	56	b	4
Do you agree with that	Yes	b	2
Israel whatd you do	Because if you add 3  2 is five and the denominators are the same so you just add 3  5  5 and 56	sd	5
what do you think	Because theyre all the same	sd	5
Does that have anything to do with how many slices I ate	No	b	1
No thats just telling me the size of the slice that I ate really not telling me how many right	The number never changed or theres nothing else to add there because its the same thing and theyre not two different numbers theyre just one just showing the others theyre basically a mirror just the top of the mirror is not the same	sd	5
The second time I go how many do I get	Three	sd	4
The size of my pizza didnt change the shape of my pizza didnt change	Its how many	sd	4
You want to try some more	Sure	b	1
Sure	I think shes going to do the opposite of what she did now	sd	4
All right lets stick with six lets stick with the denominator of six	Lets do the	sd	1
46  36	Thought we did that to all denominators	sd	4
You did yes but did I ever teach you any of that	No	b	1
Renata tell me your answer and walk me through it	My answer is one whole and 16 equals It went over number six and you got one whole and then there was no  for this one so its 16	sd	5
Your thinking is correct I want to take a step back how did we get to this part	We just add those two but since it makes a whole youre grabbing another slice	sd	5
When we added these two what did we get	Seven	sd	4
Do we have to do anything to our denominator	No	b	1
Did I ask you to go that far	No	b	1
Raise your hand if you got this answer	Should have picked me	sd	1
All right youre ready for something a little more challenging	Yes	b	1
All right lets say for Avorys dress I need 1 and 23 of yard of fabric	Can I go to the bathroom to get some water	sd	1
That accurately represent what I want	Yes	b	1
How many whole yards do I already have	You have two	sd	4
Can I add two thirds plus one third	Yes	b	1
Yes	That makes a whole another	sd	4
That makes us three thirds or	A whole	sd	4
How many yards do I need	Three	sd	4
Yes nay	Yes	b	1
What did we get	57	b	4
Does everybody agree	Yes	b	2
Do I need to do anything to my denominators	No	b	1
How do I feel	Kind of easy	sd	1
Do we feel like we need more practice	No	b	1
You want a hard	No	b	1
Above and beyond what you need for todays math work	I want to see what happens	sd	1
Whats different	The denominators are not the same	sd	4
What did I tell you we have to have in order to add	You have to do the same to the bottom and the top	sd	4
We want to have the denominators the same in order to add because if the denominators match we know all we have to do is add the numerators right	I have an answer	sd	1
What is it	Times five	sd	4
If I can change this to denominator 10 will I be able to add	Yes	b	1
In order to change this to a 10 I have to	Multiply by two	sd	4
Multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
Now can I add	Yes	b	1
What do I get	410	b	4
The work that you need to do today	Is on	sd	1
You dont have to do any changing of denominators and there are no whole numbers	What page is it	sd	1
All right tell me the equivalent fractions rule Alicia	The equivalent fractions rule is that they have to be even parts	sd	4
The equivalent fractions rule is that they have to be even parts	And also when its	sd	1
And also when its	I wrote this down but I dont know how to explain it	sd	3
I wrote this down but I dont know how to explain it	Theres a fraction and you were multiplying by something with that fraction and if you have the answer to the numerator you might find what is multiplied on the numerator	sd	5
Theres a fraction and you were multiplying by something with that fraction and if you have the answer to the numerator you might find what is multiplied on the numerator	And then on the bottom you do the same thing	sd	5
So Alicia can you give me an example of a fraction	Six times ten	sd	4
Six times ten	I mean	sd	1
Okay so six tenths	Six tenths	sd	4
Six tenths	Yes thats what I meant	sd	1
So Arcane give me a number that I can multiply six tenths by to get an equivalent fraction	Can it be any number	sd	1
Any number but I would make it one through twelve just to make it easier	Okay	b	1
What would my new denominator be	The new denominator would be which one the top one or the bottom one	sd	3
Oh so do we need to know the definition of denominator to be able to figure out what Im asking	I forgot it from the weekend	sd	1
Is it the top number or bottom number Troy	I think the denominator is the bottom number	sd	4
Darnell do you agree with Troy	Hmm	sd	1
Theyre trying to give you a hint	Yeah	b	1
Okay so Darnell now knowing that the denominator is the bottom number what would the denominator of my new fraction be	It would be 90	sd	4
What would my numerator be Kyle	Hello	sd	1
Hello	I know	aa	1
All right Arcane tell me what would the numerator would be		b	4
Bonnie	I think that 54 90ths are going to have the smaller pieces because its 54 out of 90 when the other ones only six out of 10	sd	5
How big would the 90ths be	Thats 12	ba	4
What is a factor Arcane	Did you call me	sd	1
I did	Well I know the answer but I dont really know how to explain it but its You skip count	sd	4
Arcane	But its because I forgot but I did those in ST	sd	1
But its because I forgot but I did those in ST	Math	sd	1
So do you remember now or do you need to phone a friend	Phone a friend	sd	1
All right Arcane phone a friend	Hmm	sd	1
Hmm	Bonnie	aa	1
Bonnie	A factor is the two numbers that you put together to make a multiplication problem	sd	4
A factor is the two numbers that you put together to make a multiplication problem	For example two and two equals four	sd	4
For example two and two equals four	So two would be a factor	sd	4
Carmen what can I multiply together to get two	Sorry one times two	sd	4
If you know a factor of eight I want you to unmute and tell me	Two times four	sd	4
Two times four	One and eight	sd	2
One and eight	Two times four	sd	4
Two times four	Three times eight	sd	2
What factors do two and eight have in common Janessa	What do what	sd	1
What two factors do two and eight have in common	Those two factors have in common its that you can multiply two numbers so it can be a bigger number	sd	4
Do they have any numbers in common Janessa	Yes they do	sd	4
Yes they do	They have the four and the eight	sd	4
So wait do I see a four up here in this one	Oh wait	sd	1
Oh wait	No	b	1
No	So what do I see in both lists	sd	1
So what do I see in both lists	You can see that theres two numbers that are the same one and two and the bottom ones one and two	sd	4
How many times can I fit two into two	One time	sd	4
Im looking for a hand or Im going to call on somebodyactually yeah lets go to Kyle T Kyle T eight divided by two	Its four	sd	4
Okay	I also have something that I see that is in the fractions that are	sd	1
I also have something that I see that is in the fractions that are	I noticed something about them	sd	1
I noticed something about them	Is that besides the one in the factors of eight theyre all counting by two	sd	5
Very interesting absolutely	No six but eight is still something that you can get by counting by twos	sd	5
Lets see lets go to Jackie	Yes	b	1
How am I going to use the knowledge of using a common factor of two to create an equivalent fraction for two sixths	Making the answer	sd	1
Yep	Hmm	sd	1
Hmm	So you cant divide two and two	sd	4
I cant	I think	sv	1
How am I going to find out my denominator	Six divided by two is three	sd	5
If you know factor of six I want you to yell it out for me	One and six	sd	4
One and six	Three	sd	2
Three	Yeah	b	2
What can I multiply together to get 12	Six and two	sd	4
Six and two	Two and four	sd	2
Two and four	Two and six	sd	2
Two and six	I already did that	sd	1
One	You have to count by four and it equals eight	sd	4
Matteo whats a factor that you see on both lists	One two three and six	sd	4
River which factor should I use	Hmm	sd	1
Hmm	Phone a friend	sd	1
River just look at the circled fractions pick one	Oh	b	1
Oh	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Two two	sd	1
So how many times did I count by two	Oh three	ba	4
What about my denominator	Hmm	aa	1
Hmm	Six I think	sv	4
What other factor could I use Alicia	Three	sd	4
Okay Alicia tell me how I would use three	So you would divide them by three and on the denominator for that is two on the I mean the numerator	sd	4
Ah the numerator is two why is the numerator two	Because you can fit three two times into six	sd	5
And what about the denominator	Four because if you count four three times it would be 12	sd	5
What are we going to do with it Jacob	What	ba	1
What do we do with them	Can I phone a friend	sd	1
If you know what we do with this four I want you to raise your hand	Lionel	sd	1
Gio what are we going to do with this four	What you guys do about the four so you know how eight times two equals 14 Well eight that would make 16	sd	5
What you guys do about the four so you know how eight times two equals 14 Well eight that would make 16	And if you have two more Now Im confused	sd	3
Karla what are we going to do with the four	Divide it	sd	4
So eight divided by four Karla what is eight divided by four	Hmm	sd	1
How many times can I count out four to get eight	Two times	sd	4
And what about 12 divided by four	Three	sd	4
Do this on your paper	T	b	1
Yes	Can I type in the chat once I find my answer	sd	1
Sophia what are we going to do	Take away	sd	4
Paulina	Were going to divide	sd	4
You had your hand up a minute ago	Im sorry	sd	1
Its okay	It will only fit one time	sd	4
And what about my denominator	The denominator will be two	sd	4
The denominator will be two	Two times will fit	sd	4
Karla what equivalent fraction do I have right here	One out of two	sd	4
All right	Wait for this work are we going to have to take a picture of our work or is this just	sd	1
So youre not solving youre finding closest to which benchmark fraction	You estimate it	sv	4
Chase	I think that it would be one the reason I think this is because threefifths is already at the halfway point and if you add any more even just onefourth it gets closer to a whole	sd	5
We have seveneights which is already close to what	One whole	sd	4
Kate	Zero	sd	4
Macaroni and cheese	Everybody agrees	sd	1
Brendan	Perhaps a two	sd	4
Why do you think its two	Because it goes kind of close to two	sd	5
Should we call on someone to help you explain	Im pretty sure because threeeighths and twothirds is already really close to one and if you add any more its going to be one and then one plus one would be two	sd	5
Does that sound right	Yeah	b	1
Trey	I think its closer to one and a half	sd	4
Okay why	I actually think it is closest to one because threefourths its closest to but if you minus that big number to a lower one it will be closest to one and a half	sd	5
I actually think it is closest to one because threefourths its closest to but if you minus that big number to a lower one it will be closest to one and a half	It will actually be closest to one	sd	2
It will actually be closest to one	its exactly one and a half	sd	2
Noah	So if you rounded it would be closest to one but actually its closest to onehalf	sd	4
So if you rounded it would be closest to one but actually its closest to onehalf	Yeah because threefourths is in the center and youre subtracting	sd	5
Hunter	I think it going to be closest to zero because twoones isnt going to be two	sd	5
Three two one	I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points to form pictures and applying rules to ordered pairs	sd	1
Flip to page 134 in your math journals	Got it	sd	1

Find the column of original sailboat	Plot the ordered pairs listed to the column on coordinate grid of the original sailboat on the next page	sd	1
Plot the ordered pairs listed to the column on coordinate grid of the original sailboat on the next page	Connect the points in the same order that you got them	sd	1
Connect the points in the same order that you got them	You should see the outline on the book of the sailboat	sd	1
Hey Mason	Fill on the missing coordinates with new sailboat one	sd	1
Fill on the missing coordinates with new sailboat one	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Do you want me to too	sd	1
Do you want me to too	How do you think new sailboat one will be different from the original sailboat conjecture at the top of the column	sd	1
How do you think new sailboat one will be different from the original sailboat conjecture at the top of the column	Plot the ordered pairs for new sailboat one one on the next page	sd	1
Plot the ordered pairs for new sailboat one one on the next page	Connect the points in the same order that youd want them	sd	1
Nate	81	b	4
Go grab your ruler for a straight edge	Miss maam can I have a sticky note	sd	1
Whats next Ariana	51	b	4
Now what do we need to do to our two dots before we go any further	Connect	b	4
Whats next Mason	57	b	4
Next	12	b	4
12	Miss it says 51 again	sd	4
Miss it says 51 again	Or maybe a new number	sd	4
Kate	I dont know	sd	3
They want us to connect they want us to connect back to this ordered pair	So you could make the sail place	sd	1
Now my straight edge is right there and I would have to delete my sailboat from where I have it right now	Wheres your straight edge	sd	1
01	Does that mean	sd	1
Ariana	20	b	4
So it wants us to go 20	That would be on a bottom line it would be on the X axis	sd	4
70	Connecting back to 81	sd	4
Connecting back to 81	It makes more sense now	sd	1
Natalie	Double each number of the original pair	sd	4
Hunter	Double it just says  just eight times two and then one times two	sd	4
So What about doubling zero	You dont	sd	4
You dont	You cant	sd	2
You cant	Anything times to zero is zero	sd	2
Anything times to zero is zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Yeah	b	2
You seriously know a lot of math things like do you know how to factor	Yes	b	1
If you see something that looks like it could be factorable should you maybe think about factoring it	Maybe	sd	1
Should you being afraid that its not the right thing keep you from trying it	No	b	1
Do you know how to simplify and distribute	Yes	b	1
Will you by the time this test comes around in about three weeks know a whole bunch of equivalent identities that you could substitute in	Yes	b	1
If you know this you could rearrange	You see the cosine is equal to the sine and the sine is equal to the cosine which is equal to 10 and if 10 is equal to cosine and a tangent then the tangent or the sine and the cosine go to the sine and tangent and the sine or the tangent goes to the cosine	sd	5
You see the cosine is equal to the sine and the sine is equal to the cosine which is equal to 10 and if 10 is equal to cosine and a tangent then the tangent or the sine and the cosine go to the sine and tangent and the sine or the tangent goes to the cosine	Sine tangent	sd	5
Sine tangent	You see it shows the tangent of the sine when you show the tangent of the sine the sine of the tangent is shown	sd	5
Yes do you want to do it	Sure	b	1
It will make sense	When you look at your Pythagorean identities 1   sin2    cos2    cos2   x tan2    sin2   which is also 1 cos2	sd	5
When you look at your Pythagorean identities 1   sin2    cos2    cos2   x tan2    sin2   which is also 1 cos2	That changes to 1 cos2	sd	5
That changes to 1 cos2	We also know that tan  sincos and so you can say  is equal to sin cos   2	sd	5
Dont do the big theta do a little theta here and a little theta there	Okay all right	b	1
Does anybody have any question for Callie about what shes done so far	Why are you doing	sd	2
Piper	I thought the cos2   would be positive not negative because if it were 1 cos2   then it would be	sd	5
Why is that not turn into a negative cos2   is that what youre asking	Have you thought about the other way in  sin2	sd	2
Have you thought about the other way in  sin2	1   cos2   would be 1 cos2	sd	1
You should have an identity on your sheet that says cos2    1   sin2	Why did you do it	sd	3
Everything is right up here so far	Yes	b	2
Okay keep going	Then what I did	sd	1
Then what I did	This cos   cos2   and youre multiplying they just cancel out	sd	5
This cos   cos2   and youre multiplying they just cancel out	Im just going to write this up here	sd	5
Im just going to write this up here	Then you have left over here sin2   1   cos2   which is true	sd	5
PAMP 51	Yes	b	1
This is a reference to help you	For this	sd	1
This is your reference	Can we work on the delta math	sd	1
Try to work collaboratively for now	I got five	sd	4
Youre only going to give the answer to  because you were	This one	sd	1
Here you go	What Im saying is why did you do it like this when this one doesnt	sd	3
This one would probably be best done by	Then we can	sd	1
Then we can	Wait this one read it like that	sd	1
Or you just add them together	Yes	b	1
look at the Y	Thats how they	sd	1
Then plug that back in	Thats why  then you plug that into	sd	4
Are you guys really excited to see logs show up again	No	b	1
Plug in X in here and here	Then once you find the X you plug that back into	sd	4
Then once you find the X you plug that back into	I forgot how to do it any other way	sd	1
Thats good	Does it matter which one you substitute	sd	1
Quick question how many people didnt do the delta math assignment last night	I did	sd	1
I did	I did all three	sd	1
Would that be too nice of me though	Yes	b	1
Yes	Right now we dont have nice numbers	sd	4
need to keep going	I did XY	sd	4
You did cotangent which you havent learned yet	I know	aa	1
I know	Im just too advanced	sd	1
Stop being ahead of	Okay	b	1
the PAMPs due	Friday	sd	1
When am I expecting these two proofs to be tried	Tomorrow	b	1
Whats the worst thats going to happen	Kill someone	sd	1
Not on a proof	It could happen	sd	1
It could happen	Well if you have bubblewrap wrapped around your car and youre blindfolded in the dark	sd	1
Its 263 so now you have to divide	Hello	sd	1
Now were going to read it together in three two one	I will round	sd	1
Were going to read this one together in three two one go	I will round decimals up and down using a number line grid or rounding shortcuts	sd	1
And we will know were successful in three two one go	I will know Im successfully when I can round decimals up or down using a number grid or rounding shortcuts on journal page 125	sd	1
Does that sounds familiar	Yes it does from last year	sd	1
Yeah from last year	What if its at five	sd	3
Noah	You round up	sd	4
You round up	Because the other digit would be greater than zero	sd	5
Why else do think we would round up at five	No the digit after five it might be greater than zero if there were a digit	sd	4
No the digit after five it might be greater than zero if there were a digit	Plus thats just the rule	sd	4
Hudson	Four or less let it rest five or more raise the score	sd	4
If you would like you can get out a colored pencil so you can use it when comes to shading	What page	sd	1
Quinns ready Kate is ready Tyler is ready Abbys ready Peytons ready Masons ready	123	b	1
Miles	2800	b	4
Is 28 hundredths	Hundredths	sd	1
You and your partners one and two and then well talk together	Okay	b	1
Use the grid to help you explain	Three tenths	sd	4
How do you know	Because its more than 5 or greater than five	sd	5
What part of 28 hundredths is greater than five	Um	b	1
Do you want to call on someone else to help	The eight	sd	4
That eight what	The eight hundredths	sd	4
Whats next	Its not	sd	1
Its not	It says label the number in the lower	sd	1
Two thats what I meant to do	Actually it would be	sd	1
Actually it would be	Wait no thats right	aa	1
25 hundredths mark	Five isnt the fifth digit Its actually the sixth	sd	1
But we know 28 hundredths would be about right here	Yeah	b	1
It wouldnt make sense to say its closer to two tenths after that reasoning would it	No	b	1
So once you and your partner are done with four five and six you and your partner raise your hand and I will come by and check	Awesome	sd	1
This is a really weird way to put it 3 and 619 thousandths cent	619 cents	sd	1
So how much is the gas going to cost them Eli	3 and 3 and	sd	4
So we need to look at the nine	Oh crap	ba	1
Oh crap	Yeah that fits more of the up to the nearest hundredth	sd	5
Yeah that fits more of the up to the nearest hundredth	So that 500 would go to two	sd	5
So if the one becomes a two thatd be 3 and 60	Cents	sd	4
Not 60 cents	I dont know	sd	3
Okay work on those next problems with your partner	Okay	b	1
Mason	Let it rest	sd	4
Let it rest	No I think actually you should raise it because	sv	4
So are we closer to filling in this square or are we closer to this yellow square	Yellow square	sd	4
Are you closer to filling in this whole square	Yeah	b	1
Are you closer to this yellow square Lilian	Closer to the one in the thousandths square	sd	4
Laura	I think that it would be 363	sv	4
Kate	My halfway number is three and 618 thousandths	sd	4
Do you have something to add Noah	No	b	1
Everyone have that so far	Yes	b	1
Whats our halfway mark	Three and six fifteenths	sd	4
Who can read problem four on 124	Round four and 254 hundredths to the nearest hundredth	sd	1
I have to burn almost 10000 calories in 32 days	Or you could burn 1000 calories per day	sd	4
What do you think	Yeah	b	1
So think about that one	Can you mute David	sd	1
Im sorry what	Can you mute David	sd	1
What did you do	I subtracted 16000 with 11716	sd	4
I subtracted 16000 with 11716	Because  maybe if I subtracted maybe I thought I would get the answer	sd	5
whatd you try	Division	sd	4
Tell me what youre dividing	Im dividing by thirteen	sd	4
What are you dividing		b	4
Why are you doing that	Because if youre trying to burn if youre on that right now and this	sd	5
Because if youre trying to burn if youre on that right now and this	The thing for outside the box  burn calories in a day	sd	5
Whatd you try	Division Im trying to divide 16000 by 13	sd	4
Why 16000 by 13	But Im starting to regret that	sd	4
But Im starting to regret that	Because I just figured out that I have to do something completely different	sd	4
Tell me more	I have to subtract 11716 from 16000	sd	4
I have to subtract 11716 from 16000	Because if I get the number then I still need to do and then divide that 13 then I	sd	5
Carrie	First I subtracted the thing but then I divided the number I got so its 13	sd	4
Okay why	Because  to see how much  and then I divided	sd	5
If want 16000 calories and Ive already burned What do I need to do here	Subtract	sd	4
Walk us through Chloe	Okay	b	1
Okay	So what I got by  and the answer I got 5717	sd	4
Okay	Okay when I got my answer I kind of thought	sd	1
Walk me through the subtraction	So six minus three over six  one	sd	5
So six minus three over six  one	You have to trade	sd	5
If I have zero can I take six	No	b	1
Diego	So  for six and Ive got a five	sd	5
So  for six and Ive got a five	a ten and a nine but I dont have	sd	5
I think I lost you  right here you did 10 minus six and got four nine minus one and got	Eight	sd	4
If I dont eat for two days	I was close	sd	1
I was close	Now I see where I messed up	sd	1
Now I see where I messed up	I just forgot my trade	sd	4
Carrie	Im pretty sure you divide 4000 by 13	sd	4
Why would you divide	Because you can divide it by  so that way  each day how much	sd	5
Thirteens  are not something that weve memorized very well	No	b	1
So 13 times one 13 times two is 26 13 times three  equals 39	multiplication problems because I can just add zero to everything	sd	5
That gets me pretty close huh	Yeah	b	1
Chloe can I do two minus nine	No	b	1
Whats 12 minus nine	Three	sd	4
What do you think comes next	Add that thing	sd	4
what do you think	13 times 20	sd	4
What does 13 times 20 get me		b	4
Yeah	Oh my god its going to be too big	sd	4
39 Because I might charge so I know that  this will be 12	Are we just going  to keep subtracting by 39	sd	4
Maybe because thats what I know right now	I did some	sd	1
I did some	I did 13 times 20	sd	4
Okay so 85 and another three is 39		b	1
	49	b	1
Thats with a remainder of seven	Yeah	b	1
Okay so I have 300 plus 20 plus three plus three plus three		b	4
And zero plus two is		b	2
James	To be really precise to get to that exact goal	sd	4
To be really precise to get to that exact goal	In exactly 13 days you burn  329 and seven thirteenths	sd	4
And seven thirteenths right	Or you can just burn 330	sd	4
If I round it up since 330 Im going to make sure I hit the goal and Ill probably have a few extra calories on top	Yeah	b	1
I can totally do that right	Yeah you could totally do it	sd	4
Yeah you could totally do it	If thats so easy how about 660	sd	3
How many 50 I need how many calories		b	4
So I can subtract that right	Yes	b	1
Subtract that really quick	Im going to trade this time	sd	4
Im going to trade this time	Trade	sd	4
Trade	Do I have to  trade	sd	1
Do I have to  trade	I want to try and walk us through it one more time	sd	1
Is it doable	Im not thinking in one day	sd	4
Well not in one day but 13 days	Maybe	sd	1
walk me through this	So we cant do any of those so  make it as a zero and then add 10  10 minus six	sd	5
So we cant do any of those so  make it as a zero and then add 10  10 minus six	No you move the two into a one then that one	sd	5
Were going to cheat for this last part in honor of time and just go to the calculator	Aww I was so close	sd	1
If I have 9284 calories and I divide that over 13 days thats 714 hours a day	You want to do it	sd	1
Thats not too bad	Thats not that bad	sv	1
Thats not that bad	You can make it	sd	1
You can make it	Okay then you do it	sv	1
So then I have to do three and a half yogas a day	But dont you like yoga	sd	1
I do	I have three extra hours Ill do it	sd	1
Why are you not reading for 30 minutes if you have three extra hours	Okay thats	ba	1
But I think right now were just going for the 40	about the	sd	1
about the	You said it last time	sd	1
I dont remember  that	When you first got into the gym	sd	1
When you first got into the gym	The ab workout	sd	1
Oh yeah the ab workout	Ms  I have a great idea for you	sd	1
Yeah	So whats the hardest one and the one you can burn the most calories	sd	1
Usually Id say yoga	Okay then how many hours do you have by yourself	sd	1
Zero	Okay	b	1
Okay	I know that	sd	1
I know that	Unless he drops it off to her parents house	sd	1
Unless he drops it off to her parents house	Okay but if thats possible then you should  at least be able to do two and a half hours and get 400 calories	sd	1
Sure	Maybe	sd	1
Yeah and Ill just ignore my family and my children	Okay lets go	sd	1
Okay lets go	I will help you burn the calories lets go into her account and then every single day  goal	sd	1
So lets go back to this	Oh that was hard	sd	1
Whats a fruit basket	A basket of fruit	sd	1
So if you picture after and hes standing there and all of these people brought him the oranges what is he going to do	Put them in a basket	sd	4
You following	Uhhuh	b	1
What do we need to know first	So its not exactly what I did but I counted up all the oranges so each one where he brought every single one and	sd	4
Do we know how many oranges he has	Yeah	b	1
We have to do something here	We have to add	sd	4
Once we know how many oranges he had what are we going to do with	Divide it by five	sd	4
Divide it by five	Because the number of baskets is multiplication	sd	5
Because the number of baskets is multiplication	Its either multiplication of division because its multiple baskets  all of that	sd	5
Because that would say each orange  multiplied and turned into five oranges	So division	sd	4
So now knowing what weve just talked about here I  want you to go back and make adjustments to the work youve already done	Okay	b	1
And is it recording	Yes	b	1
What does it have to be	It has to be	sd	1
Do you want phone a friend	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	It has to be even	sd	4
Now what does my denominator have to be in order to add fractions	The same	sd	4
The same so if I understand equivalent fractions might I understand how to change the denominator so that theyre even	It either has to be equivalent or it has to like meet into each other like six and two	sd	4
But are they equivalent to each other	No	b	1
No	Oh yeah	b	4
Eric what are you doing bud	A dead marker	sd	1
I cant have you just sit there you have to ask	May I get a new marker	sd	1
So is three fourths bigger or one half	34ths	aa	4
How do you know that	Because 12 is only half of a whole and 34ths is almost a whole	sd	5
Excellent job	And 24ths is	sd	4
Alyssa I need you to let them do the talking and then when I say can you add to it Okay	Okay	b	1
I do want to know what you said	24ths would be the half	sd	4
Hunter explain the next one	Okay um	b	1
38ths or 12	I said one half because 38ths is not even half  38ths	sd	5
And Rylan do the last one please	I said 23rds because 23rds is bigger than one half	sd	5
Dear Lord Im looking right at you buddy going I know I called on someone else	after we	sd	1
So what is one four plus two fourths	34ths	aa	4
So what do I have to do add to my half to make it bigger than three fourths	Should we stand up when were done	sd	1
Sit down when youre done	Oh ok	ba	1
You guys are like shes crazy	My moms crazier	sd	1
Harmony tell me the first one a four plus two fourths equals	34ths	aa	4
And what did you put to make it bigger than that	Like what size	sd	1
Do we agree	Yeah	b	2
What its doing is its adding it and is it bigger than a half	Its the same as last	sd	4
Its the same as last	Yeah	b	2
So its the same	Oh okay	b	1
Is 28ths plus 18th  less than or greater than	Less than	sd	4
A third plus a third	Greater than	sd	4
Place of fourth piece next to an eighth piece	MsStrathom I have the things written down	sd	1
You are right I do	Yellow	sd	1
So yellow and whats in an eight	An eighth is dark blue	sd	4
Okay so pull out your red fraction circle	A yellow	sd	4
John where are your fraction circles	I dont know	sd	1
Okay go ahead explain what you did here	So the problem said to have a whole which is here in the red and to have one fourth which is black and then an eighth	sd	5
So the problem said to have a whole which is here in the red and to have one fourth which is black and then an eighth	And then it said to color the rest so I did a couple more to fill it in	sd	5
Oh you disagreeGo ahead John what do you disagree with	Well I disagree because I dont I didnt see in the problem where it said could fill the rest of it up with eighths	sd	5
Well I disagree because I dont I didnt see in the problem where it said could fill the rest of it up with eighths	So what I did is I put my fourth next to my eighth and Ive seen that it looked like a third	sd	5
So what I did is I put my fourth next to my eighth and Ive seen that it looked like a third	Because you could fit three of those in there	sd	5
Because you could fit three of those in there	So I put	sd	1
Three of your eight pieces in there	No three of them combined	sd	4
No three of them combined	Like three together	sd	4
Like three together	together	sd	2
together	It makes a third	sd	2
It makes a third	Yeah	b	2
Zach what do you think	I think that it equals a third because I put the yellow and the blue together and then a third on top and it filled in perfectly	sd	5
I think that it equals a third because I put the yellow and the blue together and then a third on top and it filled in perfectly	I think it equals 25ths because I put 25ths on top and it fit pretty good	sd	5
Does it have to fit pretty good or exact	Exact	aa	4
Okay but did it fit exactly	No	b	1
No	I think so	sv	2
Yes maam	I got 13rd too	sd	4
How could you use the fraction circles to find the sum	Um so you could so if youre adding you can put them together and see what its like see how much it is together	sd	4
What do you think Alyssa	28ths is equal to 14th	sd	4
So whats my common denominator	Eight	sd	4
You two are going to work together you too	Okay so what I think is that if I take a half and put one fourth that wouldnt correctly really fit there so if I put	sd	5
Explain to me what youre thinking	Two halves plus two fourths so um	sd	4
ask him questions	So two fourths equals a half	sd	4
So two fourths equals a half	So two fourths plus one fourth	sd	4
Were gonna start when you and your partners are done go to a 0	Three fourths	sd	4
Okay so Hunter what do we start out with	A half	sd	4
And then what did you set down	To a half	sd	4
You knew that two fourths was equivalent to a half	And then it said plus one fourth so we put the fourth one	sd	5
And then it said plus one fourth so we put the fourth one	And then we took the half out of there	sd	5
And then we took the half out of there	And then we got three fourths	sd	5
Olivia	Im sorry	sd	1
Stand up when you and your partner are done	The top is one so its two tenths	sd	4
The top is one so its two tenths	Its one fifth	sd	2
Its one fifth	Two tenths	sd	2
Two tenths	One plus one equals	sd	2
What did you not understand	I dont understand the problem because 110 is half of a fifth	sd	5
And what did you say	I said add 15	sd	4
Why am I adding 15	Because it says to add one fifth up there	sd	5
So Luke doesnt understand why its not one half	Because 15 goes into 110 goes into one fifth twice so then	sd	5
So what is my answer everyone	Three tenths	sd	4
Why three tenths	Because you have to add another 10th	sd	5
Because you have to add another 10th	Two units is equal to a tenth	sd	5
Two units is equal to a tenth	I mean a fourth is equal to a tenth and you have to add another 10th	sd	5
Where did you get it	Old Navy	sd	1
Is this making sense to both of you	Yes	b	1
I love that	We still had it	sd	1
Now add another three eighths to it	Doesnt really make sense	sd	3
No because you are right there is a much easier way to do this	Are you going to do teach us the easier way	sd	1
I need you to two thirds plus one sixth and come up with the answer	Okay	b	1
Oh so then write about a half	Add another one and make a half	sd	5
Add another one and make a half	So that would be 710	sd	5
So that would be 710	I dont have twelfths	sd	1
I dont have twelfths	I dont think I have twelfths	sd	1
I dont think I have twelfths	this is	sd	1
this is	Three tenths	sd	4
Three tenths	And then	sd	1
And then	Three tenths of	sd	4
Three tenths of	Seven tenths	sd	2
Seven tenths	Seven tenths	sd	2
Seven tenths	Okay	b	1
Okay	So whats worth one twelfth	sd	3
So whats worth one twelfth	All right	aa	1
Okay Zoe John come here	Okay	b	1
Everyone should be facing forward	First we were confused because we tried to put fourths but it didnt fill it up	sd	4
First we were confused because we tried to put fourths but it didnt fill it up	So we had to see what other piece have we had to fill it up	sd	4
Which was	One twelfth	sd	4
What did you have to get before you could go any further	We had to find the common denominator and its twelve	sd	5
We had to find the common denominator and its twelve	So now we have to turn the two sixths and one fourth into	sd	5
What is my problem again	Two fourths plus	sd	4
One fourth plus two sixths	Yes	b	1
Zach come and show them what we did	Okay	b	1
Okay	So we had one fourth and then two sixths	sd	5
So we had one fourth and then two sixths	and we figures out the common denominator is twelve	sd	5
and we figures out the common denominator is twelve	And I know that four times three	sd	5
So put your common denominator 12 over to the side like I did remember when I did I put 12 over here and drew a line and 12 over here and drew a line only because theyll be able to see the process okay	Okay we figured out that four times three is twelve so it would be times three	sd	5
Okay we figured out that four times three is twelve so it would be times three	And then we have to do the same thing to the one so we do that times three right and three times one is three	sd	5
And then we have to do the same thing to the one so we do that times three right and three times one is three	So this one is three twelfths and then six times two is 12	sd	5
So this one is three twelfths and then six times two is 12	And then I do the same thing on top which is four and then I have to add the three and the four which is seven so its seven	sd	5
And then one times three equals	Three	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
But you got this	Could be technically	sd	1
Does that make sense	I did this but we only have one fourth so can I add just one fourth	sd	4
So what is my common denominator	Twelve	sd	4
So if you laid that down there how many twelfths is it gonna take	Three	sd	4
Is it gonna take three or is it gonna take four	Oh yeah four	b	4
So now I have 312 plus 412 which is what	Seven	sd	4
So what piece did I have to use	Eighth	sd	4
Fourth isnt gonna do it	Makes no sense	sd	3
So whats my common denominator	Ten	sd	4
All right good	We got two wrong	sd	1
Im gonna make some breakout rooms during those	Mr C what survey	sd	1
Should be linked in here	Let me check real quick so Im not sure	sd	1
Right	Yeah I dont have it Mr B	sd	1
I sent it to you	All right thank you	aa	1
There you go	All right	aa	1
Its page 146	This what	sd	3
This what	This is 3 so then that will be 20 this would be equals to a 10	sd	5
How come	I just finished	sd	1
The	Wait is this Monday	sd	1
Which you would have to do on Monday	If we did it	sd	1
What does it mean to decompose fractions	Ms  what page is it	sd	1
Carrie	To make it into the little pieces	sd	4
So  give me an example for fourfifths	Onefifth four times	aa	4
whatd you do	What I did was I did onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth five times and I got fivesixths	sd	5
Yeah	I did threesixths plus twosixths	sd	4
Does that also work	Yeah	b	1
James did you do it another way	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Fivesixths equals onesixth times five	sd	5
Okay but were decomposing remember	Oh	b	1
Do we need another minute to look at that sixeighths or do we have that finished too	Finished	sd	1
Finished	I got that done	sd	1
Chloe will you decompose this for me	Yep	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I did oneeight plus oneeighth plus oneeighth plus oneeighth  all the way to eight ones	sd	5
How many of these did you have	Eight	sd	4
Eight	I mean six	sd	4
Carrie whatd you do	I did two eighths plus two eighths plus two eighths	sd	5
Diego  whatd you do	I did threeeighths plus threeeighths	sd	4
Alan whatd you do	I did threeeighths plus threeeighths	sd	4
Remember now	Yeah	b	1
Give me a thumbs up if you remember how to decompose a fraction	I havent been to school for  weeks so	sd	1
I havent been to school for  weeks so	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	It kind of sounds a little weird because when we did just adding fractions or taking away fractions	sd	1
It kind of sounds a little weird because when we did just adding fractions or taking away fractions	We have to decompose this one	sd	1
We have to decompose this one	making a new fraction	sd	1
making a new fraction	Is this a decomposing one	sd	1
Are we talking about water or glue	Water	sd	4
Is there enough water for everyone	No	b	1
What do you think we need to figure out first	How many cups of water is in one quart	sd	4
Carrie what do you think	I think you need to figure out how many water youre going to need	sv	4
How much water are we going to need	More	aa	4
More	Onefourth times nine	sd	4
Did you figure it out already	No	b	1
No	Not yet but Im still on it	sd	1
Ready	Yes	b	1
Avery what do you think	So theres nine members and theyre each getting onefourth cup of water	sd	5
So theres nine members and theyre each getting onefourth cup of water	Thats going to be ninefourths cups of water	sd	5
How did you get ninefourths cups of water	Because I just one times nine is nine	sd	5
Diego what do we get	Ninefourths but its not ninefourths because	sd	4
Look at this math thinking	Oh I thought you were mad for a second	sd	1
Oh I thought you were mad for a second	I was like Oh no	sd	1
I was like Oh no	Whatd we do	sd	1
Yeah	Theres going to be five wholes	sd	4
Plus can I get another fourfourths	Yes	b	1
What does that give me	Eightfourths	b	4
Eightfourths plus  Oh	Ninefourths	sd	4
So  what is it	Two wholes and onefourth	sd	4
Two wholes and onefourth	Two and onefourth	sd	2
We have a whole here and a whole here plus	Two and onefourth	sd	4
Okay	So two and onefourth	sd	1
So two and onefourth	Ive never seen Ms Douglas so happy	sd	1
One quart	Equals	sd	4
equals	Because theres two cups in one pint and two pints in one quart	sd	5
So  is there enough water for everyone	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yay	I didnt know that because I didnt see the homework	sd	1
I didnt know that because I didnt see the homework	Ive never seen Ms Douglas  so happy before but thats a good thing right	sd	1
Are we ready to keep going	Yes	b	1
Questions about anything we did here	No	b	1
No	That test from yesterday sucked out all my brain juice	sd	1
Thats the one we just did	No	b	1
No	It was a different question	sd	1
Baking	No	b	1
No	It was the answer	sd	1
Baking	Muffins	sd	4
Let me check	Why eggs	b	1
Were on page 232 in your math journal		b	1
What are we making	Muffins	sd	4
and  her sister are making 12 blueberry wheat muffins for breakfast	Which page is it	sd	1
Sounds delicious doesnt it	Thats a lot of ingredients	sd	1
The sisters want to do what	Triple the recipe	sd	4
If  youre tripling something how many are you making	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
They want three batches		b	4
I said What are we going to do	Triple the amount	sd	4
Triple the amount	Were going to triple the portion	sd	2
Which means were going to	Multiply	sd	4
By	Three	sd	4
Look at you guys	Is that six or six	sd	3
Okay	This is hard just because the words scramble up  your brain to thinking it is hard	sd	1
I cant see it from here	How many teaspoons of salt	sd	1
If you have an answer  I want you to stand up and do 20 jumping jacks	I am not standing up	sd	1
I am not standing up	Thats harder	sv	1
David in one recipe how much salt do they need  for one recipe	Teaspoon	sd	4
So what are we going to do to this onefourth teaspoon	Times three	sd	4
David how many teaspoons do they need for all three recipes	Onetwelfth	sd	5
Onetwelfth	If they have four three times its 12	sd	5
So whats the answer	Threefourths	sd	4
Threefourths of a teaspoon	Thats what I got	sd	2
Im going to have to erase  to scroll up	Thats all right	aa	1
Do you need this for a minute	No	b	1
No	Wait	sd	1
Wait	I dont think so	sd	1
Lets give them a minute	I finished the entire page	sd	1
I finished the entire page	Me too	sd	1
Me too	Seriously	aa	1
Seriously	Same	sd	1
Same	Some people do it really fast and sometimes we have to rush	sd	1
Thats okay	Thats an improper	sd	4
Ready	Yes	b	1
Once you think you have an answer for that youre going to do 30 jumping jacks	Oh okay	b	1
Owen	One half	sd	4
So what are we going to do to that	Either add it three  times or multiply it	sd	4
Okay and then whats my answer Diego	You get a whole and one half	sd	4
We got this right	Yes	b	1
But what is that	Improper	sd	4
Improper but	Its improper	sd	4
Winner	Winner winner chicken dinner	sd	1
Now	My pencil broke	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
All its asking is  if we were to put a number line together	All the way to	sd	1
Where would it be	I think it would be in the middle of one and two	sd	4
it lies between one and two	Ms Douglas	sd	1
Ms Douglas	So just one  and two	sd	1
So just one  and two	Im already done	sd	1
Im already done	whenever we go to fifth grade were already going to be Megamind	sd	1
I know because youre hanging out with me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	We love Ms Douglas	sd	1
We love Ms Douglas	Shes	sd	1
Are you ready	Yeah	b	1
How many  times am I going to multiply this recipe	Oh I know	aa	1
233		b	1
Now you can work with a partner as long as youre doing	Math	sd	1
Its a lot easier to think math when you have someone to think with	Ms Douglas when you said Shut it down for a second I thought something was going to happen	sd	1
Know your plan	Yeah	b	1
Lets get to work	Ms Douglas	sd	1
Owen what do you have	Twofourths	sd	4
David	Foureighths	aa	4
Foureighths	Sixtwelfths	sd	2
James	Sevenfourteenths	sd	4
Sevenfourteenths	Eighteighteenths	sd	4
Nathan	Eightsixteenths	sd	4
Ben	I had eightsixteenths	sd	4
Nathan what did you do	I just put everything into a percentage of	sd	4
So how did you figure out these fractions	Well all of them are going to be the same because just have smaller pieces	sd	5
David how did you figure it out	So I just used like one two and then	sd	4
Oh Kevin what did you get	Threeninths	sd	4
How did you get threeninths Kevin	Times three	sd	4
Julia	Onesixth	sd	4
What am I doing to three to get six	Three times two	sd	4
Twosixths thank you	Threethirds	sd	4
James	1030ths	aa	4
What did you multiple onethird by to get 1030s	10	b	4
Whatever I do to the top	Its an easy 10 multiplication	sd	4
I do to the bottom	What about threefourths	sd	4
What about what	Threefourths	sd	4
How did you get that	Times four	sd	4
Ben	I wrote quite a big number four commas in it	sd	4
Okay	Not commas	sd	1
Not commas	I dont know I dont remember what its called but I think it divides	sd	4
I dont know I dont remember what its called but I think it divides	I dont remember exactly what theyre called because	sd	3
Theyre commas	Okay I couldnt remember off the top of my head if that was right	sd	1
Okay so you did lots of commas	Yeah like four commas	sd	4
any number	No	aa	1
Multiply it use the rule whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top because pictures are not always going to work	Can it also be in the hundreds	sd	4
Miguel what did you get	200 500	b	4
What did you multiply it by	100	b	4
Fourfifths	Yeah	b	1
I started with two fifths	tenths	sd	4
Good	Twotenths	sd	4
Ella	Eight20ths	sd	4
What did you multiply by to get eight20ths	I multiplied by four	sd	4
David	20 over 50	sd	4
What did he multiply by	10	b	4
Julia	I did 10 and 25	sd	4
How much	10 and 25	sd	4
What did you multiply by	I multiplied five times five and two times five	sd	5
What did you get	400 100	b	4
Yeah you missed a zero	I did two billion five billion	sd	4
Okay so you multiplied by a billion	Yeah	b	1
David	So do you just do any number	sd	4
So whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Chloe did you have another question	No	aa	1
Greater than less than equal to	Oh I know this	sd	1
Diego what do you think	I think its onefifth	sv	4
Onefifth is what	The bigger one	sd	4
Why do you say that	onefifth is bigger	aa	4
Okay	And it uses up more space	sd	4
Penelope	Onefifth is bigger because how you said the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	sd	5
So our slices are getting	Smaller	sd	4
Ella what do you think	I think its	sv	1
I think its	Because twofifths smaller pieces	sd	5
So if we were to look at this is that more or less than half	More	aa	4
If we come over here Im only getting	You can always just go back and get more	sd	1
Chloe do you have a question	twothirds equal because if you you get three and then six	sd	5
twothirds equal because if you you get three and then six	Thats why I think theyre equal those are both the same number and equal	sd	5
Thats why I think theyre equal those are both the same number and equal	If you multiply it by six	sd	5
Are those equal	No	b	1
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Okay so yes the number of pieces we get are the same but the size of our pieces are different	Very different	sd	1
Yes thats true but look at our denominators	Theyre both the same	sd	4
Are my denominators the same or different	The same	sd	4
what do you think	I think nine10ths because	sd	4
Nine10ths because	You get nine pieces and six10ths you only get six pieces	sd	5
Are my numerators the same	No	b	1
Are my denominators the same	No	b	1
Amy what do you think	Nine10ths	sd	4
Nine10ths	Because theres more slices	sd	5
Nathan	Its almost the same because still need to cut it right there in the middle	sd	5
Its almost the same because still need to cut it right there in the middle	So nine	sd	5
Is that what I heard Nathan	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I think its twothirds just because its like numerator or denominator	sv	5
I think its twothirds just because its like numerator or denominator	It looks like its more pieces but the lower the denominator the bigger the piece gets	sd	5
It looks like its more pieces but the lower the denominator the bigger the piece gets	So I think its twothirds	sv	5
Were still just missing one slice but were missing a much smaller slice	Oh	b	1
Are you seeing that	Yeah	b	1
So if I were to think about one10th onethird which ones bigger	One10th	b	4
Are you following me	Basically whats happening is the numerator is bigger on the 10 so that means theres more pieces	sd	5
Basically whats happening is the numerator is bigger on the 10 so that means theres more pieces	So basically whats happening slice thats missing on the but youre just missing one tiny slice versus	sd	5
Julia	Onehalf	aa	4
David	Twothirds	sd	4
Audrey	Nine10ths	sd	4
Ill give you one more minute to think about this	Can I sharpen my pencil	sd	1
What do you think my smallest fraction is Kevin	The smallest fraction is onethird	sd	4
Lydia what do you think	Onesixth	sd	4
Penelope	One10th	b	4
One10th why is that my smallest fraction	Because the bigger the pieces the smaller the number	sd	5
Chloe what was next	Onesixth	sd	4
And whats my largest one	Onethird	aa	4
All right Mila what order did you put these fractions in	One10ths three10ths seven10ths	sd	4
Julia	I think its wrong because theyre all the same denominator I think that seven10ths is the biggest because one10th is still a really small piece still is three seven is the biggest one	sv	5
What do you think	Six13	sd	4
Six13ths because my bigger denominator means	Smaller pieces	sd	4
Nathan what do you think	It would be six10ths	sd	4
I get six pieces no matter which way we look at it here youre getting six out of 13 thats pretty small pieces right	Yeah	b	1
It might be worth it to rewrite the fraction so that you can focus just on the fractions and then decide which one is your correct answer	Yes	b	1
Yes	A piece of a whole	sd	4
A piece of a whole	I heard decomposing yesterday in the test that we took	sd	4
I heard decomposing yesterday in the test that we took	I think it means when you have to add and subtract	sd	4
I think it means when you have to add and subtract	I heard decomposing that once That it means throwing something away	sd	4
I heard decomposing that once That it means throwing something away	I think decomposing means putting into parts	sd	4
I think decomposing means putting into parts	Ive heard	sd	1
Ive heard	Ive heard decomposing in gardening	sd	4
Ive heard decomposing in gardening	It means to break down	sd	4
It means to break down	Should we write that	sd	1
Should we write that	I watch some  and some of them Theres a girl camp and a boy camp so they break it up	sd	4
I watch some  and some of them Theres a girl camp and a boy camp so they break it up	Decomposers	sd	4
Decomposers	Do we have to write that	sd	1
Do we have to write that	Yes	b	1
Yes	A plus or a minus  and a product	sd	4
A plus or a minus  and a product	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	1
Yes	Our first fraction would be 44	sd	4
Our first fraction would be 44	Because thats the whole then I did take away 14	sd	5
Because thats the whole then I did take away 14	and I got 34	sd	4
and I got 34	Yes	b	2
Yes	44  14 and the Whats the bottom number called	sd	3
44  14 and the Whats the bottom number called	Denominator	aa	4
Denominator	You wouldnt subtract the denominator only the numerator	sd	1
You wouldnt subtract the denominator only the numerator	Yes	b	1
Yes	Because theyre four pieces	sd	5
Because theyre four pieces	You would only take out one piece	sd	4
You would only take out one piece	34	b	4

Because you only add the denominators not the numerators	Because it will be a different fraction	sd	5
Because it will be a different fraction	Because you cant change the denominator	sd	5
Because you cant change the denominator	Because the fraction  because it probably wouldnt be the right answer	sd	5

Good morning class	Hi	b	1
What is this trying to get across to you	That in 1999 there was a house price like the price	sd	4
Say something intelligent  about this	I said  The houses in 1999 were made way more expensive	sd	4
All right what increased	The average house price	sd	4
The average house price	2000	b	2
2000	Yes it increased by 2000	sd	2
Yes it increased by 2000	And average price by 10000	sd	4
And average price by 10000	It increased a lot	sd	2
All right tell me something intelligent about this	In 1999 it was	sd	4
Is there anything wrong with this	Does that say 80000	sd	4
Is there anything misleading about it	By 2000	sd	4
By 2000	Yes	b	1
Yes	Wait	sd	1
All right tell me something about this	It shows the average increase in the house prices No sorry	sd	4
It shows the average increase in the house prices No sorry	It shows the increase of the average house pricing from 1998 to 1999	sd	4
Is there anything misleading or weird about this graph	Yes	b	1
What	increase	sd	4
It looks like it right	Yes theres a gap	sd	4
Mr Strathom Actually I dont talk about	Yes well we picked	sd	1
I cant try to talk you into  Its better just to  Remember you can do this really easy by just putting in L1	Well yes	b	1
Well yes	I could do that too	sd	1
Im going to do this too	Am I doing this right	sd	1
Am I doing this right	Standard deviation	sd	4
Whats happening	Everything was the same	sd	4
What happened from original to  in general the	So is  40	sd	4
Tell me what happened	Theyre the same	sd	4
What happened with the measures of center	S	sd	1
By what	10	b	4
What happened with the measures of spread	They were the same	sd	4
What happened to the measures of center when I gave everybody 10 extra points	They raised	sd	4
By	10	b	4
The goal is could you have predicted this without putting it into your calculator based on the story	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
What did I basically do to everybodys data	Increase 10 points	sd	4
What was the range	30	b	4
What was the IQR	20	b	4
What was the standard deviation	104	b	4
Now when I gave everybody or they retook the test and everybody did 10 points better what happened to the range	It was 30	sd	4
What happened to the IQR	20	b	4
What happened is the standard deviation	104	b	4
Can I summarize what you said	Go ahead	aa	1
Did my hands get further apart	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Did I increase the spread	No	b	1
What do your measures of spread do	Stay the same	sd	4
See if you come to those conclusions	Do the mean	sd	4
Itll be slightly different so make sure youre actually calculating it and looking at the numbers	Whats the mean	sd	3
The median went from 355 to	71	b	4
When they doubled their scores ladies When they doubled their scores ladies when they doubled their scores did the mean of their data double	Yes	b	1
Those all did this but did these do that	No	b	1
They went like this	They did not move	sd	4
Did they spread out	No	b	1
Did they move up	Yes	b	1
Yes	In my experience of looking at these two charts the first one where you add up the range the standard deviation didnt change but the range	sd	4
Everybody got how many extra credit points	10	b	4
They went up by	10	b	4
If you took a quiz and you all got 10 on it and I tripled your score youd all get what	30	b	4
30 and the spread would also get multiplied by three but in that case I guess if you all got 10 our spread would be zero	we did very good	sd	1
Youre ready	No	b	1
Why are we talking in accents	I dont know	sd	1
Here we go	Wait	sd	1
People who know how numbers work	Marketing	sd	4
What did he say	Cars	sd	4
If youre ever going to buy a car	Im buying a car	sd	1
If youre ever going to buy a car and they tell you how much its going to cost you per month and you take their first offer youre getting totally messed over	Negotiate	sd	1
In 1999 what did it go up to	8200000	b	4
If you were making 80000 a year and you got a raise to 82000 a year	I quit	sd	1
I quit	8200000	b	1
What does this graph make you think happened to the home prices	It has increased a lot	sd	4
Did the home prices really triple	No	b	1
Is there an increase in tuition	Yes	b	1
What happened to how much it costs to go to college	Increased	sd	4
Did it increase	Yes	b	1
If you went from about 16500 to about 18200 is that really times two	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
At a glance what does it look like the wages of the fast food restaurant did	They increased	sd	4
Yes	supposed to go up by 2 but has only gone up by 1	sd	4
Can you do that	No	b	1
Theyre trying to make you think again	9	b	4
Is that going to make you rich	No	b	1
I want to hear you guys find the flaw	Thats a big increase	sd	4
Theres something a little bit different and subtly different about this one	It goes 2 4 6 18	sd	5
Thats not a problem	Its not equal	sd	4
These count by what	10s	b	4
Can you do that	No	b	1
Ill tell you when you guys get to math four in calculus youll learn that it is legal to do that as long as you tell people that its logarithmic	What is that	sd	3
In math one if somebody gives you that graph theyre lying to you and you cant	Cant do that	sd	4
Is this thing a linear decrease	No	b	1
These are the ways we just  people can lie to you with graphs	Missing a	aa	1
These are both due on Friday so you can work on them in any order	I quit	sd	1
You can only be fired and I	You dont pay me enough	sd	1
What does a high school graduate make compared to a nonhigh school graduate over their course of their lifetime	15 bucks	sd	4
15 bucks	High school doesnt matter	sd	1
Dont skip that equation part	Why did we do that	sd	3
Ella what did  we draw	I drew three circles to do for the vases	sd	4
Okay	Its doing the thing again Miss	sd	1
It was doing that yesterday  Why	Internet	sd	1
He doesnt need to	Miss me and my mom tried making  crumble cookies and they were good but not the same	sd	1
Miss me and my mom tried making  crumble cookies and they were good but not the same	I got crumble cookies but I wasnt at my house I was at a friends birthday party	sd	1
Three circles	Three circles for the vases and I put four dots for the flowers	sd	4
So each circle had four dots to represent	The flowers	sd	4
Did anybody have something similar or different	I got  something different	sd	2
Carrie did you do something different than Ella	I actually drew flowers and a vase	sd	4
What kind of an equation did you come up with David	4x312	b	5
Miguel what do you think	The second one is wrong	sd	2
Why is it wrong	8x4 is actually 32	sd	5
Julia what do you think	He didnt really have to do that because  its telling you its groups of flowers	sd	5
He didnt really have to do that because  its telling you its groups of flowers	Its three multiple of four	sd	5
Carrie	I think  bottom ones a little bit off because they didnt really have those numbers on he paper so  I dont think you should use multiple	sd	5
What made it so easy	Just drawing it	sd	4
Ella	What helped me is the drawing and how I know what 4x3 is	sd	4
James	I think it was so easy because its a bit basic its like third grade math	sd	4
You too	I didnt know that you could add soda to flowers	sd	1
Is there another equation we can use	4x3	b	4
Uhuh	2x6	b	4
Uhuh  Carrie	Im thinking you could divide something	sd	4
Im thinking you could divide something	There is an  option in it	sd	4
Is that the same	Yeah	b	1
Does this represent the soda that were adding	Yes	b	1
Do you agree with Diegos drawing here	Yeah	b	1
Julia	I did one fourth cup one fourth one fourth	sd	5
I did one fourth cup one fourth one fourth	And it equals three fourths	sd	5
Anybody have another equation Carrie	I did 14 x 3	sd	4
And what did you get for  an answer	34	b	4
Is our process similar to what we were doing when we were thinking about the flowers in the vase	Yes	b	1
Do we know how to multiply a fraction number	I thought it was different when you asked the question something looked off like it wasnt right	sd	4
I thought it was different when you asked the question something looked off like it wasnt right	But then when you wrote it down you had a similar to what the question was asking so I couldnt really understand what it was	sd	4
So we took that piece of multiplying whole numbers the flowers and the vase remembered what we knew about multiplication and thats going to help you with solving these problems	I have a question	sd	3
Yeah	What if the common denominator	sd	1
Whats a bunch	Probably a dozen or more	sd	4
Florist has five bunches does it matter how many flowers are in each bunch	No	b	1
How many cups of water does the florist need		b	4
Diego how much water do we need	Five  cups of water	sd	4
Julia what do you think	Well because this was a fraction I did 38 x 5	sd	5
What did you get		b	4
	But the problem is that that doesnt what do you call  it	sv	3
What do you call it	Where the bottom	sd	3
Did you do it then what did you get	I got five cups	sd	4
Matteo	I raised my hand for the 158 cups of water	sd	4
Okay	What I think	sv	1
No did you get a different answer	No	b	2
How much water is going into each vase	One cup	sd	4
One cup here one cup here Whats my equation	I dont know	sd	3
Chloe whats my equation	So my picture didnt look exactly like that but I thought that by the picture each one  has five and each have one cup	sd	5
So my picture didnt look exactly like that but I thought that by the picture each one  has five and each have one cup	So I thought maybe divide by five	sd	5
Matteo	5 x 38	sd	4
How much water is she putting in each one	One cup	sd	4
What did you and Ella talk about	What we talked about is	sd	1
Nobodys showing me then we dont need any time	Wait	sd	1
Where in our information does it talk about food coloring	At the end	sd	4
What does it say Ben	It says and three teaspoons of food coloring	sd	4
Thats the piece we need	We talked too much about water and now	sd	4
How much does she put in vase one	38	b	4
How much does she put in vase two	38	b	4
In vase three	38	b	4
Four	38	b	4
38	38	b	4
Youre understanding what she did right	Yes	b	1
James	Well we can probably use five function so 5 x 38	sd	4
She did 38 five times	I got it right	sd	1
Is there another equation she could use William	I got it right on the first equation	sd	1
Because we know that multiplication is what	Repeated addition	sd	4
So this is a whole	All the math at like	sd	1
All the math at like	So what I did is both problems and then	sd	1
So what I did is both problems and then	Because I knew it wouldnt just be two numbers by itself and	sd	4
So now Has anybody ever made	I have	sd	1
You following me	Yes	b	1
Caleb	I think it would be 23  5	sv	4
I took three teaspoons and another three teaspoons	Oh  33	b	4
So how many teaspoons did she used	That was easy	sd	1
Look at 224	I  told you	aa	1
So youre going to finish out what do you have four problems left because we did one together	Yeah four	b	1
Kayla what do we do if we disagree on a problem	redo it	sd	4
Clay do you have yours	Yes	b	1
You may begin	In A I got 67 then for B I got 11 then for C I got 106 then for D I got 96 then for E I got 210 then I got 31 step 2	sd	5
In A I got 67 then for B I got 11 then for C I got 106 then for D I got 96 then for E I got 210 then I got 31 step 2	My sister got 7 and then 10 and 5 and 7 and then 1	sd	2
My sister got 7 and then 10 and 5 and 7 and then 1	Then I got 7 and 4 and 8 and 6 and 8	sd	2

Were going to end up with	A negative number	sd	4
When youre done with the math boxes	Which ones are we going to do	sd	1
Which ones are we going to do	One three four and five	sd	1
Today I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid and we have been working with coordinate grids havent we	Yes	b	1
What rule	That you had to discover the x	sd	4
What way did that go	No vertical	sd	4
Because horizontal is	Up and down	sd	4
Georgia can you add to that please	This ones more wider to the one  bigger than that one	sd	2
Our coordinate grid spread it	Wider	sd	4
Which made the top go	Smaller	sd	4
It expanded vertically and it shrunk	Horizontally	sd	4
We are going to move right to the math message	What about mental math and fluency	sd	1
What does this say	Original sailboat	sd	4
Where do you think youre going to draw the math message or plot the math message	The original sailboat	sd	4
What are these called	Coordinates	sd	4
Youre going to need to move your desk in here so that you can see I dont want you to  Move your desk right over here so that you can see	be about you	sd	1
It keeps going off is what the problem is	What is that	sd	1
It is a study that were doing for the University of Colorado but the thing keeps going off and I dont understand why	Is it not charging	sd	1
I dont know well its just going to move forward and do it	No but they already have one in grid one	sd	4
Youre doing those coordinates up there on	Can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Missy	614000	b	1
Kayla	61400	b	4
Why wouldnt that open	Did you double click it	sd	1
Next question	What	ba	1
What	Its not possible	sd	1
The whole number is the number on the left first number to the ones place	I know but why is it called Well why is it six	sd	3
Can somebody explain why it would just be six	Because its five more and you increase its four butbecause	sd	5
This is six	On the digit after the value to the right	sd	4
You look at the place value to the right	That is if its five more you bring to a four but if its four or resting then	sv	4
Let it rest	Yes	b	1
Yes	I still dont know how it works	sd	3
What	Im still confused	sd	3
This is how we do it	I understand that	sd	1
Tricky huh	Yes	b	1
Six and what	1400	b	4
Zoey will you read that number for me	5000	b	1
5000	50086	b	1
Franc what was your answer and why did you get that	Well I got the answer one	sd	4
Well I got the answer one	I looked at the whole number and I looked into those	sd	4
Right	Right	b	1
Right	If its five or more you raise the score and it was five	sd	5
If its five or more you raise the score and it was five	I knew the root to do that one	sd	5
The answers yes	No	b	1
The answer is no	The answer is 0059	sd	1
0059 and how did you know	I looked at the hundredths place and then I looked to the right of it	sd	5
I looked at the hundredths place and then I looked to the right of it	Since six is higher than five so I rounded the	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Finn will you read that number for me	39987	b	1
Asher tell me	That would be 40	sd	4
How do you know	I know because if you look at the 910  right then youll see that its a 8 and requires	sd	5
Does that make sense	No Im confused	sd	3
399 or whats the next tenth up	40	b	4
Now does it make sense	Yes	b	1
Nessa you want to read it	Sure	b	1
Sure	Learning intention I can use area models to understand and applying algorithm for a fraction and multiplication algorithm	sd	1
Thats spelled wrong	Stepbystep in prepping for doing something such as learning the computation in solving this problem	sd	1
We have talked about algorithms many times before right	Yes	b	1
Ellie will you read that for us please	I know I can manage to do it when I successful used the algorithm to multiply the fraction in problem two through seven page 179	sd	1
I know I can manage to do it when I successful used the algorithm to multiply the fraction in problem two through seven page 179	Also I can explain how the area models of one of my answers was correct	sd	1
Theres one two three four	14	b	4
Yes 14	24 34	b	4
One two three four five six	16 26 36 46 56	b	4
You want me to shade it for you	Yes	b	1
What is double shaded Zoey	The third shade is  26	sd	4
The third shade is  26	Thats the bottom though the 26	sd	2
Whats a denominator Linda	24	b	4
Got it	Got it	sd	1
Yes youre doing it in your so I think you have to be more independent	What	ba	1
Do you have a pencil	I know	aa	1
Mariah what was the first thing that you did	I shaded	sd	4
Do you want to show your work	This one is at four maybe we should put it on that side a little bit	sd	1
This one is at four maybe we should put it on that side a little bit	Ill start with this	sv	1
Ill start with this	First I drew my box then I labeled my fourths I labeled my thirds	sd	5
First I drew my box then I labeled my fourths I labeled my thirds	I did my one two three groups and then one two three four	sd	5
I did my one two three groups and then one two three four	I did four of	sd	1
I did four of	I put them	sd	1
Thats fine	I did my fourths right here	sd	5
I did my fourths right here	I shaded in the whole thing	sd	5
First you shaded what	I shaded in the whole box right here and then I did 33 and I took out that	sd	5
33	34	b	4
34	I took out 23 and 34 and then times by the line and then to make it	sd	5
I took out 23 and 34 and then times by the line and then to make it	Then I became easy and I shaded it all and then I double shaded this part	sd	5
Any questions for Mariah	I dont think so	sd	1
Nessa do you have a question for her	Yes how did the denominator	sd	3
Yes how did the denominator	We had to multiply you need to get the answer	sd	5
We had to multiply you need to get the answer	I did 34  23  612 because 3  2  6 and 4  3  12	sd	5
Does her picture prove that 34  23 are 612	No because  isnt shaded twelves it shows two parts	sd	2
This is the same as 3  2 over 4  3 to get 612 right	I didnt	sd	1
Im going to go to the next Lets see if I can find it in the last one	Thats the same	sd	1
Thats the same what	That same one	sd	1
Using that work	I have absolutely no idea	sd	1
First I would Marco	You would divide the square into thirds and then this	sd	4
Then	You would add on this drawing	sd	4
In the opposite direction so then youd have thirds in one direction and fifths in the other right Marco	Yes	b	1
Then what	Then you figure out what fractions are those	sv	5
Then you figure out what fractions are those	In this case it will be fifteenths	sd	5
Then you put that in	Yes	b	1
Thirds this way and Id label it	Yes	b	1
What did you say fifths the other direction	Yes	b	1
Then	You multiply 3  5 and that would equal 15 so its fifteenths	sd	5
What do I shade	You find the tick mark for 13 then you share the square right there and you use it	sv	5
You find the tick mark for 13 then you share the square right there and you use it	Then you find the 23 or 35 then you shade all of it between 13 and 35	sd	5
Touch your shoulder partner dont do anything and just explain what you think the answer is and why	10	b	4
10 and how do you know	Because I know that 5  2 is 10 for the numerator	sd	5
Because I know that 5  2 is 10 for the numerator	Then from  the numerator times the numerator	sd	5
Sarah	30 because 6  5 is 30	sd	5
Joseph total number of parts is what part of the answer	The denominator	sd	4
Was the answer more or less than each of the factors	Less	sd	4
Okay so here we started out Audrey with two thirds right	Yes	b	1
What ever were we doing	Multiplication wrestling	sd	4
Okay what is multiplication wrestling	Its when you take two numbers andtwo numbers that have two digits	sd	4
Okay	and you put on the 10s on the ones and then the 10 wrestles all the other numbers and the one wrestles	sd	4
What are we actually doing	Were putting two numbers like the one thats going to wrestle the other ones like	sd	4
What are we doing	Multiplying	sd	4
Whats a product	Two factors	sd	4
Right whats a product	The answer	sd	4
David	Like some of it	sd	4
So if I give you this 35 times 62 could you find an answer to this	Yes	b	1
Do you have the tools now to find an answer to this	Yes	b	1
Penelope what would I do first	Separate the 30 from the five and put 30	sd	4
Nathan	Pull them apart 60 and two	sd	4
Nathan do you think you know	Um yeah	b	1
Okay	I think that its you said they was wrestling it would wrestle the 30 maybe might wrestle the 60	sd	4
But how do I know how many wrestling matches Im going to make	Because youre going to wrestle 30 and 6 30 is going to wrestle 60 so thats one	sd	5
Or I did this quickly so Im not surprised you dont remember but how many digits do I have here	Two times two	sd	2
Do you remember that little piece now	Yes	b	1
Nathan you think you know my first combination	30 and 60	sd	4
Jacob	30 times two	sd	4
Louise	We can add three times six and then when you get the answer to three times six you add two zero because	sd	5
Okay so what is three times six		b	4
Whats three times two		b	4
So whos next	The fives	sd	4
Whos the five going to wrestle with	The two	sd	4
All done	I already did the whole thing	sd	1
Whats five times six		b	4
Whats five times two		b	4
		b	2
Now what do we do	Add them all in total	sd	4
Add them all in total	Youre forgetting something	sd	2
Youre forgetting something	Zero	sd	4
What am I forgetting	at the end of 60	sd	4
What	Zero at the end of 60 you didnt wait oh	sd	4
Zero at the end of 60 you didnt wait oh	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Sorry	b	1
Am I good	Yeah	b	1
Okay	I am my brain	sd	1
It feels like a Monday doesnt it James	Yeah it feels like a Friday	sd	1
Okay are we ready	Tomorrows Friday	aa	1
So were going to add zero zero zero zero give me zero	Zero	sd	1
Six plus one is	Seven	sd	4
Seven		b	2
Eight and three		b	4
2170 is what I got	I got it right	sd	1
Did we find the answer to a multiplication problem	Yes	b	1
All right how far did you get	I got like the first step	sd	4
Okay what was the first step the first thing you did	I split up 27 and 95	sd	4
What did you break 27 up to look like	20 and seven	sd	4
And 95	90 and five	sd	4
Penelope	So I did two times two	sd	4
Now what	Two times nine	sd	4
You did what	Two times nine	sd	4
Jacob help her out	20 times 90	sd	4
Okay so we did 20 times 90 what would be our next combination	20 times five	sd	4
Jacob	Seven times 90	sd	4
Okay next	Seven times five	sd	4
Everybody caught up	Hey Miss Im seeing that only 20 and seven are wrestling	sd	4
So theyre never going to wrestle each other you dont want to take out your teammate	No theyre only wrestling 90 and five but 90 and 95 are not wrestling to make seven	sd	4
All right are you ready	Yes	b	1
Two times nine is		b	4
Whats two times five		b	4
Whats seven times nine	Seven times nine 63	sd	4
And seven times five		b	4
Now what	Add them together	sd	4
Eight plus one is nine plus six is		b	4
15 and one plus one is		b	2
	Yes	b	1
Okay now if you werent able to get all the way through by yourselves is it because you forgot what you were doing or you ran out of time	Ran out of time	sd	1
Do you want a tough one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes please	sd	1
Something tricky	86 and 46	sd	4
See how far you can go	Oh my gosh	sd	1
Am I right	Yeah	b	1
Because you dont know	The answer	sd	4
If you knew your basic facts this would be real easy right	Yeah	b	1
David whats the first combination you did		b	4
Times what	I had the zeros and I put eight times nine	sd	4
I had the zeros and I put eight times nine	Im so confused	sd	3
Im so confused	No that was wrong	sd	4
No that was wrong	I did eight times four	sd	4
So we have the 80 times 40 and then what do we have	80 times nine	sd	4
80 times nine	And then six times 30 40	sd	4
And then six times 30 40	six times nine	sd	4
Whats eight times four		b	4
	No its 30	sd	2
No its 30	Damn it	sd	1
With how many zeros	I got the answer	sd	1
Whats eight times nine		b	4
Six times four		b	4
		b	2
With	Zero	sd	4
Zero	Zero	sd	4
And whats six times nine		b	4
Zero zero zero four	Its	sd	1
Four plus five is nine then 11 seven eight nine 10 11 12 4214	Yes	b	1
Did anybody else get there	Yes I got it	sd	1
You got it	Yeah	b	1
You got it Nathan	I did got it right	sd	1
Lets do one more	One more	sd	1
Are you ready	By ourselves with this	sd	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Okay	So its not that hard this one	sd	1
So its not that hard this one	Oh this ones easy	sd	1
Oh this ones easy	This ones easy	sd	1
This ones easy	This ones easy	sd	1
This ones easy	I dont even have to count	sd	1
Bless you	Thank you	aa	1
Show me on your fingers how many minutes do you need	Like	sd	1
Ready	No	b	1
No	Yep	b	1
Geo whats the first thing we do bud	Split them up in two	sd	4
For 15 Geo what did you what were your two players	Sorry for the interruption if you have not done the  please do so now	sd	1
Sorry for the interruption if you have not done the  please do so now	Thank you	aa	1
What does 24 get split up into	20 and four	sd	4
Penelope	Give them horns	sd	4
Jacob	10 times 20	sd	4
Okay	10 times four	sd	4
Okay	Five times 20	sd	4
And my very last one Stella	Five times 40	sd	4
Good right	Could I say the answer	sd	1
How many zeros	Two two two two	sd	2
Two two two two		b	4
Whats 10 times four		b	4
		b	2
Five times 20		b	4
		b	2
Five times two is 10 with another zero gives me		b	4
And five times four		b	2
	One two three four five six seven look its a 360	sd	4
	Yeah like the angel	sd	1
Yeah like the angel	360	b	1
Why Chloe	Because I think I messed up on the	sd	4
Tell me loud Chloe	I	b	1
I	I think I did most of it right but the thing got stuck on is 10 times the number but 10 times plus five plus 90	sd	4
So you know the process you messed up on the multiplication	Yeah and then I did five times 25 one four one times four and one times 20	sd	5
Okay I want you to take out your multiplication chart	Its already out	sd	1
One stick of clay shared by four people one watermelon shared by 12 people	So are we	sd	1
Explain how you did it and why you did what you did	One fruit bar shared by three people	sd	1
One fruit bar shared by three people	I said one third because theres one fruit bar and theyre dividing it between three people	sd	5
Okay Layla do number two	I said four fourths but I think its one fourth because each person would get one	sd	5
What made you think four fourths	Because theyre dividing into four and each persons taking one so its four fourths	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Remember who can tell me what our daily affirmation was this morningWhat was it	To wait is daily affirmation the message on the	sd	1
Yeah on the morning thing in the corner	To write like	sd	1
No no go ahead Elijah	Making mistakes helped me learn	sd	4
And then Connor what did you do for number three buddy	I got 112	sd	4
You got Im sorry what	112	b	4
Okay and why did you do 112 kiddo	Because each person gets 112 of the watermelon	sd	5
Okay Ben what did you do for three containers of paint shared by 10 people	What I did is I took the denominator of 10 and the numerator of 3 because they have three cans of paint and 10 people	sd	5
I have three containers of paint shared by 10 people	I did three thirds	sd	4
Because where why would I use three as my numerator and my denominator	I dont know	sd	3
Tom would you or Ben would you explain that again to me please	I put ten as the denominator because there were ten people and three as the numerator because there were three containers of paint	sd	5
What did he do	He said he used ten as the denominator	sd	2
He said he used ten as the denominator	Because there were ten people and three cans of paint	sd	5
Tell me what you did for the second one	Okay so what I did for the second one was I did two ninths because theres two containers as the numerator and then I said ninths	sd	5
Okay so what I did for the second one was I did two ninths because theres two containers as the numerator and then I said ninths	Nine people as the denominator and I got two ninths	sd	5
Harper what did you do for the third one	I used eight as my denominator because theres	sd	4
Why is it blank	Cause I erased it	sd	1
Explain what you did sir	I used eight as my denominator because theres eight people	sd	5
I used eight as my denominator because theres eight people	I used six as my numerator because six apples	sd	5
Once youve got it stand up	That should be a famous quote	sd	1
It should be a famous quote	Take a breath dude	sd	1
Oh here you go like really open your eyes	My eyes are always open	sd	1
So what would three halves be do you think	The same place as Landon said	sd	2
Because three halves is really	One and a half	sd	4
Yeah like about right there	Yes	b	2
Could you step up in friends	Can we put our whiteboards away	sd	1
Um I think you can put your whiteboards away	What about math journals	sd	1
Youre gonna need your math journals	Okay	b	1
We are only doing A Divide this number line to show thirds	You had to click the pencil	sd	1
I did	Do it on the right	sd	1
Do it on the right	Like not	sd	1
Im gonna give everybody a few more seconds	So only number one	sd	1
Bring your sheet	On the left	sd	1
What would my zero be	Zero	sd	4
Zero	Zero three	sd	4
Now what would that one be	That would be one	sd	4
Go ahead	Thats one	sd	4
Or what would it be in a fraction	Zero thirds	sd	4
Excellent job	It would be four	sd	4
Notice that I made him start with zero thirds	Are we supposed to leave all those on our papers	sd	1
Then two thirds then three thirds or a whole then four thirds which is one and a third and five thirds which is one and two thirds and six thirds which is	Two wholes	sd	2
So now	And then hit yes	sd	1
It will be easier	Can we pass one	sd	1
And it should be writing thin	Its much easier too if you divide it into thirds	sd	5
Its much easier too if you divide it into thirds	And then divided each one into half	sd	5
Or not Nate Tom would you come and label those	Is it six	sd	4
Penelope did I give you yours	Yeah	b	1
Everybody	Gary	sd	4
Be ready to share in 54321 go	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I know a number line because how so	sd	1
Go ahead	Put a one	sd	4
Put a one	And then another way is	sd	1
Why would I put two	A one and a two	sd	4
Does the question make sense	Yes	b	1
Elijah tell us what you think	So what you can do is you can put the two number lines right up next to each other	sd	5
So what you can do is you can put the two number lines right up next to each other	And you can see that the the Gary one on top the dot is further along which means that if you ran further	sd	5
Abby	But what I could add is like when you Yeah like its like you can see	sd	1
Can you talk about the fraction pieces the size	Yes	b	1
Yes	So on the top one Gary ran one and two thirds	sd	5
So on the top one Gary ran one and two thirds	And you can see that because theres the one and then its two thirds over	sd	5
And you can see that because theres the one and then its two thirds over	And then Lenna ran seven sixths because you can see the one and then theres one more six	sd	5
And what is it closer to	The one	sd	4
Its closer to the whole isnt it	Yeah	b	1
When youve got those done please stand up	Just problem four	sd	1
Go	I was I said Dans because I said I know Dans is  because I know Rachels is one whole and one half	sd	5
I was I said Dans because I said I know Dans is  because I know Rachels is one whole and one half	That would be right here and here	sd	5
That would be right here and here	But Dans is two and a half	sd	5
But Dans is two and a half	Because theres a whole right here	sd	5
Because theres a whole right here	And then theres a whole right here but it goes off the number line so that I know that theres one more	sd	5
And then theres a whole right here but it goes off the number line so that I know that theres one more	So that would be a half	sd	5
So that would be a half	Yeah	b	2
Struggling	No I got it	sd	1
How do you know	It looks like we both have that Dans is taller	sd	2
Explain to me why Dans is taller	Because Dans is Rachels plant is one and one fourth	sd	5
Where should I put a dot	Where the five fourths is	sd	4
Okay am I talking about Rachel or am I talking about Dan	Rachel	aa	4
Is this correct	Yes	b	1
William explain to me where Im going to put Dan	Dan is five fourths	sd	4
Miranda	Double	sd	4
Priscilla	Xaxis and yaxis	sd	4
Say it nice and loud	Coordinate grid	sd	4
Coordinate grid	Should we just say specific words that we should use in our description	sd	1
Katalina	Coordinate	sd	4
Coordinates yes	Is it  to say the xaxis	sd	4
Xaxis Im going to say ordered pairs	I know its already on there but it says  to make the first number bigger	sd	4
I know its already on there but it says  to make the first number bigger	So do you make the first number bigger then the xaxis will be a big part in that	sd	4
Ethan	I dont know	sd	3
What	Extrapolate	sd	4
Extrapolate	Yeah	b	1
Priscilla	Origin	b	4
What	On page 31	sd	1
Yep	Be specific in your description	sd	1
Cece	Use a ruler to write the coordinates for the new trapezoid	sd	1
Im on page 42 Ethan	Plot the new coordinates on the grid below	sd	1
Plot the new coordinates on the grid below	Connect the points in the same order you plot them	sd	1
Rylee	Does the new trapezoid look the way you expect it	sd	1
Does the new trapezoid look the way you expect it	Why or why not	sd	1
Why or why not	Be specific about how it changed	sd	1
Only the X Emanual	Another way of thinking it	sd	1
Another way of thinking it	I said it would move to the left and get a little wider	sd	4
To the left	Yes because youre doubling the Xaxis so its just going to move it to the left and make it a little wider	sd	5
To the left or to the right	To the left	sd	4
To the left	It starts out on the right side	sd	5
It starts out on the right side	And doubling it would make it go this way	sd	5
Amarilla where did you see areas of improvement in your own work	In my own work I noticed I could have used a lot more	sd	4
In my own work I noticed I could have used a lot more	But now looking back it doesnt really make sense	sd	4
But now looking back it doesnt really make sense	But now looking on the board and whats up there I noticed that I couldve done better with the vocabulary that I used	sd	4
Ethan what did Amarilla say	Amarilla said that when she was looking at her compared to the example one she said that hers didnt have as much vocabulary	sd	2
Amarilla said that when she was looking at her compared to the example one she said that hers didnt have as much vocabulary	And that she shouldve added more vocabulary	sd	2
What was your mistake	I thought we had to multiply both the Ycoordinates and the Xcoordinates	sd	4
I thought we had to multiply both the Ycoordinates and the Xcoordinates	So when I made that mistake	sd	4
The new books ordered pairs based on your rule you created	How many times larger does it want	sd	3
So this reminds you of what	Im sorry what did I miss	sd	1
Ethan	so we can basically do the same thing as the math journal one	sd	1
Lucy whats a number sentence	A number sentence is like were going to add numbers like 60 plus 2 and then we can put that as a number sentence to say that it will  to make it happen	sd	4
Walker	A number sentence is when you add more than two numbers	sd	4
Sounds good but let me ask this does it have to be addition	No	b	1
Miss Nina what is a number sentence to you	A number sentence to me is an equation of multiple digits to make a new number	sd	4
It can be fractions	Yes	b	1
Number Sentence	I think a number sentence is like when you put addition subtraction or stuff like that and putting it into a sentence with like	sd	4
What does it say Ashley	I am a dog	sd	1
Is that a sentence	Yes	b	1
Is that a sentence I am a dog	Yes	b	1
Mr Charles what do we need	We need a subject	sd	4
We need a subject	Some type of punctuation to end it and a beginning	sd	4
Corbin	Predicate	sd	4
Leia	Dog or I	sd	4
I or dog	You	aa	4
Everybody	Dog	aa	4
Now its also pointed out that we need a capital do we have one	Yes	b	1
And punctuation do we have a form of punctuation	Yes	b	1
Do I have a complete sentence on the board	No	b	1
Why do you think thats not a complete sentence	Because the r is not capital	sd	5
Is there a period	Yes	b	1
What do you think Tanner do I have my complete sentence now	No	b	1
Would that be a complete sentence	Yes	b	1
Have I written a number sentence on the board	No	b	1
What have I written on the board	Plus plus	sd	1
Why not	You dont have an answer	sd	5
It could have been my dog was running home yesterday	It could have been anything	sd	4
Do I now have a complete sentence	Yes	b	1
Talk as your table do I have a complete sentence on the board	Yes	b	1
Tell me why or why not	He doesnt have	sd	1
Why do you think its a complete sentence	Something was running home	sd	5
Something was running home	Its usually not	sd	1
Why do you think that is a complete sentence	Because without an answer its not wholly complete	sd	5
But is that the right answer to complete that sentence	No	b	1
Do you think its a complete sentence	Wrong answer	sd	4
Ashley why do you think its a complete sentence	I think its a complete sentence because you put a number which is incorrect	sd	5
I think its a complete sentence because you put a number which is incorrect	So an incorrect answer	sd	5
If I hear you right what youre saying is its a complete sentence its just an incorrect complete sentence	What	ba	1
Blake read me that sentence out loud please	I flew like a fish	sd	1
Is that a complete sentence	Yes	b	1
Is it a good sentence	No	b	1
Even though it is a complete sentence does it make sense the way its written	No	b	1
No	I flew like a bird	sd	1

What would I have to put with that red trapezoid to make one whole Diana	Another trapezoid	sd	4
Everybody agree	Yes	b	2
Please finish your number sentence	Thank you	aa	1
Yes have we completed it	Is a trapezoid	sd	4
Is that a complete sentence	Yes	b	1
Is it true	Yes	b	1
Does onehalf plus onehalf equal one whole hexagon	Yes	b	1
Could you please talk to your team about youre doingReally Knox what did he just do	He says he grabbed three	sd	4
Wrong	I said rhombuses	sd	4
Whats the point of me saying I want you talking and working as a team Lucy	What the point is that to share what the persons thinking and to help each other	sd	4
If Seth is not talking to him about it is that helping Simon to learn any of this information	No	b	1
Aiden if you dont understand what somebody is doing should you be asking them questions	Yes	b	1
All right Anybody needs more time with this or do we think weve all got a pretty good grasp of these first three	We all have a good	sd	1
Mr Tanner can you give me one of your other two number sentences youve created	We have one thats threesixth plus threesixth	sd	4
What shape Only Tanner	So its three rhombuses and three trapezoids	sd	4
Am I holding up one whole	Yes	b	1
Everybody is in agreement that I have one whole	Yes	b	2
Mr Chance please tell me one of the number sentences your team came up with	When you put onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth	sd	5
Do you think we are doing what we are supposed to be doing when we are talking in groups	No	b	1
Does it do it any good for Mr Chance to have an answer onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth if he doesnt know what it means	No	b	1
Would everyone agree that we have one whole	Yes	b	2
Would everybody agree with that	Yes	b	2
Mr Charles please tell me what it is	Our team came up with onethird plus onethird plus onethird	sd	5
What was your answer in fraction form	One whole	sd	4
What fraction would you get by adding one half plus one half	Two halves	sd	4
Does everybody agree	Yes	b	2
Why is two halves the same things as one	Youve got both pieces so youve got	sd	4
It doesnt explain why twohalves equals one whole	Yes but  doesnt understand	sd	3
Yes but  doesnt understand	Why do you	aa	3
Twohalves why does it equal one	Twohalves equals one because	sd	1
Twohalves equals one because	Because we have onehalf	sd	5
Because we have onehalf	I know	aa	1
Mr Javier why is twohalves equal one whole	If you have a whole right here and	sd	4
If you have a whole right here and	Because the numerator is the same as the denominator which means that you  by two pieces to  add a two to make one whole	sd	5
Because the numerator is the same as the denominator which means that you  by two pieces to  add a two to make one whole	If we take one piece away we would have a half so this is one half and this is onehalf	sd	5
If we take one piece away we would have a half so this is one half and this is onehalf	But if you only had one  out of the whole then it wouldnt be a whole	sd	5
But if you only had one  out of the whole then it wouldnt be a whole	So  add another half so it will be a whole	sd	5
Explaining your math thinking isnt always easy is it	I can explain it	sd	1
All right Mr Charles please stand up and tell the class why you think twohalves is equal to one	One half plus one half is two twos because you dont add the denominator	sd	5
But why is two twos as youre calling it twohalves equal the one	Because if you have enough pieces that theyre equal to your denominator then it makes a whole	sd	5
So following up that Diana can you help him out finish this out	Okay	b	1
Okay	So the denominator is how many pieces that you need to make one whole and if the denominator is two and the numerator is two so you have enough to make one whole	sd	5
Because what does the numerator tell us	That you have two pieces	sd	4
Twohalves one well its because of what they just said your denominator tells us what Chance	How many pieces you have	sd	4
Jessica	How many pieces we have left over	sd	4
No thats the remainder	How many wholes we have back in store	sd	4
What does the denominator tell us	How many pieces we need	sd	4
Walker	The total amount that you have	sd	4
Daniel	The denominator tells you how many pieces in the total	sd	4
So when we were dealing with our halves if this is a whole Erics what shape do I need two of	23	b	4
23	What	ba	1
Two what	Two trapezoid	sd	4
So in my fraction 1212 if I put them together that equals	One whole	sd	4
Show me what my improper fraction would look like	Two	sd	1
For the second one what shape are we talking about for number two	Triangle	sd	4
How many triangles Tanner do we need to make one whole	Triangles	sd	1
Triangles	6	b	4
Theyre the blue ones	Oh	b	1
Theyre question number three	Oh yes you need three	sd	4
So if I have three of them do I have one whole	Yes	b	1
Go	We what	sd	1
Go	Okay	b	1
Now can you make a number sentence of that	Yes	b	1
Lets see it	Yes I can make it	sd	1
Now can you make me a number sentence of that	I already did that	sd	1
So Leila please explain to me visually what shapes you used to make your whole	A triangle	sd	4
A triangle	This triangle plus one rhombus	sd	4
What are the other ones called	A rhombus and a trapezoid	sd	4
Everybody agree with that	Yes	b	2
Mr Blake	16131	b	4
16131	Oh my God	ba	1
Oh my God	Oh my God thats scary	ba	1
Would everybody agree that thats what we	Yes	b	2
Yes	But we did it in the wrong	sd	4
Our answer should be three elevenths	What	ba	1
table what did I do wrong	You never add the denominator	sd	4
You never add the denominator	You should	sd	1
what did I do wrong	You never added the denominator	sd	4
Denominator	Yes	b	1
Okay	Because if you add the denominator	sd	4
That thing	Yes that thing	sv	1
Yes that thing	You get the wrong answer	sd	4
So that is the right answer	No	b	1
I heard Seth say that six we should use as our common denominator so I did	Oh yes	b	1
I got it right right	No	b	1
The answer is threesixth	No	b	1
He said its six	Make six a common denominator	sd	4
So my answer is right	No	b	1
No	Because whatever you do the bottom you must do to the top	sd	5
So I have to multiply them all by six	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Now I have the right answer	No	b	1
No	I didnt say you have to multiply everything by six	sd	4
Its what you said	No I wasnt	sd	1
So my answer should be	No	b	1
Three halves	No	b	1
You guys are all quick to point out that Im wrong but youre having a really difficult time telling me why	Im trying to tell you the top one	sv	4
Talk to your team	I get three times one	sd	4
I get three times one	I dont get it anymore	sd	3
I dont get it anymore	I was getting it	sd	1
Talk as you do so	how you find a common denominator	sd	1
Did you fix	No	b	1
When we put on our trapezoid	No that is the wrong answer	sd	4
No that is the wrong answer	Oh my God	ba	1
Oh my God	I dont know what that means	sd	3
I dont know what that means	Were not doing that	sd	1
Is there anybody who can come up here and be the Mr Parker and tell us why	No	b	1
Miss Leia is now the Mr Parker	So you got three numbers and since this is the denominator	sd	5
So you got three numbers and since this is the denominator	So what  because you covered three triangles on one half	sd	5
So what  because you covered three triangles on one half	So the one half becomes threesixth	sd	5
So the one half becomes threesixth	Then the onethird covered two	sd	5
Does everybody understand what shes talking about when she says that	Yes	b	2
Everybody	Yes	b	1
Lucy how did Leia your teammate get threesixth out of one half	Because out of one half because you put three triangles on the rhombus	sd	5
Does everyone agree	Yes	b	2
What Leia did was she said one half equals threesixths and when shes saying one half equals threesixths shes saying that we need to break it into six pieces	Oh	b	1
How did you go from two to six	Because if you multiply two	sd	4
so talk to the classmates tell me what to do	So you multiply two times three because it equals six	sd	5
Okay then	and then you get your answer threesixths	sd	4
Does that look familiar	Yes	b	1
All right what about the next one Leia	Onethird becomes twosixths	sd	5
Onethird becomes twosixths	If you multiply three times two and then one times two you get twosixths and onesixths is	sd	5
What is your final answer	I made a fish	sd	1
Take a look at this one up here	I got	sd	1
Why can we not use three thirds and two halves in this problem talk	Thats why two out of two didnt work	sd	5
Thats why two out of two didnt work	Then you got this	sd	5
Then you got this	How many times did this go into this	sd	3
You can answer this question now	You can not do two halves	sd	4
Charles youre not one of those three youve done all the talking in your team but I want other people to talk	Simon talk you never talk	sd	1
Is two halves equal to one	Yes	b	1
Is threethirds equal to one	Yes	b	1
Is threethird equal to one	Got any ideas	sd	3
Got any ideas	No idea why its not two out of two or three out of three	sd	3
No idea why its not two out of two or three out of three	How many times could this go to this	sd	3
Why wont they work	They wont work because we cant multiply anything to three to get two and we cant multiply anything to two to get three	sd	5
Why do we want to get to those numbers	Because	sd	1
If I take two thirds can I make a half	No	b	1
No	You have an extra one	sd	4
And if I have a half does it equal a third	No	b	1
What does work	is	sd	1
Are all of those shapes the same	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Show me how you can make a whole with just a trapezoid and a rhombus since were having to have both	I think you just	sv	1
Walker let other people think about what you are saying	We can all cover	sd	1
Because it feels at first like nothing	You know how Mr  when you were talking about	sd	1
What do those three shapes have in common	That they can	sd	1
That they can	The can all be	sd	1
The can all be	He said no using triangles	sd	1
He said no using triangles	Tri means three	sd	4
One word	Triangle	sd	4
You were so close	Dividable	sd	4
Charles	Sixths	sd	4
Got it	What	ba	1
There we go	Can I use your pencil really quick to label this	sd	1
Can I use your pencil really quick to label this	Do you want my pencil	sd	1
What is an algorithm	An equation	sd	4
An algorithm Laura	Its like steps	sd	4
Its like steps	A certain way how to solve a problem	sd	4
Ava	All the different steps to solving a problem	sd	4
How does this picture show an algorithm	Well we were saying I was telling Brody that it was a stepbystep procedure because it s going from circle to square and to And then after that back to the circle	sd	5
So if you needed to from the hexagon	You go back to	sd	4
Claire tell me what you re thinking	An algorithm is a stepbystep process	sd	4
An algorithm is a stepbystep process	It s like  circle and then square and then octagon	sd	4
What is fluency Audrey	Like being able to do something quickly and efficiently	sd	4
Someone tell me	Rectangle	aa	4
Audrey	I m number three kid	sd	1
Let s go	Okay so first I just put my thing into I think into 13 going up	sd	5
Okay so first I just put my thing into I think into 13 going up	Then after I made it into 14 sideways and then I labeled them	sd	5
Then after I made it into 14 sideways and then I labeled them	Then I shaded six of the 112 in because if you multiply three times two that will be six	sd	5
Then I shaded six of the 112 in because if you multiply three times two that will be six	Then four times three that would be 12	sd	5
All right number two	What I did is at the Y axis I think it is I did 13 and I divided it by 14	sd	5
What I did is at the Y axis I think it is I did 13 and I divided it by 14	Then I went up the X axis I think it is	sd	5
Then I went up the X axis I think it is	I don t know	sd	5
I don t know	I labelled it 13 and 23 and then I made squares	sd	5
I labelled it 13 and 23 and then I made squares	Then I colored the 23	sd	5
If we are finding 34 times 23 what s the first step we need to do	We need to draw the same	sd	4
Yes did you do it this way	Yes	b	1
So you did these lines and then what did you have to do with those Claire	What I did was I  two other ones and then I shaded	sd	4
Christian	We had to	sd	1
Michael	13 23	b	4
Zoe what do I do now	You look at 34 and 23 and then when they come together it makes a rectangle	sd	5
How many are there total	12	b	4
Have you noticed any patterns when we have been doing this	I noticed that the pattern of a rectangle  that one actually in my math journal	sd	1
Josh	Maybe that since we re always doing four times three	sd	4
Audrey	You multiply the numerators and the denominators	sd	4
You multiply the numerators and the denominators	That s what I was going to say	sd	2
That s what I was going to say	You took my thoughts out of my mouth	sd	2
Four times three is 12	612	b	4
I know you guys are like in on the algorithm right now but we still have to work on those area models	and it just showed me that it was actually really simple	sd	1
and it just showed me that it was actually really simple	So  23 you just multiply the bottom and the top and its easier if you draw a line in between and then times on the top and times on the bottom	sd	5
Remember is it okay if you did yours the other direction	Yes	b	1
What number sentence did you get Luke	I got 13 times 35 equals 315	sd	5
Does this fit our pattern of one times three is three and three times five is 15	Yes	b	1
Charles	Im thinking that the first step is labeling the tick marks and the second step is shading	sd	4
Youre totally right that those are the two steps to find the area model but for solving the problem what are the two steps	Multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators	sd	4
Multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators	That was easy	sd	1
Because when you get to sixthgrade seventhgrade eighthgrade	Ninth grade	sd	1
I want you to turn to page I believe its 178	Do we still need to keep this white page up	sd	1
You may want the white page you may not	Im pretty sure its 179	sd	4
Im pretty sure its 179	179	b	2
Can someone else read this directions for number one Laura	In your own words describe the method for multiplying fractions discovered in class	sd	1
All right	179	b	4
It will dry	It feels weird	sd	1
Can I hear what you wrote for number one Emery	Multiply the numerator and the denominator to get the answer your shading	sd	4
When you said multiply the numerators and denominators it starts to sound like numerator times denominator and thats not what you mean is it	Oh yes	aa	1
See how if you word like first do this then do this that would be helpful	Okay	b	1
Henry what did you put	I  multiply the denominator with the other denominator then you could just multiply the numerator with the other numerator	sd	4
Okay so lets do numerator times numerator denominator times denominator	Okay	b	1
Zoe what did you write	Mine is the algorithm for multiplying fractions as numerator times numerator equals numerator and denominator times denominator	sd	4
Awesome Laura	The first step is to multiply the two numerators by each other and then do the same for the dominator	sd	4
But you dont have to change it but thats Ava	First you multiply the two numerators and the two denominators and into products to make them a fraction	sd	4
Read that again	First you multiply the two numerators and then the two denominators and then you use the products to make them into a fraction	sd	4
Hello people	Heres the microphone	sd	1
Yes Abel	are you supposed to make up a number and then do the whole thing	sd	4
Youre supposed to work backwards from that last number	Oh youre supposed to find out what the first number was	sd	4
Yes	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Thats exactly what I did	sd	4
Im willing to bet that a lot of people did 18  13 to get 5	Yes	b	1
Yes	I got 5	sd	4
What was my number	23	b	4
23	23	b	4
What do we think	Oh I know the answer	sd	1
Anders what do you think	First you need to subtract 10	sd	4
First you need to subtract 10	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	Wait	sd	1
You want to go the other order	I did that right	sd	1
I did that right	You need to Wait	sd	1
What do you do from there	First we need to divide	sd	4
What do I get	2	b	4
Hopefully your answer makes sense after you find your final answer	Can I say what I think this	sd	1
Sure	Is it 16	sd	4
Apollo	Is it 13	sd	4
Yes its 13	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes I knew it	sd	2
Yes I knew it	I knew it	sd	2
Lets work backwards	Wait Oh quadruple	sd	4
Everybody agree with that step so far	Yes	b	2
I think this ones way easier if you leave it as fractions	Oh its five	sd	4

Famous writer	Isnt he a writer	sd	1
who is Edgar Allan Poe	wrote poems	sd	1
He writes poems	He should be Edgar Allan Poe M	sd	1
He should be Edgar Allan Poe M	Can I guess the answer	sd	1
No youre going to have to wait and see	You have to think its funny	sv	1
What do you say if Edgar Allan Poe is about to run into a tree	I dont know Mr G what	sd	1
Poe a tree	Poetry like hes a poet	sd	1
Poetry like hes a poet	That makes so much sense now	sd	1
Yes	It was so funny I forgot to laugh	sd	1

Can you figure out how many coins are in each pouch	23	b	1
23	How can this equation help you	sd	1
How can this equation help you	Three	sd	1
Three	It must be really small	sd	1
It could be any different number but	Theres always 11	sd	4
Wynn what do you think	I counted out the coins and theres 5 coins next to the pouches	sd	5
I counted out the coins and theres 5 coins next to the pouches	Then I did the 11  5	sd	5
Then I did the 11  5	Then since theres two pouches and 11  5  6 I did 6  2 and then that equals 3	sd	5
Those six coins get split between two pouches so then you divide it by two at the end right	Yes	b	1
Underneath your problem lets write pouch  3	Can you say it on the box	sd	1
Five so we are going to write  five and right there does this look like an equation that weve been working on	Yes	b	1
Thats our equation for this first problem	Wait	sd	1
Yes Abel	Would the X be representing this number of coins inside the bags	sd	4
2X part means theres two of them	Two and the number of coins	sd	4
Apollo	I was stretching	sd	1
Remember dont spend too much time drawing out real pouches unless you really really want to	I really really want to	sd	1
I really really want to	I already did that	sd	1
All right but still dont spend too much time doing it	Im still working on my first pouch	sd	1
Im still working on my first pouch	One two three four five six coins	sd	4
One two three four five six coins	What does MSA stand for	sd	3
Look you  what strategy it is	For the equation	sd	1
First how do we even get an answer	Can I just say what the answer is	sd	1
Sure	In these bags are four coins	sd	4
How did you figure that out	Well theres 12 overall coins and theres 4 outside of the bag	sd	5
Well theres 12 overall coins and theres 4 outside of the bag	I did 12  4 which equals eight	sd	5
I did 12  4 which equals eight	Then 8  2 because theres 2 bags	sd	5
Its the same	No its not	sd	1
No its not	Can I do the equation	sd	1
Sure you can do the equation	2X  4	aa	5
2X  4	2X because theres two pouches plus 4	sd	5
2X because theres two pouches plus 4	12	b	5
Does everybody agree that those are two of the same thing	Yes	b	2
Could I take half of this one as well	Yes	b	1
If a pouch and two coins  6 coins is that really the same answer	Yes	b	1
Could this be written as X  2 over here	Yes	b	1
Does everybody agree that means pouch plus two coins	Yes	b	2
How many sections of that did we have to start	Its two	sd	4
If you think about it that way people want to be like okay well lets divide it in half first and then well solve it from there	Say this problem was on a test or something would both equations both work be the answer to the problem	sd	4
Laim	What if you have an uneven amount of coins on the other side	sd	3
Ready to try another one	Yes	b	1
Does somebody have an equation so we think about it in that way	3X  3  30	sd	5
Oliver what do you think	In these ones the quantity of X  1  30	sd	5
What is my number	Thats the same one	sd	4
Thats the same one	Thats the same thing nine	sd	4
Im thinking of a number I triple my number then I add three and I end up with 30	I was going to do the steps	sd	1
What is it	The way I did it was I Since one of the sections is 10 total if you divide	sd	4
Hold on a second because I dont know if we can think about it that way just from the word part	Wait are we asking how to do this	sd	1
Yes if were going backwards how do we do this in the word part	You start with 30	sd	5
You start with 30	You subtract 3 from 30 which is 27	sd	5
You subtract 3 from 30 which is 27	Then you divide it by three because it said triple and you go backwards and you get nine	sd	5
Does that sound like the steps that we just did	Yes	b	1
Do those sound like the same steps that we just did	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Were going to talk about it in a second	This is really easy	sd	1
Go	Hey Mr G what do the buttons do on this	sd	1

Ill give you 30 more seconds	I crossed out the extra change	sd	5
I crossed out the extra change	Then the pouches and nine	sd	5
Sure to solve it	Then two pouches then two pouches here so you cross out that cross out those two and cross out those two and you are left with one pouch and nine coins	sd	5
Then there are at least two pouches on both sides	Thats what I did	sd	1
Thats what I did	That makes it so much easier	sd	1
That makes it so much easier	I went up from three	sd	4
9  9 is	18	b	4
Ariella whats an equation for this	3X  3  2X  12	sd	5
Did anybody solve it a different way	Kind of	sd	2
Kind of	I solved it the same way exactly the same but with the equation	sd	2
With the equation	I solved it with the coin and only crossing out two coins and only crossing out two bags and then crossing out two coins on that side and the two bags	sd	5
You only did it by crossing out two coins	Yes	b	1
Here	I crossed out two coins and then I crossed out Yes two coins on that side	sd	5
I crossed out two coins and then I crossed out Yes two coins on that side	I crossed out two bags and two bags and then I	sd	5
I crossed out two bags and two bags and then I	The bag and the coin	sd	5
The bag and a coin is 10	Yes	b	1
Can anybody think of one that uses parenthesis for both sides	Technically you could just add parenthesis	sd	4
Ariella what do you think	Three times the quantity of X  1 is equal to two times the quantity of X  6	sd	5
Does everybody see that	Yes	b	1
Okay for number 1 what was For number 1  what was the common denominator		b	4
	Yeah	b	2

Okay	Are we going to do	sd	1
Asher	That theyre all equal	sd	4
Brendan	Its like the half of the number	sd	4
I see 24 and I see 48s	Theyre equivalent fractions because they are each a half but theyre just different	sd	4
Elaina	Each of the fractions theyre both	sd	4
Theyre all split in what	Theyre all half	sd	4
Ariana what did Laura say	Theyre all half	sd	4
Find your hole	Red circle	sd	1
Find your half find your third	Im just taking everything out the bag	sd	1
Find your fourth	So this is irrelevant	sd	1
So this is irrelevant	So I need to find half	sd	1
Those are orange	How does this one fit together	sd	3
I think I have to count but	yellow	sd	4
Does anyone have an extra fifth which is what color	Green	sd	4
Some of you might have an extra color so if you have an extra one let me know	Two green	sd	4
Two green	What color is it for	sd	3
Purple is Purple is tenths	I have two greens	sd	1
Dark blue	Is irrelevant	sd	1
Is irrelevant	We dont have a dark blue	sd	1
If anyone has extra colors let me know	I have a double	sd	1
You have an extra one	Ive got an extra black	sd	1
Ive got an extra black	extra black	sd	1
Okay let me know	Miss	sd	1
What is what	6	b	3
6	Oh is it this one	sd	4
Okay then	Wait Im not ready	sd	1
I want you to use them  fraction circle pieces	Which one do we get out	sd	3
You dont have this	I dont have 7	sd	1
You dont have	Do we have 7	sd	1
You can borrow mine then	Theres no 7	sd	1
Want me to throw this away	Im going to run out of space	sd	1
Im going to run out of space	The black ones are sharp	sd	1
The black ones are sharp	The black ones are really sharp	sd	1
You have to solve all three	The black ones are really sharp	sd	1
The black ones are really sharp	Its like a puzzle but not a puzzle	sd	1
Its like a puzzle but not a puzzle	Miss  how are we supposed to get a black	sd	1
Okay what is our common denominator		b	4
Im seeing how many  so 14  13	Thats just a half	sd	4
Okay when you figure out how many 12s  14  13 gives me a thumbs up	I dont even know	sd	3
How many 12s goes into 13  14	That many	sd	4
That many	Agree	sd	2
So our answer is 712	differently	sd	1
Okay	So first I put 312 on a 14 and I know that 24 can fit in so theres 14 by the  thats 14 then I can fit one more 14 on top but  one more  left over  and then put another 14 by it knowing that one does also have 312	sd	5
Okay	And then there was one space left over	sd	4
And then there was one space left over	Thats how I got my answer	sd	4
Who has the answer	Not me	sd	1
Who has the answer	34	b	4
Agree	Yes and	sd	2
Yes and	Well I disagree because you can do it a different way	sd	2
One minute	Done	b	1
Done	Done	b	1
Done	Done	b	1
This one is called greater than	Less than equal to	sd	4
Miss Laurie	Because theres not a common denominator	sd	5
What does that mean	The sizes arent the pieces arent the same size	sd	4
George	Try to find a common denominator	sd	4
Whats the cheat you can always use that Mr Parker work Marie	Multiply 6 times 9	sd	4
Perfect well not six times nine were doing denominators multiply	8 times 12	sd	4
But remember you must not only do the denominator because whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	sd	4
Oy yoi yoi I picked this because I know a lot of you have not been practicing your 12s like you should be	96	b	4
And how did we get to 96 on the left side of the equation and however we did it on the bottom	You must do to the top	sd	4
Whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	sd	4
Okay so Mr Julian has the right answer	The cameras not recording	sd	1
Max	12	b	4
This is what your paper should look like whatever we do to the bottom	You must do to the top	sd	4
So if we multiply the bottom by 12 we have to multiply	The top	sd	4
Marie I know youve been working on your twelves what is six times 12	76	b	4
Robin	72	b	4
Now we must go to the other side and Alreya when we got 96 on this side what do we have to multiply times 12 to equal 96	Eight	aa	4
Eight so whatever we do to the bottom	You must do to the top	sd	4
Have you noticed that I keep saying that over and over again	Yes	b	1
Do you think thats gonna be a big part of fourth grade	Yes	b	1
So do you think theyre mildly important	Yes	b	1
Find a	Common denominator	sd	4
And whatever you	Do to the top you must do to the bottom	sd	4
What did she say	Um	b	1
Michelle	Because the denominators are not equal	sd	5
What did she say why we could not compare them originally Noah	Cuz the pieces are not the same size	sd	5
So Mr Max why do we find a common denominator	Becuase you want to know what the warm up was about	sd	5
Ay yay yay Hunter why do we want to find a common denominator	So we could um	sd	1
Alreya	Because the pieces are not the same size	sd	5
You cant order them you cant add them or you cannot subtract them unless they are the	Same size	sd	4
Truman	Onehalf	aa	4
And that fraction is written like this correct	Yes	b	1
Jack what is it now	Twofourths	sd	4
Why is it twofourths Savannah	Is it twofourths because we multiplied the top number by two and the bottom number by two	sd	5
Are we changing just this part	No	b	1
Are we changing just the part that we did eat	No	b	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Literally its not a trick	Because thats what we multiplied to get 96	sd	5
You went over one too many fingers start and count over eight not nine	Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneight	sd	1
Mm hmm	72	b	4
So now ladies and gentlemen is it clear to see what the answer should have been	Yes	b	1
So guess what were going to do today	Find the common denominator	sd	4
Well just turn it off	Cant you just get a different computer until its working	sd	1
Is everybody listening to my directions	Yeah	b	1
Noah	Can you use scratch paper	sd	1
Why is it that for number one you can find the answer even without finding a common denominator Marie	Because it has a little bit of work	sd	5
Hernan	Theres the same number of pieces	sd	5
So it has a common	Numerator	sd	4
We could multiply them both together and get what	Eight	sd	4
Eight or is two a multiple of four	Yes	b	1
Now do you see that twofourths is bigger than one fourth	Yeah	b	1
List your	Factors multiples	sd	4
Whats three times 8	24	b	4
24	Can I please go to the bathroom	sd	1
So number two Mr Jack what two fractions are we trying to compare on number two	Onehalf and oneninth	sd	4
Onehalf and oneninth	Onehalf and oneninth	sd	2
Onehalf and what	Oneninth	sd	4
What two fractions are we comparing	Threeeighths and twothirds	sd	4
So if I multiply three times eight Isabelle what Mr Parker I get	24	b	4
Tell him I already know	Because three times eight equals 24	sd	5
Mr George is a world renowned teacher at Harvard University and he has been kind enough to come back today and teach us simple things like finding common denominators	So basically we multiply those two together eight times three and then you get 24	sd	5
Pick somebody to help you out	Robin	sd	1
Ok Miss Robin teach	So how we get 24 is we times	sd	4
Did you just say we times	No we multiply	sd	4
I was getting a little nervous there	You multiply eight times three to equal 24	sd	5
You multiply eight times three to equal 24	So what you do was	qy	1
Alright lets see if Robin can explain it	So why we do it is eight times three equals 24 because we multiply	sd	5
Not to mention youre wearing a hat in my class which doesnt make me happy	When you multiply the two numbers	sd	4
Dont talk to the board the board doesnt care	You multiply eight times three because when you multiply if youre like trying to figure out which faction is bigger you have to multiply the denominators and youre always going to get your answer	sd	5
Youre saying the same thing Robin said who said the same thing George said	Because you can always multiply	sd	5
Miss Polly please tell our class why multiplying eight times three gives us our common denominator	Multiplying eight times three gives you your common denominator because 24 is a multiple of both the numbers	sd	5
Ladies and gentlemen remember me teaching you factors and multiples and saying how important theyre going to be	Yes	b	1
You can go help your team real quick and then you can come back and finish the problem	Yes	b	1
The answer is	Nothing	sd	4
Whats three times 5	15	b	4
Whats three times 6	18	b	4
Please tell us how you knew 48 would work	48 would work because three can be 48 is a multiple of both 8 and 3	sd	5
What can we multiply 24 by to equal 48	Thats my short cut	sd	4
24 times two is	48	b	4
How did we get to where were at so far	Ok so you multiply	aa	4
The board doesnt care	Ok so to get to 24 we multiply 8 times 3 and we get 3 and 2 and then we multiply by 3	sd	5
Ok so to get to 24 we multiply 8 times 3 and we get 3 and 2 and then we multiply by 3	To get to 24 on this side we multiply by eight and we have to do that to the top and 2 times 8 is 16	sd	5
Youre not done	Sixteens bigger than nine	sd	4
Sixteens bigger than nine	Yes	b	1
Alreya please tell me which two fractions we are comparing in number 3	Foureighths and seventwelfths	sd	4
We just did one just like this	96	b	4
Is seven more than half or less than half of 12	More	aa	4
What am I missing	A numerator	sd	4
And we know that whatever happens to the bottom has to happen to the	Top	aa	4
So Mr Hunter what did I multiply by eight to get 96	12	b	4
So what am I gonna multiply four by	12	b	4
And when I do what do I get	48	b	4
Evan whats missing on this side	Your numerator	sd	4
So how did I get from 12 to 96	Times eight	sd	4
So what am I gonna have to multiply seven by	Eight	aa	4
And if theres anybody in the room who does not know what eight times seven is you dont belong in fourth grade anymore	56	b	4
So which one is bigger	56	b	4
Miss Laurie huh	Thats how I did it	sd	4
Oh I thought you did it with a	No I did different ones on 4 5 and 6	sd	4
Mr Abner what two fractions are we comparing on number four	Twothirds	sd	4
Twothirds and	Eleventwelfths	sd	4
No wonder Jesus beat you huh	36	b	4
Multiplied by	12	b	4
So what should I multiply two by	12	b	4
And what is 12 times two	24	b	4
Miss Jessica what do I multiply 12 by to equal 36	Three	sd	4
So what must I multiply 11 by	Three	sd	4
And if I multiply 11 times three what do I get	33	b	4
So the first thing I did was see if I could multiply anything by three to get to twelve	And	sd	1
Did everybody hear what she said	Yes	b	1
What did she say Truman	She said she was going to multiply three times twelve	sd	4
And thats okay because it was a little quiet please repeat what you said	So the first thing I did was see if I could multiply anything by three to get to twelve	sd	4
Mr Max	Because its a denominator of twelve	sd	5
The answer is could we do my way	Yes	b	1
Does Lauries way work too	Yes	b	1
Why does your way work just as well as mine in fact yours is actually a better way than mine	Because I dont have to cut it into as many pieces as you are	sd	5
So what are you trying to accomplish by multiplying three times four	By getting a smaller by cutting it into by cutting it into more than three pieces but less than 36	sd	4
Go ahead and write out what you did Laurie so she can see it	So I figured out that three times four equals twelve	sd	5
Julian	Lauries way is gonna work because three times four is 12 and 12 is the common and 12 is the common denominator that we need	sd	5
Does it matter what your common denominator is as long as your two numbers are multiples of it	No	b	1
Multiples of	12	b	4
Because is three a factor of 12	Yes	b	1
Whats so great about her way versus my way Josh whats so great about her way versus my way	Because it gives you more pieces	sd	5
Uhhuh	Shes reducing the fraction	sd	2
Who did more work	You	aa	1
Noah	Because we always have to try to find a less denominator	sd	5
Mr Parker this work every time	Yes	b	1
What could we multiply two by to equal four	Times two	sd	1
Now whatever we do to the top	We do to the bottom	sd	4
Whatever we do to the bottom	We must do to the top	sd	4
Whatever we do to the bottom	We must do to the top	sd	4
So what do we get	You would get twofourths	sd	4
Who do you think up there Truman you Mr Parker work the best with and listen to	I dont know	sd	1
Pick	Its hard to make decisions	sd	1
I have to get through the rest of class you have 3 seconds to do this	Noah	sd	1
Wheres your sheet Truman	You didnt give me one	sd	1
Coaches come pair up	Are we working on this side or this side	sd	1
Less than greater than or equal to	Thank you	aa	1
This is confusing isnt it	Yeah	b	1
Okay so Why did you say less than	Because 34 is closer to the whole than 912	sd	5
Landon	Because 34s is already equal to 34	sd	5
Because 34s is already equal to 34	And then we multiply it by three	sd	5
And then we multiply it by three	That doesnt mean it can be greater but not of the top of our heads but it probably is a little greater because its multiplying it	sd	5
Yes	Youre finding	sd	1
So its going to be three times greater right	Yeah	b	1
Carson do you remember	Because its multiplying by one which anything times one is just the original number	sd	5
Cooper	So what I did was	sd	1
So what I did was	So if you look at 34 of  and a half is bigger than 14 so youre adding fourths	sd	5
So if you look at 34 of  and a half is bigger than 14 so youre adding fourths	So if you had	sd	1
Were adding	Or youre multiplying by a half so basically youre multiplying it by 24	sd	5
Or youre multiplying by a half so basically youre multiplying it by 24	So that would be bigger than 34 is staying how it is	sd	5
So that would be bigger than 34 is staying how it is	It just stayed 34 while the others are multiplied by  fraction	sd	5
Do you agree with that Alec	Yes	b	2
Yes	I put no	sd	2
Okay	34 and 12 equals 38	sd	5
34 and 12 equals 38	And the other number which is 34 which equals  whole probably make it bigger greater	sd	4
Landon did you have something different	Oh no that was pretty much it	sd	1
This one	Yeah	b	1
This is bigger	Yeah	b	1
Because	I think that because when we multiply by one its the same number	sd	5
I think that because when we multiply by one its the same number	And its a fraction its less than one	sd	5
And its a fraction its less than one	So its going to be less than one  itself	sv	5
All right do I have any brave so who want to explain why they answered the way they did	I said 34 is bigger because the 78 isnt a one yet like the after it	sd	5
I said 34 is bigger because the 78 isnt a one yet like the after it	So it would have to be less	sd	5
And you checked your answer by	I multiplied 4 times 8 is 32	sd	5
I multiplied 4 times 8 is 32	And then 3 times 7 is 21	sd	5
And then 3 times 7 is 21	So I got 21 out of 32	sd	5
This side or this side	The left side	sd	4
So why is that bigger	Well its  be the same because	sd	4
Yep	It changes	sd	4
Tom tell us your convincing argument	I think its equal because 33 is basically one whole so you can just change that 33 to one whole	sd	5
I think its equal because 33 is basically one whole so you can just change that 33 to one whole	And then 34 times 1 is the same answer as 34 so theyd be equal	sd	5
Are you guys convinced now	Yep	b	2
Wait you just told me you werent convinced by	Oh	b	1
Are you trying to convince somebody on your team	I had the same answer as Tom	sd	2
Oh equal yeah	Im trying to convince them	sd	2
Alec	Im technically just going to say the same thing	sd	2
So we heard what Tom said very clearly	and then  but he said 34 times 1 it would be	sd	5
and then  but he said 34 times 1 it would be	34 times 33 and then you have 912 is 34 times	sd	5
34 times 33 and then you have 912 is 34 times	It was on the board	sd	1
It was on the board	And then that is equal to it because even 4 times 3 equals the 12 in the denominator	sd	5
And then that is equal to it because even 4 times 3 equals the 12 in the denominator	And then you get 3 times 3 equals 9 for the numerator	sd	5
Whats 20 times 1		b	4
Okay so whats 34 times 1	34	b	4
Okay are we good	Yeah	b	1
Try to come up with some different situations	There is a room that is eight square feet one way and seven square feet in the other way	sd	4
There is a room that is eight square feet one way and seven square feet in the other way	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And you would do 7 times 8 equals 56	sd	5
And you would do 7 times 8 equals 56	So theres a room in the house that  the area is 56	sd	5
So theres a room in the house that  the area is 56	How would you figure out that is 56 feet	sv	3
How would you figure out that is 56 feet	Id count by seven	sd	2
Id count by seven	Yes	b	2
Yes	Because its the area of the room not the perimeter of the room	sd	5
Because its the area of the room not the perimeter of the room	Do you want to say	qy	1
So whats the situation	Theres a room filled with  Did you say tires	sd	4
A room with tires in it	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How many	sd	3
How many	How much tires can you fit in there	sd	3
How much tires can you fit in there	Tiles	sd	2
I was hearing tires	I was like Tires	sd	1
Theyre talking school right now	Ah	b	1
And they talked about school buses too with certain kids in them	Tires I was like No way	sd	1
Uhoh I broke it I think	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	Okay	b	1
Okay	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	right	b	1
Okay Alec give us your example	There are seven boxes of basketballs	sd	4
There are seven boxes of basketballs	Each one has eight basketballs in them	sd	4
Each one has eight basketballs in them	How many balls are there	sd	4
Seven boxes of basketballs eight in each box	I feel like its kind of area	sd	4
Area	Because its thinking of boxes	sd	5
Okay so maybe if you What do you think Cooper	I actually think its volume because its a 3D object and its a box	sd	5
Hmm interesting	Itd be equal groups	sd	4
Logan what was your problem or your	I bought seven	sd	4
I bought seven	Hang on	sd	1
Hang on	I want to fix my	sd	1
Youre going to fix yours	Yeah	b	1
Thats okay	I wrote mine	sd	1
Cooper	Okay	b	1
Okay	Seven bags of nuts fit eight nuts in each bag	sd	4
Seven bags of nuts fit eight nuts in each bag	If they have 56 nuts how many more bags will they need	sd	4
Isaac	I think it might be a division problem	sd	4
Okay	I think it might be a division problem	sd	4
An equal group	A division problem	sd	4
So can we turn most division problems into a multiplication problem	Yes	b	1
Why can we do that	Because they are technically opposite of multiplication	sd	5
Okay Carson what was your area problem	area problem was youre in a room thats eight feet for the length and seven feet for the width	sd	4
area problem was youre in a room thats eight feet for the length and seven feet for the width	You are putting down tiles	sd	4
You are putting down tiles	How many tiles do you need	sd	4
How many tiles do you need	And each tiles a foot	sd	4
Okay did that work	Yes	b	1
Logan do you have yours	I bought seven packs of apples and eight packs of grapes	sd	5
I bought seven packs of apples and eight packs of grapes	Seven times eight equals 56	sd	5
Seven times eight equals 56	So it would be 56	sd	5
I think it probably would be	Yeah equal groups	sd	4
Landon	I have one that is the second one	sd	1
Oh awesome	So the room is eight feet in length and seven feet in width	sd	5
So the room is eight feet in length and seven feet in width	How big is the room inches	sd	5
How big is the room inches	And  180 inches	sd	5
Thats definitely a conversion	Mine is some people are making two sets of rugs	sd	4
Mine is some people are making two sets of rugs	The length of each rug needs to be seven yards long and eight yards long	sd	4
What is that	Area	sd	4
So area is length times width and volume would be length times width times	Height	sd	4
The comparisons are Oh so if Toms little brother is seven years old	I dont have a little brother	sd	1
And dont say Really old	He was really old	sd	1
Okay so you could compare	Yeah hes really old	sd	1
Yeah hes really old	Hes a senior	sd	1
My dog is half as tall as I am	Hes huge	sd	1
So youre learning intention today Eric will you read it for us	fraction multiplication numbers  with numeral context	sd	1
Were you three working together	Yeah	b	1
You guys get this one	Recording	aa	1
You guys get this one	Oh we could do conversions	sd	1
Oh we could do conversions	Because one of them could be	sd	1
Have you got a problem	Yes so were going to	sd	1
Yes so were going to	Timmy had six slices of a pizza	sd	4
Timmy had six slices of a pizza	He ate half the pizza	sd	4
He ate half the pizza	How much did Timmy have left	sd	4
Does that work	Yeah	b	1
You guys did fine	Lets just multiply for the answer	sd	4
Are you guys now	No way	sd	1
No way	No I dont think at all	sd	1
You dont think	Your bangs are  with your mask on	sv	1
You guys done	No were still figuring	sd	1
would that help you think of it better	thats what Im trying to do is change the denominator into a 6	sd	4
thats what Im trying to do is change the denominator into a 6	Because would be an even number so then it would be easier for us to find	sd	5
Because would be an even number so then it would be easier for us to find	Figure out	sd	2
Okay	Oh wait	sd	1
Oh wait	I did that wrong	sd	4
I did that wrong	Nevermind	sd	1
So youre going to have to split something up right	Yeah	b	1
I always think about food	Oh food	ba	1
Oh food	We could	sd	1
We could	Okay lets start over	sd	1
Okay lets start over	Any red marker	sd	1
So	Eight pizzas for three people	sd	4
Eight pizzas for three people	What is the total area of the floor	sd	4
He went to the party	Well just say that	sd	1
Well just say that	We dont	sd	1
We dont have an answer	What is the total area for the	sd	4
And then what would the question be	The question would be	sd	1
Everybody listen	Our numbers were 12 and 6	sd	4
Okay	And so we did a subtraction problem	sd	4
We were supposed to do multiplication	So we wrote Timmy had six pieces of pizza and ate half of that which was  three	sd	4
What is this	three	sd	4
What does that mean	Thats the answer	sd	4
What	Leftover pieces of pizza	sd	4
Anna	The three represents	sd	1
The what	The numerator	sd	4
The numerator	Oh nevermind	sd	1
Carson	The answer	sd	4
Can we be more specific	How much was eaten	sd	4
You guys	Our numbers were 12 and 56	sd	4
Our numbers were 12 and 56	Whats going on	sd	3
Everybody listen up	Joe has 56 of a sandwich	sd	4
Joe has 56 of a sandwich	And he eats 12 of the sandwich	sd	4
And he eats 12 of the sandwich	How much of the sandwich is left for Joe	sd	4
So my number model is 56 times 12	Yeah	b	1
Do you think its how much was left	Yeah	b	1
What does that answer represent	How much he ate	sd	4
Cooper	Okay	b	1
Okay	A family is putting in a new guest room and are trying to find how much carpet they need	sd	4
A family is putting in a new guest room and are trying to find how much carpet they need	Onefourth of the room will be blue and fourfifths of the room will be red	sd	4
Onefourth of the room will be blue and fourfifths of the room will be red	What is total area of meters that room will need	sd	4
Okay so what were your two numbers	14 and 45	sd	4
So the 14 represented what	The 14 represented the blue carpet on the floor	sd	4
The 14 represented the blue carpet on the floor	Because the familys putting in carpet and need to find the area of how much carpet its going to need	sd	5
Because the familys putting in carpet and need to find the area of how much carpet its going to need	And 14 of the carpet is blue and 45 is red will be blue	sd	2
And 14 of the carpet is blue and 45 is red will be blue	Will be	sd	1
Will be	Fourfifths is red	sd	2
Fourfifths is red	And then we finding a total area of meters in the room	sd	2
Im just trying to understand	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Onefourth of a meter was blue	Well will be blue because theyre putting it in	sd	4
Well will be blue because theyre putting it in	Theyre trying to figure out how much carpet they need to go to the store and get	sd	4
Theyre trying to figure out how much carpet they need to go to the store and get	So they need to figure out how much theyll need	sd	4
So they need to figure out how much theyll need	How many meters	sd	2
Okay	And 45 will be red	sd	4
Fourfifths will be red	And then we figured it out that its 1 120 because we did the	sd	4
And then we figured it out that its 1 120 because we did the	The common denominator	sd	2
So you	Because we did	sd	1
What was your answer	1 120	b	4
So you guys added	No	b	1
No	No we did that because were doing area	sd	5
No we did that because were doing area	We multiplied the 14 by the 45	sd	5
Oh so whats 14 times 45 if you multiply if we use our algorithm what do you get	420	b	4
Which is the answer that you guys need to be trying to get	Well we tried to  common denominator	sd	4
Does that make more sense to you	Yeah	b	1
Carson did you want to go next	Yes	b	1
Yes	You threw a party and ordered eight pizzas	sd	4
You threw a party and ordered eight pizzas	You and your friends ate 23 of the pizzas	sd	4
You and your friends ate 23 of the pizzas	How much of the pizza did you eat	sd	4
Anna	13 of  How much	sd	4
Who wants to go next	Okay	b	1
Okay	Timmy had 23 of an apple	sd	4
Timmy had 23 of an apple	He got 10 more apple baskets	sd	4
He got 10 more apple baskets	How  does he have	sd	4
Okay so 10 What	Timmy had 23 of an apple	sd	4
Of an apple	Apple basket	sd	4
Of a basket	He got 10 more baskets	sd	4
10 more apples	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	An apple basket	sd	2
An apple basket	How many apples does he have	sd	2
How many apples does he have	Ms Gibson	aa	1
Ms Gibson	I think you missed Because when he was reading it the second time I heard him say	sd	2
I think you missed Because when he was reading it the second time I heard him say	If Im correct Tom	sd	1
If Im correct Tom	Correct me if Im not	sd	2
Correct me if Im not	23 of an apple basket am I correct	sd	2
23 of an apple basket am I correct	At least thats what I heard	sd	2
So do you want the number model to be what	23 times 10	sd	4
What does the 6 and 23 mean	How many apples	sd	4
But did you ever tell me how many apples are in the basket	23 of	sd	4
23 of an apple is in the basket	like the basket apple	sd	1
23 of the basket are filled with apples	And 10 more apples	sd	4
You added 10 more apples to that	It would be times	sd	4
So it would be plus right	Yeah	b	1
If we had 10 apples what do we do with the fraction so that the number model had to be this	You could make	sd	1
Alec	He ate 23 of the apples	sd	4
What does the 6 and 23 represent	How many apples they ate	sd	4
Did we do yours	Okay	b	1
Im ready	A class split a big chocolate bar	sd	4
A class split a big chocolate bar	And the groups are A and B	sd	4
I heard chocolate bar	A class split a big chocolate bar between group A and B	sd	4
Okay so we have groups A and B	And group B took 56	sd	4
And group B took 56	And group B took 23	sd	4
23 of what	23 of chocolate bar	sd	4
If group B ate 56 of it could group A eat 23	Oh	b	1
So 23 of Kennedy	23 of 16	sd	4
23 of 16	23 is supposed to be a 13	sd	2
23 is supposed to be a 13	23 of the sixth	sd	2
This should be 13	Yeah its supposed to be 13	sd	4
So Group a ate 13 of what	The last sixth	sd	4
What does the 518 represent	How much of the chocolate bar they ate	sd	4
Who ate	Group A	sd	4
This is what you were doing just now right	Yeah	b	2
Everybody say Representation	Representation	sd	1
Cooper	Something that  so kind of like a picture of something	sd	4
Yeah its a picture of something	Kind of like if you do 13 Ill show a picture of	sd	4
All right as always I am available to help	I	b	1
Do you have a question	What do you mean like match them up	sd	3
Im sorry	What do yo mean like match them up	sd	3
You need to match the picture with the multiplication problem	You mean cut them out	sd	1
Yeah	Oh its kind of like the	sd	1
Matching game	Yeah	b	1
Youre going to work with your shoulder partner	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	We have your scissors	sd	1
I want you to write that down so that you tell your brain what to look for while youre learning today	What is a tape diagram	sd	3
Okay Robert	Yeah	b	1
Do you want to count with me up here	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Three	sd	1
Yeah Adeline	What happens if it isnt exact	sd	3
Yeah Adeline	Will we have to write a number sentence on the test	sd	1
Lucas P what part of our number sentence when we have seven what does seven represent	Seven represents what number you divided by two	sd	4
In our number sentence Adeline what does two represent	Two represents thewhat were dividing	sd	4
Is it the size of the groups or the number of groups	Number of groups	sd	4
Briella what do you think	Could we do a half	sd	4
Could we do a half	So three and a half	sd	4
Xavier what are your thoughts about three and a half being our answer	I think its right because seven cant be cut in half because its an odd number	sd	5
I think its right because seven cant be cut in half because its an odd number	So I think it would be three and three is six and then the two halves can make a whole and that would equal up to seven	sd	5
So I think it would be three and three is six and then the two halves can make a whole and that would equal up to seven	So I think its three and a half	sd	5
So this piece would have to have one more piece right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How is that three and a half	sd	3
Kind of in the middle right there	What was  done before	sd	1
What was  done before	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	But both of them	sd	4
And over here one two three and then this half	Well yeah because only one of the threes took the half and it wouldnt be seven	sd	5
Well yeah because only one of the threes took the half and it wouldnt be seven	Because you need both the threes that would equal six and you need both the halves	sd	5
Because you need both the threes that would equal six and you need both the halves	Because the other halves make a whole and then its a whole number	sd	5
Allen how many times do you think that twothirds fits into one whole	I think	sv	1
I think	Can you go over	sd	3
Can you go over	Or is does it have to be exact	sd	3
Its going to be the answer is going to be an exact number	Oh	b	1
Oh	Okay	b	1
Okay	So I think you could divide it	sd	5
So I think you could divide it	Divide twothirds by two to get like you could divide the numerator	sd	5
Divide twothirds by two to get like you could divide the numerator	So you can get onethird and then add that maybe	sd	5
So do you think are you thinking one and onethird	Yeah	b	1
Kendall what are you thinking	Did you just call my name	sd	1
Yeah	Oh	b	1
Oh	What was the question	sd	1
How many times does twothirds fit into one whole	Um	b	1
Um	Twice	sd	4
So Remy what do you think	I guess this probably isnt right but maybe one and a half	sd	4
Remy can you explain where you got one and a half from	Since twothirds is being treated as like well its not being treated as a whole but	sd	5
Since twothirds is being treated as like well its not being treated as a whole but	I dont really know how to explain this but like twothirds is this other number that is being multiplied or added	sd	5
Yeah its the size of our group	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And one whole would be the extra half of twothirds	sd	5
And one whole would be the extra half of twothirds	So I just put one and a half	sd	5
Yeah Briella	I was just going to say I agree  because I know that one group	sd	5
I was just going to say I agree  because I know that one group	I put one with two groups so then I made the next little square another third and then I added those twothirds then I got three over three	sd	5
I put one with two groups so then I made the next little square another third and then I added those twothirds then I got three over three	And I also know that it equals one whole	sd	5
And I also know that it equals one whole	So I added that to one and	sd	5
Yeah Adeline	If were dividing one divided by twothirds how did we get something bigger than one	sd	3
Yes Briella	Would this happen most of the time whenever theres a left number like little space equal to onehalf	sd	4
I hope I didnt zoom in too much here how many threefourths are in one whole	Why is the whole so big	sd	3
This little part right here	Yeah yeah	b	1
Is that better	Yeah	b	1
What fraction of the part is that	Is it onethird	sd	4
Collin do you agree disagree or have a question about Liliths proposal	I agree	aa	2
How come you agree	Oh because I was kind of just what I got too I guess	sd	2
Howd you get that too	I did the	sd	1
Your answer for that one would be one and onethird	How would it why wouldnt it be threefourths	sd	3
So when we look at this do you see how I circled threefourths will fit into one whole one time right	Oh	b	1
Do you see how this would fit in one two three times	Kind of	sd	1
So if I took this little piece here	It could fit in all three of them	sd	4
So that would be onethird	Because one square	sd	5
Yeah Giselle	Why wouldnt it be onefourth	sd	3
Because youre right that its onefourth of a whole but it is one third of the size of the piece that we are dividing things into	Oh okay	b	1
Yeah Adeline	So the answer would be one and onethird	sd	4
Yeah Allaya	Since we already know that onethird is equal like theres one and onethird in one could we just have one and a half plus one and a half plus one and a half	sd	5
And then I have this left over piece right here	Would it be onefourth because one could go into each  can go into each two times	sd	5
We want to know how many times this piecelike we want to know this piece what fraction of a part is it	That would be onehalf	sd	4
So youre proposing half	Yeah	b	1
Adeline what are you thinking	I am actually a little confused	sd	3
I am actually a little confused	Why the tape line why did they get into that many spaces	sd	3
Because we had three wholes and I had heres one	Oh got it	sd	1
Two and then I divided it into thirds because I needed to do groups of twothirds	So when you  you put it into all of them do you count all empty spaces	sd	4
Is that what Im hearing you say Xavier	Yeah	b	1
So Dominick do you agree disagree or have a question with Xaviers proposal	I agree	aa	2
How come you agree	Because therere four sections and they each have two in them	sd	5
Because therere four sections and they each have two in them	Well its kind of hard to explain but I agree	sd	2
Do you want to explain it	So theres four of them	sd	5
So theres four of them	And each of them have two in it and if you put that one block on one of the four so theres that would be four wholes and onehalf because you took a part of it off so theres only one	sd	5
Yeah it took up exactly half of each one of the parts	Yeah	b	1
You mean write it as a mixed number	Yeah	b	1
So youd rather do five divided by what Allaya	That would be one and onehalf	sd	4
Lets do it	Wait but why would the three and the two be threehalves if its not like three	sd	3
Wait but why would the three and the two be threehalves if its not like three	Because the two goes into three once and then three minus two is onehalf	sd	5
Because the two goes into three once and then three minus two is onehalf	Oh	b	1
Oh	So then thats the two in the denominator and one	sd	2
So then thats the two in the denominator and one	All right	aa	1
Allaya is proposing three and a third here	I agree	aa	2
What do you think about that	I have a question	sd	3
Lets hear it	How did you guys got three and onethird	sd	3
Briella do you want to explain it	Yeah but Im not sure if Im correct but	sd	3
Xavier is like his ears  hes totally ready to help you	So that left over square would fit into one of those other squares	sd	5
So that left over square would fit into one of those other squares	Like the one on the left side it would fit in with onethird of that square	sd	5
Like the one on the left side it would fit in with onethird of that square	So it would be three and onethird because it fits into that square and it takes like onethird	sd	5
What do you think about that Xavier	Yeah thats correct	ba	2
So its taking up onethird of a piece	Yeah its not three	sd	5
Yeah its not three	Since theres only one so we only take off onethird of it	sd	5
Yes Sabrina	I dont get this	sd	3
I dont get this	Like if theres a square in between	sd	3
Like if theres a square in between	Well so if theres like dont think of the square doing anything	sd	2
Well so if theres like dont think of the square doing anything	The square doesnt actually matter	sd	2
The square doesnt actually matter	Just imagine you move the pieces all together so theres three still and then you just pick up that one and put it in the spot and then it would still be	sd	5
I just	The gaps in the middle arent anything	sd	4
The gaps in the middle arent anything	Theyre just there	sd	4
Yeah Adeline	So I know you divide it but Im still a little confused	sd	3
So I know you divide it but Im still a little confused	So I dont know why we put the squares in between	sd	3
So I just wanted you guys to see where one is or where two is three	Oh got it	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Lucas did you get your question answered sweetie	Yes	b	1
What do you think Allaya	Would that be twothirds	sd	4
Crew youre doing such a good job understanding what it really means to divide fractions	Theyre kind of easy	sd	1
Were on lesson 3 Will you read the learning intention	fractions of the problem	sd	1
Mia will you read it please	I will know I am successful when I have learned to solve fraction problems	sd	1
Ten to the second power is what Landon	A hundred	aa	4
How do you know	Because it has two zeros	sd	5
How do you know it has two zeros	Because it has I forgot the name	sd	1
Isaac	Six hundred and fifty thousand	sd	4
What is this number	Seventytwo million	sd	4
Avery	The seventy had a zero so when you were writing six	sd	4
Okay so when you have solved this please tell your partner about what you think the answer is and how you would explain that your answer is correct	I used my fraction circles to help me	sd	4
I used my fraction circles to help me	This much	sd	2
Okay so who ate more carrots	Ella	aa	4
Why do you think Ella ate more	Ella ate more because she ate a half of the baby carrots and Jackson only ate a third	sd	5
Ella ate more because she ate a half of the baby carrots and Jackson only ate a third	So a half is way bigger than a third	sd	5
Do you agree with that Isabella	Yes because a half is a fifth bigger than a third	sd	5
Do you agree with Cooper	I respectfully disagree because Ella had 22 baby carrots and Jackson had 36 and half of 22 is 11 and one third of 36 is 12	sd	5
I respectfully disagree because Ella had 22 baby carrots and Jackson had 36 and half of 22 is 11 and one third of 36 is 12	Because 12 plus 12 is 24 plus another 12 is 36	sd	5
Because 12 plus 12 is 24 plus another 12 is 36	So I think Jackson ate more carrots	sd	5
What do you think Landon	I agree with Cooper because Jacksons whole would be bigger because he has more carrots so thats what I think	sd	5
I agree with Cooper because Jacksons whole would be bigger because he has more carrots so thats what I think	And Ella only has 22	sd	5
And Ella only has 22	He has 36	sd	5
Are you listening	I also agree	sd	2
I also agree	Because I divided it by half 22	sd	5
You divided what	I divided 22 in half	sd	4
Because Ella ate 22	And then I divided 36 by 3 and that was 12	sd	5
And then I divided 36 by 3 and that was 12	He ate 12 carrots and Ella ate 11 carrots	sd	5
Is it recording	Yes	b	1
Can you all see Christmas colors on yours	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	I think I do	sd	1
I think I do	Christmas colors	sd	1
You guys want to guess what time I was up until	1130 PM	sd	1
Anna could you read to us please	Its not following me	sd	1
Go for it Anna	The answer is 15	sd	4
Can you talk a little bit louder so that the people know the other side of	The answer is 15 which is the cat and the dog was incorrect because he was	sd	4
Ben can you tell us when you say they counted wrong what do you think they counted wrong	Maybe the odd or evens	sd	4
What do you mean by The odd or evens	Maybe	sd	1
Molly you are actually next do you want to read yours sweetie	Yes	b	1
Yes	I think that the dog made the mistake	sd	5
I think that the dog made the mistake	I think that when the data points are even I think she might have thought that you circled 2 but when theres even usually the median is right between two numbers and its right between 1 and 2 which is 15	sd	5
How many 2s	Three	sd	4
In total Charlotte how many pieces of data do we have	20	b	4
How many would be smaller than the median and how many would be larger	10	b	4
Just so you dont die lets hear your response	What I wrote was that the cat is right with 15 and I think what the dog did was he counted up to 10 and he didnt count the other side like Oh theres ten on this side theres ten on the other side	sd	5
Carson lets hear yours	That is correct and you would have to count to 20 and then he would count that theres how many data points and then he would have to count 10 data points in	sd	5
Okay start over Carson	That is correct and you would have to count to 20 and then he would count that theres how many data points and then he would have to count 10 data points in	sd	5
Isnt that kitty so cute	Shes so cute	sd	1
Shes so cute	Actually it pretty much looks like that	sd	1
All right you ready	This is for Dog	sd	5
This is for Dog	The data is even so you can split it in half so it cant be a solid number and worse its in between like 50 and 50	sd	5
You are saying that we have an even number of data points and we dont have to split them in half	Yes when you split it in half it cant win the honor	sd	5
Yes when you split it in half it cant win the honor	Its like an exact number unless its in between 50 like the same number data	sd	5
Abby might teach us a little French here	I think Cat was right	sd	4
I think Cat was right	Dog did not see the data right	sd	4
Are you going to use your French words for us	No	b	1
Can you tell us what mistake Dog made	It could have been a lot of things	sd	4
It could have been a lot of things	I think  pick the right number between 70 and 75	sd	4
I think  pick the right number between 70 and 75	He stopped at 70	sd	4
What would you like to add Colin	I think the Dog may have calculated it right but didnt know how to calculate the median	sd	4
I think the Dog may have calculated it right but didnt know how to calculate the median	Hes like Hey the median is 70 because its  I think Dog thought Hey the median was 70 but its in between 70 and 75	sd	4
We have how many pieces of data	14	b	4
Crew are you ready to get started today	Yes	b	1
All right	I do wish	sd	1
Look at the agenda	We were on Netflix	sd	1
Crew erase your desk cap your markers put your eyes up here when youre ready to listen	Okay lets do it	sd	1
Our plan for today You guys already know how to find your median correct	Thats right	aa	1
We need a hand signal for mean what should it be	Like this or like	sd	4
That looks like its in the middle	Like this	sd	4
When you look at this dude he is part golfing	What	ba	1
Yes	Oh yes	b	1
As you are watching this video I want you to think about What is the typical number of swings that this golfer needs	Whats his name again	sd	1
What should we call him	Ronald	sd	1
Ronald	Jack	sd	1
Jack	Arnold Palmer	sd	1
Arnold Palmer	Wyatt	aa	1
Arnold Palmer	Mr Bobby	aa	1
Just need to keep it together	Arnold Palmer	sd	1
Arnold Palmer	The ball looks like a little ball	sd	1
Do you guys remember at the beginning when we were talking about average and theres three types of average	Yes	b	1
GoWyatt what did you say whats the mode	2	b	4
How do you know	Because theres three 2s	sd	5
Theres three 2s and no other value happens three times right	Yes	b	1
Maya what do you think that the median is	I think that it is 4 because there is nine total numbers of data and we need to have four numbers on each side you have to put a box here circle on	sd	5
Yes Maggie do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	aa	2
Okay did you have any kind of different strategy	No I used that	sd	2
What your mean would be	Could we use our notebook to like	sd	1
You could write it on your desk if you want to	Should I show my work	sd	1
Okay find your means	Which one	aa	1
Which one	A or B	aa	1
Yes	Which one A or B or all of them	sd	1
thinking right now	I figured it out I think its five	sd	4
Why do you think its five	Because of the histogram	sd	5
The value on the bar graph	Yes and that is what I got	sd	1
Yes and that is what I got	The answer I got was mean	sd	4
Did anybody solve this using an algorithm	I did	sd	1
I did	Oh Lily did	sd	2
Lily what did that look like	What do you mean	qy	3
Tell me what you did to figure it out	I noticed after I did it that it just says it up there but its okay	sd	1
I noticed after I did it that it just says it up there but its okay	I did	sd	4
Okay you had two three times	Yes and then 310	sd	5
Yes and then 310	What I did is for the ones in parenthesis I made a little  9x2 Okay 2x3 is 6	sd	5
I have to write mine up here because I might	Okay 3 is 8 9x2 is 18 10	sd	5
Okay 3 is 8 9x2 is 18 10	Then I did 639 and I did 181028	sd	5
What did you get when you added all those together	I did it one more time	sd	4
Okay	I did 9 Can I do that or should I add	sd	3
No you can tell me now thats fine	I did 981728	sd	5
I did 981728	Then 172845	sd	5
What did you do to find your mean	Theres nine data points so I divided 45 by 9 and I got 5	sd	5
Which of those values over here the mode the median or the mean best represents what kind of golfer Arnold is	I think the mean	sd	4
How come	That is technically the average obviously	sd	4
Is there one number there that you think doesnt represent him as a golfer	The mode	sd	4
Tell us why	He pretty much does it in the first start it wasnt as much of an average	sd	5
Which one better represents Arnold as a golfer	From mode and median	sd	1
From mode and median	I think	sv	1
Sorry out of the median and the mean	Oh the median and the mean	sd	1
Oh the median and the mean	I think the median because the number is lower	sd	5
I think the median because the number is lower	In golf youre trying the lowest score	sd	5
Thats true in golf but do you think that it represents how he is as a golfer	Oh no	ba	1
Oh no	I think the mean represents the	sd	1
How come	Because the mean averages it in a more accurate Why because youre adding all the actual values out but then when youre using the median you use the number of values  represents all of the	sd	5
Do you think there could be times when the mode could best represent the data	Yes	b	1
With mean mean does a better job of taking into account the times when he got much higher scores	Youre supposed to get low scores instead of high scores	sd	1
Youre supposed to get low scores instead of high scores	Oh I thought you wanted to have the high scores	sd	1
Oh I thought you wanted to have the high scores	You want it to take as little time as possible to get your ball intothe The ball into the hole thank you	sd	1
You want it to take as little time as possible to get your ball intothe The ball into the hole thank you	You do not want a nine	sd	1
You do not want a nine	Yes Carson	aa	1
Yes Carson	I think that its good that were using the median	sv	4
Crew lets listen please	because for the That were using the mean because the median just chops off the 10 and the 9 and the other 9and it also chops off the twos so it doesnt see any of his best or his worst and you need to be able to factor those parts in for it to be accurate	sd	5
Whats your evidence for that	I see a few 12s and theres not really that big of data anywhere else other than that one 6th grader with 15	sd	5
Evan what do you notice	That the 6th graders dont watch as many movies as the 7th graders and the 8th graders	sd	4
Whats your evidence	I see that well the 7th graders have  and the 8th graders have twelves	sd	4
That means that theyre watching about three movies a week	Wow	ba	1
Wow	Thats not a lot thats three movies a week	sd	1
Youre going to	I know something	sd	1
Yes what do you know	The 8th graders median is 95	sd	4
Lets see Colin and Abby can you be partners today	Sure	b	1
Ill put the data up here guys so you can see it easier	What were we supposed to say I think	sd	3
Youre going to pick one number	Im sorry Id taken three	sd	1
What did I just say	Use the sixth grade data to create a dot plot for the number of movies watched on Netflix	sd	1
Use the sixth grade data to create a dot plot for the number of movies watched on Netflix	Number of movies watched on Netflix	sd	1
Number of movies watched on Netflix	Yes	b	1
Okay I want you to say I think the typical number is  most is a confusing warning data	You said that it occurs to the right	sd	1
If something happens the most what do we say	Largest range	sd	4
What do you think the typical number is	Im so confused	sd	3
Im so confused	Theres only 14 spots	sd	4
Youre going to have some extras	What	ba	1
Youre going to have some extras	Are you sure	qy	1
Im positive	For 15	sd	1
For 15	Theres two zeros one two it goes blank and then theres three ones so you would color one box in thats one then you see how many times two goes and then say two went three times then youd go up two	sd	5
Theres two zeros one two it goes blank and then theres three ones so you would color one box in thats one then you see how many times two goes and then say two went three times then youd go up two	Theres up to three different typical	sd	5
Theres up to three different typical	What	ba	1
What	Theres both median or mean	sd	4
Say that again I missed what you said	Zoe is saying that mode is typical but Im saying that any of these could be typical	sd	2
Yes any of them but you have to look at them and decide which one of these do I feel like best represents my data	For me I felt that 4 was represented without any of this before I did this I felt that 4 best fit because I looked theres stuff a lot higher than 4 and theres stuff a lot lower than 4	sd	5
For me I felt that 4 was represented without any of this before I did this I felt that 4 best fit because I looked theres stuff a lot higher than 4 and theres stuff a lot lower than 4	So Im going to say around 4 and then it turned out to be the mean so I trust that	sd	5
Good job with this one	Theres not a 4 on anywhere on the data but it doesnt have to be on the data to have to be a mean	sd	4
Theres not a 4 on anywhere on the data but it doesnt have to be on the data to have to be a mean	What happens if theres a gap	sd	3
There shouldnt be a gap	But then how do you connect it	sd	3
But then how do you connect it	Arent they supposed to stay connected	sd	4
So 5 is going to look like this	Okay now that makes sense	sd	1
Okay now that makes sense	Thank you Ms Davies	sd	1
Tell me how you find your	Two 6s	sd	5
Two 6s	Lets see you go over to the 6 twice	sd	5
After you analyzed your data a little bit more do you still feel like 1 is your typical value	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
No	Yes	b	2
Yes	I didnt have one in the first place	sd	4
Your response to number 1	I think the typical number is 4 because it is around the middle	sd	5
Tom do you have something that you want to share	No we were just discussing	sd	1
Okay what were you discussing	I thought it was 4 to start or something like that	sd	4
I thought it was 4 to start or something like that	Yes I thought it was like 3 or 4 and then we decided it was 1	sd	2
So they have a bunch of big plans	Whats the difference between a mayor and a president	sd	1
Where you are guys going to put these black colored sheets	In your current unit	sd	1
Okay someone to tell me how do we write five tenths Regina	You write 05	sd	4
Nine tenths Rosa	09	b	4
Seven tenths Colt	70	b	4
Any decimals in there	07	b	4
Is it okay to have 070	Yes	b	1
23 hundredths Jasper what do you write	I wrote 023	sd	4
Conrad what did you get	I wrote 003	sd	4
Darwin if we wrote 0	Wait hang on I meant Conrad was right	sd	2
What	I meant Conrad is right	sd	2
Ruth what did you write	0 and	sd	4
Alright quick maths of one and 19 hundredths Charlie what did you write	I wrote 1 and nine hundredths	sd	4
You wrote nine hundredths	I wrote 0 and 9 hundredths	sd	4
0 19 is that what you wrote	No without the one	sd	4
Without this one	Yes	b	1
Daxton	so it be 19 instead	sd	4
Forest what did you write	I wrote 8 and 2	sd	4
Kit what did you write	I wrote 450 and 8	sd	4
Everybody agree	No	b	2
Darwins	It would then be tenths not hundredths	sd	4
Good job you guysAlright looking at your math journal let me put this over we are comparing jugglers to tap dancers	We can see clearly	sd	1

Landon what math did you do to figure out how much jugglers cost	I did 3 x 30	sd	5
I did 3 x 30	Sorry I did 2 x 30 and I got 60	sd	5
Can you tell me where you go those two numbers	I got 2 x 30 because two hours of entertainment x the cost per performer and then I did that I got 60	sd	5
I got 2 x 30 because two hours of entertainment x the cost per performer and then I did that I got 60	I did that x 3 which I got 180	sd	5
Why did you do that x 3	Because there is three performers	sd	5
There were follow me	follow me call me	sd	1
Grady how did you do yours	First I did 3 x 30 then I did 90 x 2	sd	5
Okay so you did 30 an hour x the three performers and you got	90	b	4
90 and then you multiplied 90 x 2 because they did that for two hours	Yes	b	1
Did you get 180	Yes	b	1
Does it matter what order you multiply this numbers in	No	b	1
Are we doing three performers x two hours	No	b	1
Whats 6 x 30	180	b	4
Whats 6 x 3	180	b	4
Someone give me Lee give me number model for tap dancers	33 x 4	sd	4
Can you tell me why you did 33 x 2	I did for hours  the cost per performer	sd	4
Okay what did you get when you did 33 x 2	I got 66	sd	4
Okay	Then I did 66 x 6 for the numbers of performers	sd	4
Okay these are six tap dancers	Then I got 397	sd	4
Can you repeat what she	33 x 2 66	aa	5
To try and find	33 an hour	sd	4
Okay and why did she do that x 2	for two hours	sd	4
Then why did she take that and multiply x 6	Because there was	sd	1
Lou what do you do with those two numbers	You divide them	sd	4
Hunter what are you going to do with them	Im going to look at the other number and try and compare how much more it has	sd	4
When you hear how much more what do you think of in your head	I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396	sd	5
I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396	Then I look at the six and theres six and then on top there is nine so that means it has more so I break down the six	sd	5
Are you adding subtracting multiplying dividing what are you doing	So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number	sd	5
So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number	Then thats how much its more	sd	5
Are you adding subtracting multiplying or dividing to figure out how much more	Dividing	aa	4

All right Lee	For the burritos I did should I start with my estimates or my	sd	4
Lets do the actual number model first and then you could talk us through your estimates and then talk us through how you solved it	I wrote 13 x 3 because of the numbers of packages needed and the cost per item	sd	5
Okay so they were 3 per	Yes	b	1
Is this burritos or sandwiches	Burritos	b	4
What else did you do	Then you do x that you do x 8	aa	4
Then you do x that you do x 8	Because the numbers of pieces I get is per package	sd	5
There are eight burritos in a package okay	Then from my estimate I did 10 x 3 because 10 was the  number	sd	5
Okay	That	aa	1

0	9	b	2
Who said nine	Me	b	1
Michael Why is it nine	Because if its in the one its in the ones place	sd	5
So what other sides equal nine	The top	sd	4
The top	Um is it Is it the small box	sd	2
Okay so can we figure out what the inside of this square equals	Yes	aa	1
Yes	yeah	b	2
So what does the inside of this square equal	Nine	sd	4
Nine	nine	sd	2
nine	It equals nine because it is Technically just zero time nine	sd	5
And what is zero times 9		b	4
Are you sure		b	4
	Sorry 0	b	2
Which one should we look at next	Crosstalk	b	1
How would I find what the inside of this square equals	multiplying 50 times nine which equals 450	sd	5
Sarah can you explain how you got that	Which one	aa	1
Which one	how I got the equation or the answer	sd	1
both	I got the equation because I was looking at the numbers	sd	5
I got the equation because I was looking at the numbers	So I knew that it had to be 50 times nine	sd	5
So I knew that it had to be 50 times nine	And how I got the answers	sd	5
And how I got the answers	I did my zeros tricks	sd	5
I did my zeros tricks	I took my zero	sd	5
I took my zero	I put it there and then they multiply five times nine which I knew was 45	sd	5
I put it there and then they multiply five times nine which I knew was 45	Miss you can also count by 5s	sd	2
Do I know	the rectangle that you just drew	sd	4
What are these sides equal to	90 and 50	sd	4
90 and 50	90 and 50	sd	2
The bottom the top or the sides	the bottom	sd	4
Okay	And I think that	sv	1
And I think that	Hold on hold on	sd	1
Hold on hold on	So the bottom is equal to 90 because this side is 90	sd	5
So the bottom is equal to 90 because this side is 90	So that means this side has to be 90	sd	5
Or this side	I think its 50 Because on the other side its also 50	sd	5
So what is this side equal to		b	4
So what is 90 times 0		b	4
		b	2
So what am i multiplying in my final rectangle	90 timesn50	sd	4
90 timesn50	And they already figured out the answer because they its the same strategy they use for the 50 times nine	sd	5
Okay Im going to ask someone then to use Sarah strategy that she showed us earlier with the zeros trick and walk me through how am I going to solve 50 times 90	Using the zeros trick	sd	4
Yep	I know	aa	1
Okay tell me	So um there are two zeros in the equation	sd	5
So um there are two zeros in the equation	And so I put 2 two zeros at the end	sd	5
And so I put 2 two zeros at the end	And then I count by fives nine times and I got 45	sd	5
zero plus zero is	You will get 9000	sd	4
You will get 9000	No youll get 4900 4950	sd	4
All right	I use color	sd	1
Mr  what do you notice	Everything is a square and the smaller the proportions of the body the smaller the	sd	5
Everything is a square and the smaller the proportions of the body the smaller the	I dont know measures	sd	5
So in this unit of measure what is our largest unit of measure were going to be dealing with today when measuring liquid	Gallon	sd	4
What is our smallest Jackson	Our smallest is cup	sd	4
Do you see one of everything up there	Yeah	b	1
You only see one of everything	No	b	1
No	I see on both sides of the hand each side has cup and pint	sd	4
Do we have a mirror image on each side	Yes	b	1
what do you notice	I notice that the smaller ones are more than	sd	4
what do you notice	The numbers keep getting bigger	sd	4
What do you mean	The numbers are getting bigger by how much	sd	4
As we move down this list yes our number goes up but do our sizes go up or down	Up	b	4
Up	No down	aa	2
No down	Down	aa	2
Ricky what about you	Eight	aa	4
Alex	There are 16	sd	4
Maya what pattern do you notice	I notice that 4 times 2 is equal 8 and 8 times 2 is 16	sd	5
Van what do you notice	Its just a question	sd	3
Yep	Is there a measurement smaller than a cup	sd	1
Lets stick to the big ones	I see a pattern that its going quart and	sd	4
Pint	Pint pint cup cup cup	sd	5
Now when you get there you will see something hopefully that looks just like this	Yep	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
How many are there	Two	sd	4
How many pints are there in a quart	Theres two pints in a quart	sd	4
Maya how many	I think theres four	sv	4
In a half a gallon how many quarts would there be	Oh two	ba	4
Three times two	Is six	aa	4
What did you do	Well the first pint I drew	sd	4
Perfect	And then I doubled that two	sd	4
What do you mean you doubled it	And two is doubled one so then I doubled two	sd	5
Mathematically speaking what do you do mathematically to double something	Add that number to itself	sd	4
Whats another way we say that in math	Multiply it	sd	4
Well in this if the pints are doubling so are the	Cups	sd	4
What did you do	times two	sd	4
Im old	Three times two	sd	4
You multiplied three times two	Three times two	sd	4
And that gave you six	Yeah	b	1
Joanna what are we going to do	You have to multiply by two	sd	4
Carrington what are they giving us	Theyre giving us a cup	sd	4
So can we use multiplication Jackson to get this one	Yes	b	1
But yes what are we really using here to solve this one	Division	b	4
Is it still going to be two	Yes	b	1
So Nancy when I divide 16 by 2 what do I get	I think the eight	sd	4
Does this remind you guys of InNOut boxes	Yeah	b	1
So 16 divided by 2 gives us our 8	Eight	sd	1
Whats nine times two		b	4
I got it	What did you need	aa	1
Was trying to figure out how to annotate on that	Oh sorry	b	1
Oh sorry	I was recording	sd	1
Eight cups in a gallon	Im not sure how	sd	3
Huh	I think you  page	sv	1
So this page is shopping for milk	Thank you	aa	1
I know we go through an unimaginable amount of milk every week in my household	Thank you	aa	1
From drinking it to drinking it with cereal	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	Thank you	aa	1
what would you have	Two times eight	sd	4
But do I have a numerator and a denominator	Yes	b	1
Its not a trick	Is it cup	sd	2
What is my denominator	Large or quarts	sd	4
What I have written on the board are those the same thing	Yeah	b	1
Are equivalent fractions the same thing	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	2
Yes	No	b	2
Are those the same thing	No	b	1
No	Well yes	b	2
But what are they	The same amounts	sd	4
Jose say that louder	The same amount	sd	4
But are they the same exact thing	No	b	1
Are these the same	No	b	1
But are they going to give you the same amount	Yes	b	1
Because in this problem when were looking for a small size what is it worth	One cup	sd	4
Which one of those two would you be ordering	The small one	sd	4
Carrington why	Because were trying to figure out how much of the large container is a small container	sd	5
So when it says what fraction of a large container what does that mean the large container must be	On the top	sd	4
On the top	Oh wait	ba	1
Ricky whats something you notice about my picture that I drew over there on the right side of the board	It keeps getting bigger every time	sd	4
Is it random how much its getting bigger	No	b	1
what do you notice about that picture that I just drew	I notice that	sd	1
Maya what do you notice	I notice that for the cup half of it goes into a pint	sd	4
So if I take my cup and I stick it into my pint how much did I fill up	Half	sd	4
Caitlin what do you notice	That the quart	sd	4
You got to talk loud	That the quart if you split it in half it goes into pint	sd	4
Maya what do you notice	That the gallons put into there because its the half because of the quart	sd	5
So how many quarts does it take to fill a gallon	Or four	sd	4
But if we have one we have how much of a gallon	12	b	4
12	14	b	4
A quart is	Half	sd	4
A fourth of a	Gallon	sd	4
Gallon	Or half of a half	sd	4
Now that represents my whole correct	Yeah	b	1
And by definition of a denominate a denominator is the total number of	Parts	sd	4
Parts needed to make	A whole	sd	4
Go	Wait this is 21 fifths	sd	4
Wait this is 21 fifths	Oh	b	1
Oh	Beep beep	sd	1
Beep beep	Owen	sd	1
Owen	Yes we came up with 48 and the blue one was the one that weighed more and it weighed more by 48 but we did a different problem	sd	4
Yes we came up with 48 and the blue one was the one that weighed more and it weighed more by 48 but we did a different problem	What I did was when I saw that 28  I first thought it will be the black ones because I saw all that red and I thought it would be one fraction first for the blue one and I saw except Im reading it and I found that the blue one but I didnt know how many patterns  once more	sd	5
What I did was when I saw that 28  I first thought it will be the black ones because I saw all that red and I thought it would be one fraction first for the blue one and I saw except Im reading it and I found that the blue one but I didnt know how many patterns  once more	So I did my number model and I wasnt sure what type of model I was going to do so I did this first so I can get my answer and know that I could do my model and get the right answer so I do my two and 18 and I subtracted my one and 58 I subtracted by four then five	sd	5
So I did my number model and I wasnt sure what type of model I was going to do so I did this first so I can get my answer and know that I could do my model and get the right answer so I do my two and 18 and I subtracted my one and 58 I subtracted by four then five	Because I know that I can subtract 18 minus 58 so I took one over here then made it eight eights and the  because I can subtract the 58	sd	5
Because I know that I can subtract 18 minus 58 so I took one over here then made it eight eights and the  because I can subtract the 58	I did the same thing with Sebastian I took away one of them to make 28 because  subtract 18 from 58	sd	5
I did the same thing with Sebastian I took away one of them to make 28 because  subtract 18 from 58	This is the blue backpack theres one pound two pounds and one eight minus one pound and five eights and then	sd	5
This is the blue backpack theres one pound two pounds and one eight minus one pound and five eights and then	Shamila whole backpack weighed 10 and 14 pounds	sd	1
Shamila whole backpack weighed 10 and 14 pounds	Before leaving for school she added one subject notebook	sd	1
Before leaving for school she added one subject notebook	Now her backpack weighs 11 pounds how much does the one subject notebook weigh	sd	1
Now her backpack weighs 11 pounds how much does the one subject notebook weigh	The first thing that I did was I did  then I did minus 10	sd	4
The first thing that I did was I did  then I did minus 10	Yes	b	1
Yes	because we already had 11	sd	5
because we already had 11	No  so I started off with 10 and 14 because I  off with and then I looked at it and I thought it was one then I worked with 1 and 34 because I was just added up like yours I got 11	sd	5
No  so I started off with 10 and 14 because I  off with and then I looked at it and I thought it was one then I worked with 1 and 34 because I was just added up like yours I got 11	Well I realized that it was wrong to me  because that wasnt cool	sd	4
Well I realized that it was wrong to me  because that wasnt cool	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	I did  and one was minus 10 one was because 11 people say  and then	sd	5
I did  and one was minus 10 one was because 11 people say  and then	When mine is 11 we took the one and made it 44	sd	4
When mine is 11 we took the one and made it 44	That its much easier to	sd	1
That its much easier to	Once you notice that you have ten	sd	4
Once you notice that you have ten	Not on the	sd	1
Maddy will let you write your name	Yeah it will	sd	1
Could you turn your microphone on	Yes	b	1
go ahead	Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	sd	5
Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	And they each need to get the same amount	sd	5
And they each need to get the same amount	So if I divide if like I give each rabbit or like the six carrots goes into the rabbits twice I guess I	sd	5
What did your expression look like	So first I did 8 divided by two plus three	sd	5
Why did you do eight divided by two buddy	Nevermind	sd	1
Yeah can you	Yeah	b	1
Go ahead rogan	Okay so I was a little confused on this one	sd	3
Okay so I was a little confused on this one	But I said four divided by two plus three	sd	5
Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on	Hello	sd	1
Can you walk them through this	Yes	b	1
Yes	So can I explain what I did	sd	1
So can I explain what I did	And then walk them through it	sd	1
Please do because I need to make sure youre correct	Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	sd	5
Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	So you do that first	sv	5
So you do that first	And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	sd	5
And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	So you need to do that first	sv	5
So you need to do that first	And then he has three cages	sd	5
And then he has three cages	So I did two plus four in parentheses divided by three	sd	5
because you had to divide those rabbits into	Three cages	sd	4
Landon turn your microphone back on	Okay	b	1
Tell me what Maddy just said	She said that she did in parentheses four plus two which is six and then shes did six divided by three which is inauidble	sd	5
Does that make sense Landon	Yeah	b	1
What Maddy did	Yes	b	1
Where did you come up with 8 buddy	inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	sd	5
inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	So now Im actually solving it	sd	5
So now Im actually solving it	I dont know where I got eight from	sd	3
Turn your microphone on please	Yes	b	1
Tell me what how you solved this	I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds	sd	4
John can you explain what you did	Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds	sd	4
How can you cut it into thirds John	Well inauidble And I said each person could get 13 of the pizza	sd	4
Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on	You can cut them both into thirds	sd	4
ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much	Two thirds	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Can you turn your microphone on buddy	Yeah	b	1
So Ethan how did you solve this	I did it	sd	1
I did it	I split to six graham crackers in half	sd	5
I split to six graham crackers in half	And then so each of them got on one and one half of two graham crackers	sd	5
Kate do you agree or disagree with that	Well I did it differently	sd	2
Okay so explain what you did please	Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	sd	5
Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	Because there were three people or three friends	sd	5
Because there were three people or three friends	Oh I would have to cut it into fourths	sd	5
What does that come up with	At first I did it in third	sd	5
At first I did it in third	When I did it in thirds	sd	5
When I did it in thirds	I got two wholes	sd	5
I got two wholes	They would each get two wholes	sd	5
They would each get two wholes	But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	sd	5
But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	Because I need to do her two	sd	5
Because I need to do her two	So they would each get one and a half	sd	5
So they would each get one and a half	So yeah now I agree	aa	2
Kate what	Its number five	sd	1
Are you gonna work with me	Ill work with you	sd	1
So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between	Oh god	ba	1
Oh god	Um three	sd	4
What about Mary	Three	sd	4
So we have three total people right	Yeah	b	1
Right	Yup	aa	1
Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here	Uh you could draw  pizza slices maybe and you split it into thirds	sd	4
Adam how much pizza did each person get	A third	sd	4
So if it would make it easier I could do 13	plus 13 plus 13	sd	4
That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam	three thirds or a whole	sd	4
What question Can I clarify	I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	sd	1
I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	I was just saying kinda cause	sd	1
I was just saying kinda cause	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	I forgot to add the person whos like the first person	sd	4
What How am I cutting them into fractions	circles	sd	4
Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can	One and a half	sd	4
I have my five cans right	three cans	sd	4
What am I dividing those cans into	Thirds	sd	4
Why third	Mrs Strathom I know	sd	1
What do I need to divide these cans into	fifths	aa	4
fifths	Fifths	aa	2
Audrey	because shes gone for five days	sd	5
Three what Everybody	Three fifteenths	sd	4
Three fifteenths	cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each	sd	5
How many days Is she going to be gone Adam	three fifths	sd	4
cameras on	If we didnt Finish Do we finish it for asynchronous	sd	1
camera on camera on camera on camera Camera on Camera on	Mom I still have a question	sd	3
Whats your question Adam	So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something	sd	5
Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get	three fifths	sd	4
make sense	Yeah	b	1
And if your camera doesnt go on I did not know youre with me	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes	They probably still have you muted	sd	1
Now what some people did as a as a answer is if two boxes is six centimeters how many centimeters is one box	Three	sd	4

What would be this last angle here		b	4
Well can we simplify the first one to	43rds	sd	4
What did you divide by	By five	sd	4
Whats one of the most useful types of angles in these problems	Right angle	b	4
Starts with a V	vertical angle	sd	4
So Does everyone agree this is the same as this	Yeah	b	1
Out of these three Which one do we have	Angle angle	sd	4

Did you guys solve with the same way	Yes I have	sd	2
Did you get the same answer Miles	Yes	b	2
Does anybody know how to do a partial product with the second one	No one	sd	1
Has anybody tried it out	I tried it and I didnt even get the	sd	1
Ill try it again	Okay	b	1
All right James	I got 600 because	sd	5
I got 600 because	30 x 20 is 600	sd	5
30 x 20 is 600	Okay 3 x 2 is 6 and then I add the two zeros	sd	5
Okay 3 x 2 is 6 and then I add the two zeros	I got 80 by 20 x 4 which is 80	sd	5
I got 80 by 20 x 4 which is 80	Then 0 x 4 is 0 and 0 x 30 is 0 and then I got 60	sd	5

Everybody say Decompose	Decompose	sd	1
What do you think Jaden	We used two strategies	sd	4
We used two strategies	It was column addition and then the partition rectangles	sd	4
This is column addition making sure we add up everything correctly and have them lined up but what really is this	The partial product	sd	4
Look here everybody say 30 x 20	30 x 20	sd	1
Whats 30 x 8	240	b	4

That s what I explained	They didn t look all correct	sd	1
No	30 x 20	sd	4
Can you draw your partition rectangle	Yes	b	1
You can add on you can justify your answer you can revise your thinking all right go	On the six here what I think he did wrong is that he got to do	sd	1
Doing that one	There are two right	sd	4
There are two right	I said that they re correcting	sd	1
Do you want to come over and talk with this group	I agree with you because  agree with	sd	2
I agree with you because  agree with	You could just add on to this	sd	4

Maybe share the star of what you starred here	What I starred was I meant most about this part I starred there	sd	4
Why did you star that	I starred that because I feel like I did the explaining and everyone in my group did it pretty close explanation	sd	5
Can you share what you thought the mistake was	I thought the mistake was him leaving out the zeros and three because he did 3 x 20 and there s no 3	sd	5
I thought the mistake was him leaving out the zeros and three because he did 3 x 20 and there s no 3	There s a 30 and a 30	sd	5
He said three was just	Three	sd	1
Is it in the ones place	No	b	1
Does everybody agree with Mason on that point	Yes	b	2
Maybe you have something else to share	Also that the three and the 20 should be 30 x 20	sd	2
James I see that you didn t put your partition rectangle but what did you do here	I did the partial products	sd	4
Who did a partition rectangle that they want to share	I did	sd	1
What	I did a partition rectangle	sd	1
Anybody think something Charlotte can you come up and share what you were thinking	Yes but it doesn t have a partition rectangle	sd	1
Can you explain	The three and the times 20 is wrong because they re supposed to be zeros and not just a plain old three	sd	5
The three and the times 20 is wrong because they re supposed to be zeros and not just a plain old three	It s supposed to be a zero and a 20	sd	5
It s supposed to be a zero and a 20	I found that same thing with 30 and eight	sd	5
Awesome give Charlotte a power clap one two three clap	I just saw something on her work and it said it s eight in the one s place but it had 80	sd	2

Thank you All right we got the cat yay	Yeah Moshis here	aa	1
Daphne	Yes	b	1
Yes	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	I forgot we had to type in	sd	1
I forgot we had to type in	Im sorry	sd	1
Okay so Katie What do you think	Well I put the zero and then the five	sd	5
Well I put the zero and then the five	And then like obviously its going to be by ones on the X	sd	5
And then like obviously its going to be by ones on the X	And I put the 10 was zero	sd	5
And I put the 10 was zero	And then the zero and the five	sd	5
And then the zero and the five	And then well I cant go by ones because its not a lot of room	sd	5
And then well I cant go by ones because its not a lot of room	So then I was thinking why not twos	sd	5
A Go ahead Daphne when you write	Sorry do you want me to	sd	1
Sorry do you want me to	Oh y equals 10 over 5x plus 10	sd	4
Okay	Oh two over one	sd	4
But remember its negative because the lines going down	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thank you	aa	1
What was the first thing we did	Marked like an x one and a y one	sd	4
I dont know if anyone is looking at my video on here but I was probably super scared when that happened	I saw it	sd	1
Which one do you want to do	The first one	sd	1
Be respectful polite and focused	Why dont you do the other one then	sd	2
Why dont you do the other one then	That was easy	sd	1
That one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Multiply the bottom of the other side so then you end up getting that  and then divide it on both sides you should get	sd	5
What	You tell me if this is wrong	sd	1
You tell me if this is wrong	I just multiplied it to the top and then multiplied to the other side so I canceled that one out and then multiplied it to that side	sd	5
Make sure youre nice to him if he makes mistake	Im not that smart I guess pretty much	sd	1
Im not that smart I guess pretty much	I knew that it has zero as in the three and threehalves	sd	5
I knew that it has zero as in the three and threehalves	I knew it couldnt be A and it couldn t be B so I said it was D	sd	5
Tell me why you narrowed it down from A and B	Because the zeros dont show up Well for this one the three was outside the  so thats not a zero	sd	5
Because the zeros dont show up Well for this one the three was outside the  so thats not a zero	I crossed that one out and then math never gives things to you this nicely so I crossed one out and between these two I guessed  Educated guess	sd	5
Coin flip	Yes	b	1
Okay	Well I don t know	sd	1
Well I don t know	I had something that was telling me to do that  little hunch	sd	1
I had something that was telling me to do that  little hunch	Poll	sd	2
Anyone who disagrees	Youre lucky	sd	1
No its not Or Else	Its On Every Problem Every Time Seriously	sd	4
Its On Every Problem Every Time Seriously	Just do it	sd	1
Just do it	You got that one	sd	1
If this is you	But I cant factor	sd	1
Really what I want you to do is get it down and understand the math	Hi this is a message to Mr C I just wanted to say that Liam says he s the bait master	sd	1

No math	Hi guys	sd	1
Having that feeling now on	Hello I m Mia	sd	1
Hello I m Mia	And so	sd	1
Take another like two or three minutes and make sure you are a 100 expert at these basic skills on this quiz before I move on	Okay	b	1
Okay	So right now we re supposed to be looking for quizzes but But yes	sd	1
So right now we re supposed to be looking for quizzes but But yes	And I see no questions	sd	1
And I see no questions	We re talking about optical illusion	sd	1
We re talking about optical illusion	Ooh  has a real question	aa	1
Ooh  has a real question	That was Mia back to	sd	1
That was Mia back to	No we ll  to Mia s question	sd	1
for a couple of minutes	Okay we have to pay attention now	sd	1
This was the best Ive ever seen a class do on this quiz so thats good	Apparently we re smart	sd	1
Today feels better right	Yes	b	1
Is it low or is it high	High	aa	4
Everybody agree with that	Yes	b	1
No why cant it be there	The vertical line and the X would be Thered be no line across the axis	sd	5
Who wants to volunteer for this one	Ill do it	sd	1
Okay give us some logic and some justification	This only  with the dot	sd	4
This only  with the dot	The other side same thing  goes on the middle	sd	4
Wait you just did an illegal move you cant cross the horizontal asymptote	Yes you can	sd	4
I got five The reason why Im hitting this again is I got like five people during that little work time who were telling me that you couldnt cross the horizontal	Thats why theres a tape on his clicker	sd	1
Thats why theres a tape on his clicker	That was a ninja move right there	sd	1
That was a ninja move right there	Yes	b	1
I get people doing this kind of thing and then theyll go	No	b	1
You failed the function test right	You failed	sd	1
You failed	You failed life	sd	1
You failed life	You failed life	sd	1
I need this to be right so when I close these lines it doesnt	I made an adjustment okay	sd	4
I made an adjustment okay	It s all	sd	1
Watch please	intercepts so I did a	sd	4
intercepts so I did a	That failed the test	sd	2
Where does it live on the right side of the asymptote	Then theres no evidence that its over here	sd	4
The slanted line	The oblique	sd	4
Who wants to volunteer	Spin the wheel	sd	1
That that is a common mistake	I think you need to do that a dozen more times	sv	4
All right watch	This is the easy part the line has to go through there	sd	4
This is the easy part the line has to go through there	The line has to be part of that	sd	4
Is this supposed to be going away from that asymptote like that	What is happening	sd	3
What is happening	You get the point Im not an artist	sd	1
You get the point Im not an artist	No you get the point	sd	1
No you get the point	Then here theres no evidence that the line crosses the X so the line has to go down and back up	sd	5
Then here theres no evidence that the line crosses the X so the line has to go down and back up	It has to cross the X because theres a dot right there so I hypothesize the line comes up and goes along here like that	sd	5
Is this coming back down now towards	Towards the X but never touching	sd	4
Wow that was horrible thats not even any better than yours	That looks worse	sd	1
Were almost done with this phase of	Hi SCU researchers were back again	sd	1
Hi SCU researchers were back again	If you made it this far into our recording can you please add our Snap so we know who you are my Snap is AIDENAI01	sd	1
If you made it this far into our recording can you please add our Snap so we know who you are my Snap is AIDENAI01	Noahs is	sd	1
Noahs is	I dont know by memory Aiden	sd	1
I dont know by memory Aiden	Noahs Snapchat is NBIGHOUSE2019 and Mias is MIAREESE11 thank you bye	sd	1
Math chat not Snapchat	Right	b	1
Right	Did you get good audio today	sd	1
The thing is you doing it out of order right	Do what	sd	3
What does this say	Yes yes	b	1
Yes yes	Sorry my bad	sd	1
Sorry my bad	My mistake	sd	1
All right guys you can start getting things cleaned up	So when you re finding Xintercepts and these both cancel would it just be zero	sd	4
So when you re finding Xintercepts and these both cancel would it just be zero	And that is just	sd	1
Just a straight line because there s no just continuities  in the denominator other than a hole right	Yes	b	1
Asymptote	Does it have to cross the hole	sd	4
So you have still plug that holein figure out the	But then how do you get	sd	3
The hole doesn t have to be at the xaxis	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Into Negative 15	sd	4
You plug the hole in there you get  looks like that	So you want xintercept yintercept  horizontal asymptote	sd	4
For this one the  behavior is a  what has the relative figure power numerator versus denominator	So if the	sd	1
If the denominator wins it s a horizontal asymptote of zero	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Right	b	1
Right	I dont have the	sd	1
I dont have the	Why dont you get up	sd	1
Go ahead and find it	Chucky	sd	1
Chucky	They all have	sd	1
It looks like	arent you suppose turn that in	sd	1
This is Thursdays	why does it always happen to me	sd	1
So actually you guys could work on this	I already did it	sd	1
Where is it	I dont have it	sd	1
I dont have it	I said theres	sd	1
For instance for ATT when they charge three cents per text message if I send two text messages how much am I spending	six cents	sd	4
If I send one text message with ATT how much does it cost	No dollars	sd	4
No dollars	Three cents	sd	2
Three cents but if I send one text message with Verizon how much does it cost	Twenty dollars and one cent	sd	4
Serena	if you were at Verizon when theres 1500 to 2500 texts and its cheaper at ATT where its zero to 500 text theyre the same at a thousand texts	sd	5
If youre someone who sends a lot of texts this is not the cellphone company for you	Is this is per month	sd	4
Ian	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	ATT is the first one	sd	4
Up this one	We cant find our paper	sd	1
We cant find our paper	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	Weve looked everywhere	sd	1
Really today I wanted to get to 33 on top of that so lets pull that out	The Wild World	sd	1
Should I reread this right here	Yes	b	1
Ian	Well if you have 100 points and for every ride that you take that it gives your card more	sv	4
Whats happening to your card	Its taking away money	sd	4
Its taking away not money	Points	sd	4
What is it doing	Taking six points away	sd	4
Taking six points away	Taking	aa	2
What am I taking away	Twelve	sd	4
So 7 to 10 how many rides have I taken	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
How many points is that off	Ten	sd	4
Ten	Oh no	ba	1
Does everyone see how I got 30 here	Yes	b	1
Howd you get 16	Because were at 15 rides and you have 10 but if you subtract six its four	sd	5
Because were at 15 rides and you have 10 but if you subtract six its four	Thats not enough for that ride	sd	5
Have I used all my points	Yes	b	1
No	Actually you cant buy another ride	sd	4
For this Im really just looking for a general sentence thats like What are we doing when were solving for any number of rides	We subtract six points every time you go on a ride	sd	4
Slim	A hundred	aa	4
A hundred what	Points	sd	4
When youre thinking about creating an equation wheres your shoe	I have	sd	1
We could say well Ian	I just want to edit  otherwise well just go and well be like Okay a hundred rides	sd	4
How would we create part of a yes	Youre sure to say it	sd	1
You said N is the whats N	Number of rides	sd	4
P equals	Points left	sd	4
Because now were in the land of multiplication is a variable sign symbol	You could just take away the X and	sd	4
Points	E  6	sd	4
What part of this whole	E  6 to R E  6  R	sd	4
What part of the equation shows the number of bonus points at the start	A hundred	aa	4
A hundred	Uhoh	b	1
What do you think Serena	I think the points left is dependent and the number of rides is independent because I mean the number of rides is just like you just go around how many times you want	sd	5
I think the points left is dependent and the number of rides is independent because I mean the number of rides is just like you just go around how many times you want	It doesnt depend on anything	sd	5
It doesnt depend on anything	The points on the card and  and all that depends on how many rides youre on	sd	5
If my N is zero wheres my points left	A hundred	aa	4
So think as rides increase whats happening to your points that are left	Should I write it down here and then the point outside	sd	1
You got it	It only goes straight up	sd	4
I love that youre challenging yourself with that but its picking up a whole another layer that we can discuss	Can I go change my binder	sd	1
Can I go change my binder	I have to be	sd	1
All your stuff that you need	Yes	b	1
Very good	Like this	sd	1
Hell help you	and then you just write it	sd	1
Yes well really I just wanted you to draw the relationship and just think about	This is good then	sd	1
Its great but I wasnt looking for that specific just a general Hey what would happen to the line	Oh so just	sd	1
Did you go out at lunch	Yes	b	1
Was it warmer	Yes	b	1
I just dont like the breezing	Is it okay if I go	sd	1
Did you get a cut here or is it	Yes	b	1
Not inside	I was probably kicking around on the street  I turned my head and I see a huge ice ball coming to my face	sd	1
I was probably kicking around on the street  I turned my head and I see a huge ice ball coming to my face	It hurt so bad	sd	1
Gryphon what are you doing	Im watching this piece of metal	sd	1
Yes	I have a question for you	sd	1
Yes	right now	b	1
Do you	For that cheese	sd	1
Youve got cheese	No but we cant If I had to I wouldve guessed	sd	1
As I go this way as the number of rides that Ive taken increases what would I expect to happen to my number of points left	Decreasing	sd	4
You guys in back totally thought about this and I love it is that when I have zero points left how many rides have I taken	Eighteen	sd	4
Eighteen	Fifteen	sd	2
Thank you for really asking	Can we stay in here	sd	1
How many minutes would you guys like to examine these equations	Do we need to write it down	sd	1
That would probably be helpful	Okay	b	1
Set a timer for three minutes	Okay three minutes and counting	sd	1
Okay three minutes and counting	Should we  them	sd	1
You can do whatever you would like to do to solve them its totally up to you	Are we solving them right now	sd	1
Emmie	Oh Sorry	b	1
Or do you have a question about one of these that you would like to answer	So I think that number one is true	sv	4
Okay	And I think that number two is false	sd	4
Number one or number two	Number two	sd	4
So you think number two is false	Yes	b	1
Can you tell us why you think its false	I think its false because a tenth times 20 would be 20 fifths	sd	5
Okay	And therefore its 10 is 24 would be 24 fourths which would theyre not be equal	sd	5
Can you help me	Actually its 20 fifths is equal to four wholes	sd	5
Okay	And 24 fourths is equal to six wholes	sd	5
And when we simplify those theyre no longer equal	Yeah	b	1
Or ask a question	I didnt understand this or get it or I just put randomly but I feel the first one might be true	sd	4
Can you tell us why you think the first one might be true	Well I trying to just guess and pick randomly	sd	1
Well I trying to just guess and pick randomly	At first I picked false though	sd	4
Sorry did you say true or false for number one	True	aa	4
So I can help you with this one	How would you go about solving that or finding out if its true or false	sd	3
Does that make sense how I got that part	So itd be just divided by	sd	4
Thered be five groups of nine	Oh okay	b	1
What would that be equal to	45 fifths	sd	4
Its 45 fifths but we can simplify it into a whole number	So you would just divide	sd	4
What times five is 45	So nine	sd	4
So now both sides of your equation equal nine right	Yeah	b	1
What followup questions do you have Giana	I dont have any thank you though	sd	1
What would you like to tackle	I would like to identify the one that is true	sd	4
Okay which ones true do you think	The third one that one	sd	4
Okay tell us why you think this one is true	Because the numbers are just switching around and in regular multiplication	sd	5
Because the numbers are just switching around and in regular multiplication	For example if you multiply seven times six and you said 42 and six times seven would be 42 so I think they have both same	sd	5
So its true because of the commutative property	Can I have the last one	sd	1
All right Im all ready girl	Yeah so I think its true	sv	4
Okay	Because 486 is just equal to 486 over 12	sd	5
Because 486 is just equal to 486 over 12	And then when you add 480 plus six its 486	sd	5
Oftentimes keep going	these tiny cans and then they  bigger cans	sd	1
Travis where do you think four came from	I think you just add it on the blue paint to the yellow paint	sd	4
Theyre very small quantities by the way	What are they painting	sd	1
What would you be painting with milliliters do you think	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Maybe a  pot	sd	1
A pot	Pottery or something	sd	1
Something very small	Maybe  painting for a small picture frame like final canvas	sd	1
Do I see anything in the room that has maroon	Well maybe on that bag theres a maroon	sd	1
And this is your recipe for maroon paints right	Should we write the picture down	sd	1
What could we multiply in our ratio table	Times two	sd	4
Hunter can you tell us one way that we could get to 15 milliliters of red paint	Would you add right	aa	4
Well Im going to say we cant add five but we can add column one for sure	Oh okay	b	1
Travis how else do you think we can do this	Well we could multiply the first column by three	sd	4
Do we have a way that we can easily get from eight to 80	Yeah	b	1
What would we multiply by	10	b	4
So looking at this Charlie what is one of our parts	The kids wearing sneakers	sd	4
What was the ratio	Five to six	sd	4
Five to six	So I guess five	sd	4
What is our other part Hunter	Boots	b	4
Wayne what is one of our parts in this problem today	One of the parts	sd	1
What is one of the things were comparing	So were comparing three parts of oil with two parts of soy sauce	sd	4
So oil is one of our parts	And then were also doing one part probably of orange juice and 42 cups of marinade	sd	4
So with oil soy sauce OJ	And marinade	sd	4
So this is our part part part whole	Yeah	b	1
Hunter what could we multiply to get our marinade up to 42	We could multiply it by seven	sd	4
All right see you later	I wish  more time	sd	1
What is the only thing theyre doing here Missy	The only thing that theyre doing is 2X36 and	sv	4
What are they doing to both	Theyre basically	sd	1
TimJudyng it or multiplying it	Multiplying it	sd	4
Timesing or multiplying	Multiplying	sd	4
What is this thing called	Denominator	aa	4
I got my common denominator by doing it 5 times 3 equals		b	4
I want to know what you know	How many	sd	1
How many	What	ba	1
What	How many	sd	1
Give me 3	Okay	b	1
Okay	Im not done yet	sd	1
Im not done yet	Im not done	sd	1
Im not done	Cover you	sd	1
Friends if you know how to do this you should be done	Yes	b	1
Okay	Im not	sd	1
Kurt whats the first one you did to find an equivalent fraction	I cancelled the 2	sd	4
Franc whats 3 times 2		b	4
Whats 7 times 2		b	4
Franc if I use 2 here what should I use here		b	4
Im going to do	Three sevenths	sd	4
Three sevenths	Three sevenths	sd	2
Three sevenths	3 times 3	sd	4
3 times 3	Times 3	sd	2
Im going to do 7 times 3 and what does that equal		b	4
Im going to do 3 times 3 equals		b	4
Missy what is 7 times 4		b	4
Whats 7 times 4 everybody		b	4
	Done	b	1
What is 3 times 4		b	4
Kurt are all those equivalent fractions	Yes	b	1
Do I guess keep going up	Yes	b	1
Do I do three sevenths and then I do	Times 5	sd	4
3 times 5		b	4
Whats 7 times 5 everybody		b	4
Whats 3 times 5 everybody		b	4
Did my fraction ever change of what I was multiplying	No	b	1
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
Lets do 1 4	Yes	b	1
One right	Thats wonderful	sd	1
Thats wonderful	You said we do 2 3 or 3 what	sd	3
I need 3 equivalent fractions yes	Stand when we finish	sd	1
If thats got embedded it in your brain	Ill make sure I get this one	sd	1
Ill make sure I get this one	Yes	b	1
Yes	I guess you	sd	1
Two thirds and you should do it the exact same way I did that	Yes Im trying	sd	1
Go	I got one	sd	4
I got one	I got one	sd	2
I got one	Saying lets go she cant get	sd	1
Saying lets go she cant get	I did	sd	1
I did	Help me to save all these answers	sd	1
Help me to save all these answers	If you got the	sd	1
Dont get upset	Im going to	sd	1
Im going to	Wait	sd	1
Wait	So youd know	sv	1
Open up your Oh did you guys agree	Yes	b	2
This is what you call	Do we have to erase	sd	1
Any questions	No	b	1
Clay why did you tell Kaylee to come outside	I did not	sd	1
Did Roberto walk over to you and said please walk outside	No I didnt	sd	1
I want you to think about Oh hello what are you doing over there babe	It was connected to your seat when you walked out and then it just like that I think	sd	1
So it would be five	But its a fraction not a whole number	sd	4
What did you just say	Its still a fraction not a whole number	sd	4
What are you saying Mariah youre looking at me youre going what	Its going to be the same youre just switching the spots	sv	4
So now being able to look at a question Gerogia rather than saying Im still confused why dont you listen	Okay	b	1
We have a collection box down here and were going to start with looking at their process okay	Oh like it	sd	1
Let me give you some think time	Can we do it in decimals	sd	4
Are we working on decimals	No	b	1
Give me a way	One and one half	sd	4
Nope thats one and a half	A whole	sd	4
Gabby	Two halves	sd	4
Marco	Two twos	sd	4
Oh	Two halves	sd	4
Does	God two halves	sd	4
two twos	Wow yes	b	1
equal one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thats yes	aa	1
Thats 22 thats one	Two twos	sd	4
What else	Three threes	sd	4
Three threes	going to do this	sd	1
going to do this	Four fours	sd	4
Four fours	Five fives	sd	4
Five fives	Wow	ba	1
I didnt ask for something to be added together	No	b	1
Dont they	They are	sd	4
What are 3 fractions that are equivalent to one friends	22 33 44	b	4
Those are your answer for the first one	Wow	ba	1
Now in order to have a whole what do my numerator and denominator have to be	Theyre the same	sd	4
Theyre the same	Equal	b	2
Equal	Its equal	sd	2
The same	Same	sd	1
Theyll have to be the same	Same both	sd	1
Do a quick turnandtalk to your neighbors please	Oh he doesnt have	sd	1
Oh he doesnt have	Because you have an alternative	sd	4
Because you have an alternative	I think it makes sense because like three thirds is one whole and two halves is one whole because its one whole	sd	5
I think it makes sense because like three thirds is one whole and two halves is one whole because its one whole	If I have a number line and if it goes up one then it goes up to one	sd	5
Great	which is also one like two halves or four quarters its going to be the same thing	sd	4
which is also one like two halves or four quarters its going to be the same thing	I was thinking like	sd	1
Missy youre explaining this to me	Oh my oh	ba	1
Where youre talking about it	Yes	b	1
Im going to let him explain what you were talking about	Can you tell me	sd	2
Big voice please so everyone can hear	It means two are  are equal one whole	sd	4
How do that denominator and numerator equal one whole	Oh my God	ba	1
Oh my God	Because of	sd	1
Gerogia	The numerator and the denominator have to be the same	sd	4
Why that	Well they have to be the same because if they werent the same like say like four fifths that it will be close to a whole but not a whole	sd	5
JulGabbya	If like Mariah said we have a fraction so a quarter	sd	2
Okay go ahead	Like Mariah said if we put a fraction its closer	sd	5
Like Mariah said if we put a fraction its closer	If weve 44 and its a whole	sd	5
If weve 44 and its a whole	Wholes if you put them together we do all four pieces and 44 top of if or like a whole	sd	5
Wholes if you put them together we do all four pieces and 44 top of if or like a whole	I hope someone can add on that	sd	1
Friends what would you like to add on	Well if writing a number line and the number line when it has like 12 for example one half or whole because a whole on a number line is one whole which is also two halves	sd	5
Well if writing a number line and the number line when it has like 12 for example one half or whole because a whole on a number line is one whole which is also two halves	But I was trying to say that	sd	2
This was something that as a child I didnt understand	Thats	ba	1
That was the whole I was trying to make up	Oh it was like a whole	sd	4
Im going to give you an option	But	sd	1
Christoph partner or me	You	aa	1
Art Gerald come sit at the table	Im fine	sd	1
Im fine	There you are	sd	1

What do you think Christoph	If you multiply 45	aa	4
Im going to do Missy is that what Im going to do	Yes	b	2
Hold your paper up until everyone is done	With the denominator of 12	sd	4
With the denominator of 12	Before we came I would write the fraction by their names	sd	1
Before we came I would write the fraction by their names	How	aa	3
How	Oh because your number is 6 of	sd	4
Oh because your number is 6 of	Yes fraction names from one	sd	2
Yes fraction names from one	It would have to be 33 because we have to make the denominator	sd	5
Everybody got it	4x312 and 3x39	sd	5
4x312 and 3x39	This one would have to be two right	sd	4
This one would have to be two right	For the denominator	sd	4
What is 4x3	4x3	b	1
4x3		b	4
Okay and whats 5x3		b	4
Dianna what did you get for the very last one	is I did 4x4 is 16	sd	5
Gerogia what are you doing	You are multiplying them	sd	4
Say it to what	One whole	sd	4
Isnt it like that	Yes	b	1
So I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	Can you repeat that	sd	1
I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	Is it	sd	1

Go	So I did is you showed the two tenths	sd	5
So I did is you showed the two tenths	So I did that once	sd	5
So I did that once	And then I did it another time	sd	5
And then I did it another time	So twice and then three times and then four times and then five times and then six times	sd	5
So twice and then three times and then four times and then five times and then six times	And then to help me I did it different colors	sd	5
And then to help me I did it different colors	So that I know that it was six times	sd	5
So that I know that it was six times	And then I labeled up here	sd	5
And then I labeled up here	I said that that was one whole and down here theres 210 and then I added those together and I got I got one one and 210	sd	5
Explain that please	Because it was filling the whole entire 100 like 100ths or 10ths	sd	5
You are up next	I did pretty much the same thing as Kate	sd	2
I did pretty much the same thing as Kate	I knew that	sd	1
I knew that	You did one or two tenths with us	sd	5
You did one or two tenths with us	And then I did another one	sd	5
And then I did another one	So that was two and then three four or five and then sick	sd	5
So that was two and then three four or five and then sick	And then like Kate said this whole 100 block is filled up with colors	sd	5
And then like Kate said this whole 100 block is filled up with colors	So I know that thats one whole	sd	5
Okay thank you	And go ahead Maddy show us what youve done	sd	5
And go ahead Maddy show us what youve done	So what Ive done is so each of these boxes are worth 100	sd	5
So what Ive done is so each of these boxes are worth 100	And so I have two of these is two tenths	sd	5
And so I have two of these is two tenths	So in there needed to be six of them	sd	5
So in there needed to be six of them	So I did 12345 and then six down here	sd	5
So I did 12345 and then six down here	And so I knew like they did that this was one whole	sd	5
And so I knew like they did that this was one whole	So thats how when where I put the one and then I saw that there was two tenths left so that I put the two	sd	5
Can you turn your microphone on	Yes	b	1
Explain the reasoning that youre missing on this okay	Im not really getting the like adding	sd	3
Do you understand how to color in the 10th part	Yeah	b	1
Haley while Zachs talking put your things up please	I used graph paper	sd	4
Great but how did you section that graph paper off	Yeah	b	1
Can you explain how you	Its initially 11 by 11	sd	4
Its initially 11 by 11	So	sd	1
Help me	Um so what Landon is not getting is like when you do like zero I dont really remember the problem	sd	3
It was two tenths times six	Okay it was two tenths	sd	1
Okay it was two tenths	So he um hes not adding correctly	sd	2
So he um hes not adding correctly	Like when you go over by ten youre supposed to add like one	sd	5
123	184 thousandths	sd	1
Or can you only see my screen	I can see a little bit of your board	sd	1
So Im going to start	I can see the top of your board	sd	1
So I know that seven times three equals what Landon	21	b	4
That I have up here that I dont have down here	A decimal point	sd	4
So Landon do you know a way I can move the decimal or figure out how to bring the decimal to where I need it	Yeah	b	1
Explain it please	Since were multiplying you have to move it to the right	sd	5
I have to move it one right there correct	Yeah	b	1
Could I also have just brought it down in this instance	Yes	b	1
Two and 110	Yes	b	1
Turn your microphone on please	Hello	sd	1
Tell me what you did to solve this problem go	Um so I didnt really know what to do	sd	3
Um so I didnt really know what to do	So I did 50 times 8	sd	4
I cant hear you	I didnt really know what to do so I did like 50 times 8	sd	4
Okay what did you get	I got 40	sd	4
Okay	And then I put the decimal point behind the four and then I did eight times two which is 16	sd	5
And then I put the decimal point behind the four and then I did eight times two which is 16	So then I put the 16 behind the four	sd	5
So then I put the 16 behind the four	And I got four and 16100	sd	5
Am I correct	Yeah I put it behind the four	sd	4
Why did you know to put the decimal after the four Julia	Because it was a multiplying by like a 10th	sd	5
How did you write that 16	It looks like this	sd	4
Blake do you agree or disagree with her	Agree	sd	2
Okay if you all agree give me a thumbs up	I agree	aa	2
I agree	But I did it a totally different way	sd	2
So Kate explain to me what you did	So I wrote it out like this	sd	5
So I wrote it out like this	And I did two times eight is six	sd	5
And I did two times eight is six	And then um	sd	1
Eight times two is really six	Sorry two times eight is 16	sd	4
Sorry two times eight is 16	And so I put down the six and then I carried the one	sd	5
And so I put down the six and then I carried the one	And then I did five times eight is 40 and then plus the one and did 41	sd	5
And then I did five times eight is 40 and then plus the one and did 41	And then I went down and I added the decimal point and came down like from the place values and went to	sd	5
So what type of multiplication did you use here Kate	US traditional	sd	4
US traditional and what are we supposed to master by the end of the year	US traditional	sd	4
Does that make better sense to you now Julia	Yes	b	1
Explain why it makes better sense now	It makes sense because I did eight times the 10 first when I was supposed to do eight times the one first	sd	5
Duncan turn your mic on for me	Yes	b	1
How am I going to write this as a whole number	Im your youre gonna wait what do you mean by write as a whole number	sd	3
So how am I going to solve 928 divided by 1000	Um youre gonna um so 928 divided by 1000	sd	1
Um youre gonna um so 928 divided by 1000	Um so thered be a decimal point at the end of 928	sd	5
Um so thered be a decimal point at the end of 928	And then you would move that um three times cause of the three zeros	sd	5
And then you would move that um three times cause of the three zeros	And then it would be 09 28	sd	5
Go	Um so it was the 1000	sd	5
Um so it was the 1000	Um the three zeros	sd	5
Um the three zeros	Um you would move that three times and then the decimal you would move the decimal three times	sd	5
Um you would move that three times and then the decimal you would move the decimal three times	And then	sd	1
Is my answer right or wrong Landon	Its wrong	sd	4
Make sure theyre talking about place value of the number and how it becomes a whole versus the 10ths hundredths 1000ths Okay	Are we switching off sage and scribe	sd	1
I am going to put you into groups of	And then you want us to do the page called San Fran decimals	sd	1
Okay	Miss Strathom	sd	1
That is your job today	Do we like should we do ones that we already did with our partner	sd	1
Did you solve it	No	b	1
You didnt have to solve it	You dont need to solve it because its a yes or no question and	sd	5
Abigail	So you didnt have to solve it because it its minus 50 and thats not plus 50	sd	5
So you didnt have to solve it because it its minus 50 and thats not plus 50	It wouldnt be greater than 45 times nine	sd	5
How do you know Ethan	Because 25 times nine up there then theres 25 times nine up there plus eight which is added to it	sd	5
Fletcher	Its times two	sd	4
How do you know	Because its going to turn out zero because the numbers are the same	sd	5
Because its going to turn out zero because the numbers are the same	I dont exactly know the exact number but I know its going to be the same exact number so when you subtract both then its going to be zero	sd	5
Chris	The answer is going to be in two groups because dividing by two youve got to split the answer into two groups	sd	5
Because if youre dividing by two the answers going to be	Half of it	sd	4
How do you know Julian	Because once you do the	sd	5
Because once you do the	But you divide by half and then you just get it exactly halfway	sd	5
So you would divide it by two	Yes	b	1
All right Austin how do you know	I know because if youre multiplying by two its going to be two times as large	sd	5
What would the coordinates be of that point	Five four	sd	4
Does everybody know what a rule is	Yeah	b	1
This is her rule	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So how do you double it	qy	3
So how do you double it	That way	aa	4
That way	Or	b	1
When its the first coordinate which axis	That one	sd	4
So if she doubles that side	Which is that one right	aa	4
How would you describe that compared to the first one	Longer	sd	4
So I would call that wider	Yeah	b	1
And you could say how much its going to be wider by too	Do we do both of these	sd	1
What	Do we do both of these	sd	1
How did that change it	Made it wider longer	sd	4
So if you just double the first coordinate what do you think is going to happen to the sailboat	Will it be	ba	1
Then what is it going to do to it	Good job	sd	1
So go ahead and put it on there	Its there	sd	1
Where are your math tools	Do I do 18	sd	1
Use your straight edge and connect them	Since weve all gone through both pages do we do the red boxes	sd	1
Im going to give you about three more minutes to finish it up	Hi I have one last problem	sd	1
Okay good job	All right so I thought it would be wider	sd	4
All right so I thought it would be wider	Got to do the next page	sd	1
Im sorry what	Got to do that last problem	sd	1
Thank you	So I think itll be wider because	sd	4
Do you want a different one	Im good	sd	1
Okay gotcha	This is the right triangle right	sd	4
No	Oh its not	sd	1
So a right triangle has to have two edges	Yeah	b	1
So this is the triangle right	Yeah	b	1
So they have bisected that triangle to make a right triangle do you see that	Oh	b	1
So in order for this to be a right triangle one of these angles would have to be right	Oh okay	b	1
So do you have a question for me or are you good	Im good	sd	1
Are you done	Yeah	b	1
Oh you did	Yeah	b	1
Did you agree	Yeah	b	2
Were you specific	Yep	b	1
So here I could put how much wider thats not specific	Five you said its going to be wider than five because theyre doubling it	sd	5
Five you said its going to be wider than five because theyre doubling it	Well yeah it would be 10 because what you divided five by is	sd	5
But when youre multiplying by two what do you say	Because you dont double the second numbers	sd	5
So zero times two	Zero times two is	sd	1
You have to multiply the first one by two	Oh	b	1
Josh	Its what you would do like I remember doing the rule books in like second grade its telling you what to do like times two or times four	sd	4
So something you do to a number maybe	Yeah	b	1
Are we clear about that	Yeah	b	1
What was your guess	I thought it was going to be longer and wider	sd	4
Why did you think that	Well I thought because if you double the coordinates then I thought maybe it could be longer	sd	5
So you said longer	Yeah	b	1
So the new trapezoid was going to be wider but wider Fletcher what did you say	Well I said its going to be wider because you multiply	sd	5
Okay yes	Its two times the first the horizontal	sd	4
X coordinate	Two times	sd	4
By two	By two	sd	1
By two	And that makes them go farther and longer	sd	5
Abigail	So the new trapezoid is still going to be as tall as it was because thats what	sd	4
Same height	Yes	b	1
Yes	And its still going to be on the Y axis for four and then its going to be longer on the X	sd	4
So wider	X axis	sd	4
Julian	By two	sd	4
How would you say that	Because it says you double the first one but it would be longer because the first number is always going to be longer and youre doubling that so it would make it longer	sd	5
Julian said it	By two	sd	4
Wider by two wider How is it wider	Double the width	sd	4
Whats another way to say it	Wider by two times	sd	4
Josh	I was going to say it could also be wider by five squares because thats what	sd	5
I was going to say it could also be wider by five squares because thats what	It never got farther than five because when you got here if you didnt draw anything it only got to the five area and thats how far it got	sd	5
It never got farther than five because when you got here if you didnt draw anything it only got to the five area and thats how far it got	So then it could be farther by five because its five times	sd	5
Landon	I thought of the rule that goes horizontal vertical and then I estimated that it would be longer because you double the X axis which always comes first	sd	5
I thought of the rule that goes horizontal vertical and then I estimated that it would be longer because you double the X axis which always comes first	So youd go farther across and still go the same height	sd	5
If we double the first coordinate here its going to be what Ariana	Two and four	sd	4
Savannah	10 and four	sd	4
And then if I double the first coordinate here whats it going to be Ally	10 zero	sd	4
And whats the E coordinate	Zero and zero	sd	4
Talk to your shoulder partner	By double	sd	4
Double if I multiplied it by three	Oh by three	sd	1
Elijah	We thought it would be way longer because it	sd	4
What does long mean	Wider	sd	4
It would be way wider if we changed the second coordinate	Oh the second	sd	1
Ari	It would get taller	sd	4
It would get taller	Yeah	b	1
How much taller	Three times taller	sd	4
Fletcher	Youd multiply the Y axis times two	sd	4
So you followed the rule and what did you create	A new trapezoid	sd	4
Abigail	Because the instructions told you that you need to multiply it by two	sv	5
Abigail	You had to multiply the first coordinates by two	sd	4
Yes	And then	sd	1
Did you write it down	Yeah	b	1
So this is your new problem	Thank you	aa	1
You guys all should have your CER	Thank you	aa	1
Whats up	Can I just	sd	1
Oh Ethan	When it says to make it larger does it mean it as making it taller and wider or both	sd	3
How many years has he been there	More than 10	sd	4
What do we need	How many days are in a year	sd	4
How many days in a year		b	4
		b	2
So now what do we do	Maybe we times it by something because its 9855 days	sd	5
What do you want to multiply it with	The 365	sd	4
Why did you do that	Because	sd	1
So Penelope says she tried this	If you use multiplication	aa	4
Do you think multiplication would solve this problem	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	Division	b	2
Im hearing some yes  Im hearing some no	I did something similar	sd	2
Do you think this will solve our problem	No but I figured out how	sd	1
Is that what we want to figure it out	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
So lets think about it some more	Division	b	4
You did what	I did 9356	sd	4
Carrie what do you think	I think we should divide	sd	4
Why would we divide	Divide a year	sd	4
Julia what do you think	I agree with her because it would make more sense  in the process because this one wouldnt make that much sense because like you said it says days in 9855 years and this one would make more sense because its actually going to tell you the years because as we remember yesterday when we were dividing that one that one made more sense because it actually had a smaller number than what it has  now	sd	5
I agree with her because it would make more sense  in the process because this one wouldnt make that much sense because like you said it says days in 9855 years and this one would make more sense because its actually going to tell you the years because as we remember yesterday when we were dividing that one that one made more sense because it actually had a smaller number than what it has  now	So it wouldnt make sense with multiplication	sd	5
How old do you think Ivan is	From the voice from the movie he sounds pretty young	sd	4
Over a hundred years	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	Okay	b	1
So if your answer was over  100 does it make sense	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
Does that work	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
We know that gorillas probably dont live to be hundreds of years old or even thousands	They probably live to be around the humans age	sd	1
But lets think about what dividing would be	but I did know what to divide by	sd	1
So in order to make a year how many days will  Ivan have had to have been in the enclosure	Probably like	sd	1
This is definitely way above where were at	We dont even know how to get 365	sd	3
So we know lets think about this we know 365 times one is		b	4
		b	2
Does that help me out	Yes	b	1
10 years	Thats a lot and thats not even our answer yet	sd	4
Could I do that again	Yeah	b	1
Another 10 years	I got 25	sd	4
I got 25	I got 87	sd	2
I got 87	15 years	b	2
15 years	Zero years	aa	2
Okay now can I do another 3650	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	I know exactly what to do	sd	1
What	We have to do some wrestling with 365 times seven	sd	4
That sounds like extra work for me	I did 365 times eight	sd	4
So what is 365 times seven James	Well to make it easier for myself I did 365 times six and then 365 time one	sd	5
Whats 365 times three	1  095	b	4
1  095	Me too	sd	2
Me too	I got that one too	sd	2
I got that one too	26 years	aa	2
26 years	I got 25	sd	2
The thing here	Kind of	sd	1
Kind of	I did	sd	1
Did you get 1410	Nope	sd	1
What did  you get there	Isnt it  26 years	sd	4
Okay	I didnt know that we were supposed to divide by 365 so I divided by one	sd	4
Does my answer make sense	Yes	b	1
If we answered Ivans been in the enclosure for 27 years does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Yes	If its somewhere around there it also kind of makes sense	sd	2
Probably be dead by then	So I  know  but I tried addition because I knew  and I know thats wrong but I was going to try	sd	4
So I think about so Ivan was in his cell or his domain and lets say he had a marker and he was keeping tally of every day hes been in there right	His whole domain would have been filled up	sd	4
His whole domain would have been filled up	Right	b	1
what did you get	The bottle	sd	1
Your final  answer		b	4
Nathan what was your answer	I divided and	sd	4
27		b	4
What was your answer		b	4
David		b	4
25		b	4
Julia do you have a written answer	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I got 30 with the remainder of two	sd	4
How does she know when shes got enough	Division	b	4
Why do you think division	Because its groups of the water bottles	sd	5
Now she could be in her mind doing this Okay I have four and then I added another four and another four and another four	Thats going to take forever	sd	4
What is she doing right here	Adding	sd	4
Repeated addition right	Multiplication	aa	4
Whats our easier way	Division	b	4
Piper	We can do  four times 30	sd	4
What is four times 30		b	4
		b	2
What was your mistake	My mistake was	sd	1
He wrote 20 here	I had to rewrite it because I just	sd	1
Definitely	I thought it would be easier if I did 120 but it didnt really work	sd	4
So it kind of gives you a little bit of a hint of whats happening	Okay	b	1
Okay	I did not know what you mean but from the answer do you mean the one where you do something times four equals 112	sd	4
So when you gave me that 112	I thought thats my answer	sd	4
I thought thats my answer	The number I got was 28	sd	4
I really like multiplication Im just going to multiply it	You cant be like Ooh I really like that	sd	1
Should we have to guess what youre doing today	No	b	1
Question	Can we work with partners	sd	1
Matteo whats your answer		b	4
Tell me how you got 17	I just added 9 plus 8 and got 17	sd	5
Why did you add nine plus eight	Because I saw since 8 more so I thought it was talking about adding	sd	5
Eight plus nine is		b	4
I know that nine times eight is		b	4
Do we really know what Daren read	No	b	1
Could I put those number sentences together	Yes	b	1
Now could we figure out how much Daren read	Yes	b	1
How much did he read	40 books	aa	4
Daren read 40 books	Yeah	b	1
Could we combine them again	Yes	b	1
Owen what are you thinking		b	4
So four times three is		b	4
Do you think you understand how to pull this number sentence out of a number story	Yes	b	1
I dont know if we use her chalk to draw a line  Diegos line was 36 feet long	Wait what page is it	sd	1
Wait what page is it		b	1
Do we know what the D is	Yeah	b	1
But how much is it worth		b	4
Do we know how many times the line is	No	b	1
So thats going to say do we know how Shares line is	Yes	b	1
How long		b	4
Six equals 36 James	Six times six	sd	4
Six times six	Its a square number	sd	4
What	What is 2 times 18	sd	3
So you think you can handle this	Yes	b	1
How did you How much did you and your partner both get	So I split one pizza in half	sd	4
Which one doesnt matter	No	b	1
No	And then both had oh no	sd	5
And then both had oh no	one half was given to one person and the other half was given to the other person	sd	5
one half was given to one person and the other half was given to the other person	And then you get and then somebody gets one pizza then the other guy gets that pizza	sd	5
Alright so how much did each person get in all Addy	One and a half	sd	4
Im gonna redraw my circles	Okay so me and Angie we split the pizza	sd	5
Okay so me and Angie we split the pizza	We split all 3 pizza in half	sd	5
We split all 3 pizza in half	So that means that so far we all got at least three slice and then we split it into another half	sd	5
So that means that so far we all got at least three slice and then we split it into another half	So we can at least get six slices	sd	5
So you said you split them in half Yes	Yes	b	1
And then did you split them another time	Yes	b	1
Yes	And then we split them diagnal like this	sd	5
And then we split them diagnal like this	We split them all like that	sd	5
We split them all like that	And then we did the same thing over here	sd	5
And then we did the same thing over here	So that while getting the exact same amount of slices	sd	5
how many slices to do each get	We each got eight slices	sd	4
And also how many pieces were in this one	pieces were eight	sd	4
And you said youre saying that you each got eight	Yes	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	1
How did you guys split up this one	We each got four slices	sd	4
Brenda youre noddindyour head	Its saying the same thing because we each got like one full pizza And we got a half	sd	5
Yeah so they just got one whole pizza	we just split it up differently	sd	3
Or is that leftover	leftover	sd	1
okay Geof you have a different way that we can split up these pizzas	I have 12345678 in the middle	sd	4
I have 12345678 in the middle	All were talking about the noise	sd	1
All were talking about the noise	Oh so I feel like I have a solution for just drawing 7 lines in each one but I Coopert think thatd be possible	sd	4
Okay inaudible	inauidble Straight and then that and that and then that but then make another line like in the middle	sd	4
Why does each person get three pieces	Everybody gets three pieces Because there is two sides	sd	5
Everybody gets three pieces Because there is two sides	Theres two sides	sd	5
Theres two sides	So one side for the other person one set for the other	sd	5
In this case what the denominator be	your denominator would be a two	sd	4
And so then Im Lucci how many are they each getting in all	three	sd	4
Im seeing a lot of heads nodding Im seeing a couple questioning eyes nodding	It just kicked me out the meeting so I had to rejoin	sd	1
How could I split these pizzas up for six people	How many pizzas are there	sd	3
See them on my board	yes now I do	sd	1
yes now I do	Can you pre split them into fourths for me	sd	4
Absolutely I can	T Can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Go quickly Cooper	All right	aa	1
All right	Um Can you please color one piece from each pizza green	sd	4
It is going to be person one	Yes	b	1
Alright and Asher I want to ask you a question right now	Ok	b	1
Okay Asher is there enough pieces left for each of my other five people to get an equal amount is the first person	Im getting there	sd	1
So what color do you want the person two	person two is red	sd	4
Okay great	person four is purple	sd	4
How about person 3	Person 3 is purple  sorry	sd	4
Its okay	Person four is black	sd	4
Person four is black	Person five is blue	sd	4
Youre testing how many markers I have	and what other colors do you have	sd	1
and what other colors do you have	inaudible	sd	1
All right	Now Can you please split them into thirds	sd	4
So if I split what I have left If I split these even like this am I going to be able to give equal parts to the rest of the people	No	aa	1
inauidble person gets equal	I have the answer	sd	1
inauidble  what was your idea	So to the way to make your pizzas  like cut into inaudible ways like cutting it 2 ways  its like  to do like that or like that	sd	4
Oh how many pieces should I cut each pizza into	Oh a inauidble cut like that much and much	sd	4
So are you saying 4 in each	So youre trying to get two so just like that	sd	4
Is that gonna split evenly among my people	No	b	1
Okay so Pedro Tani Hager how many pieces would you splitWell what Idea do you have	eight	sd	4
eight pieces Why	Because Okay	sd	1
Because Okay	So like split split all of them into like like one half or something like that	sd	4
One half	like draw a line a line between all of them	sd	4
like draw a line a line between all of them	And then now the very last one	sd	4
And then now the very last one	Do another line	sd	4
So then how much of this pizza is each person getting	one piece of pizza each for each person	sd	4
And what was the fraction for this one piece	16th	b	4
We started with our six again	Its the same exact answer for for this This answer is the answer to the first question	sd	4
How many pieces in all would each person get	four	sd	4
four	four pieces of pizza	sd	4
four pieces of pizza	six pieces of pizza	sd	4
Zoey whats not clicking	I cant figure out like like so like you drew like five lines that made like six six pieces	sd	3
I cant figure out like like so like you drew like five lines that made like six six pieces	But like Im not really sure how you made six six pieces of pizza	sd	3
So the actual like the actual act of drawing it	Yes	b	1
Are all of those pieces equal	No	b	1
Now were all of these fairly equal	Yes	b	1
How many pieces did each person get	16th I mean 14 out of six  four and six	sd	4
Dont touch it	I wont touch it	sd	1
Does that sound good everyone	worksheet	aa	1
What do you cSS an elephant that doesnt matter	I dont know Mr G what	sd	1
Is that a straight line	It looks like my straight lines	sd	1
Time what does it go up by every time	1	b	4
What does it go up by here	2	b	4
2	2	b	2
2	And then	sd	3
And then	If SS those were 2 would it be linear	sd	5
Lewis	The way that I think about it is that if you find that it goes up by a steady number on each side then its linear	sv	5
there and then the last one will be up there	Do the perfect line do it do it	sd	1
Do the perfect line do it do it	Thats good enough	ba	1
Is it a straight line is it	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Its not perfect but its	But its good	sd	1
Over here what does it go up by every time	2	b	4
2 2 2 2 these go up by	One point five times every second	sd	4
How many meters per one second	15	b	4
One second is 15 meters	I was saying it was 15 times the time he walked	sd	4
Distance 15 x time	Can you turn X 23 equals to	sv	4
Luiss walking rate does that equation look pretty similar to the one I just wrote	Yes	b	1
Luiss walking rate is going to be linear what is Luiss walking rate	225 meters per second	sd	4
Everybody good with that so far	Yes	b	1
Lyles walking rate does that equation look like one that weve been working on in here	Not reSSy	sd	1
I want to draw on this table so we can see what were actuSSy talking about here and what this equation means	Wait what does the R stands for	sd	3
R represents walking rate	Okay	b	1
Okay	Why isnt it W	sd	3
Why isnt it W	Is that the ratio table	sd	4
If Lyle is walking one meter per second how long would it take him to do this race	100 seconds	sd	4
Thats doing a very slow walk for 100meters	A snail could beat him	sd	1
Everybody agree so far	Yes	b	2
Lets say Lyle goes one meter per second faster now hes going two meters per second	Lyle is speeding up now	sd	4
How long is it going to take him to do this race	50 seconds	sd	4
What if Lyle does three meters per Second	33 13	b	4
Everybody agree 33 13 seconds	Yes	b	2
What about if he goes four meters per second	25 seconds	sd	4
Its not very slow but its also not the fastest run that you could possibly do	How long  his age	sd	1
What about 5 meters per second	20	b	4
20 seconds I would say its like if anyone in here was to run either as fast as they could I dont know it depends on how fast you are but itd probably be around 20 seconds for the 100meter dash	So goes for my grandpa to	sd	1
Thats reSSy reSSy reSSy fast	So it goes grandpa to walking to his speedwalking to kindergarten	sd	1
Is this always going down by 50	No	b	1
Does that make sense that one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Is there a faster way to  you always	sd	1
I think that its good to start seeing how they connect	For sponsor B instead of writing 5 donation I just wrote 5 no matter what	sd	4
5 regardless starts at 5 and then is sponsor B getting anything every kilometer	No	b	1
Sponsor B should be zero dollars per kilometer so its not gaining anything Malcom	Will the sponsors  without money	sd	1
These three blue dots are where it crosses the Yaxis and what it means is thats their donation or how much money they get no matter what Gloria	Could you technicSSy respond to Sponsor B	sd	5
Could you technicSSy respond to Sponsor B	It could be you get 5 if youre looking at every 10 kilometers you get one cent because  dont see it	sv	5
The second number C which means cost so zero caps for 5 is that this ratio	No	b	1
Is three hats for 15 the ratio	Yes	b	1
Because it asks for two points	I know	aa	1
I know	Couldnt you just have chosen any random point	sd	4
Yes I just picked the first two	Oh okay	b	1
Yes I did zero and one for each one but you could pick any two	So we got them correct even if theyre not the same	sd	4
That one zone is for flexibility	Okay	b	1

Did you use something different	No	b	1
You drew a number line like that	Well I sort of thought the same thing but I actually did all	sd	2
Where did you do to figure out how far Ally ran	I did it up by doing three  by adding the top numbers because you cant add the bottom number with 10 so	sd	5
Any questions on that	Not a question but I guess  if you added the numerators if you wanted 216 would that be	sd	4
Okay and the bottom ones are pretty simple right	Yes	b	1
So Anna come on up and walk us through how youre going to start solving this problem	Im going to start	sd	1
Got to talk nice and loud	Im going to start by	sd	1
Why didnt she just add them	She multiplied because if you add them it wont be the same number	sd	5
Jamie can you explain to us why that doesnt work	That doesnt work because you need to do each number twice	sd	5
That doesnt work because you need to do each number twice	Each	b	1
Youre absolutely right but explain in a little more detail	Uhmm	sd	1
We do our horns	Yes	b	1
So Jamie walk us through what you mean and have explain it to Anna so she can show everybody what youre talking about	Okay	b	1
Okay	So you need to multiply the 200	sd	4
So start at the 200 and do what	And multiply it by 40	sd	4
How do we show that visually	We write 200	sd	4
You can show it with what	We make our arrows going from 200 to 40	sd	4
Youre absolutely right but why	Because we multiply the largest numbers first	sd	5
But can we think of a better way to say the largest numbers	Multiply the largest place value	sd	4
So then what do we do	Then we do our next largest on the left and multiply it by the largest on the right	sd	4
So Ms Elaina what are you going to do now	Now were going to write the multiple	sd	4
Will those be multiples	No	b	1

Thats what I just heard	60 times 40	sd	4
Then what	Im going to take the six again 60 again and then multiply it by five	sd	4
Okay what are you going to do now Jimmy	Im going to take the five from the 265 and add it times 40	sd	4
And multiply it times 40	Yeah	b	1
And then what	Then Im going to do five times five	sd	4
Mr Jimmy now what are you going to do	Im going to multiply all of them together but starting with the first one	sd	4
200 times five times 60 times 40 times 60 times five times five times 40 times five times five	Im only going to multiply 200 times 40	sd	4
Im only going to multiply 200 times 40	And then Im going to move down to the next one	sd	4
Jairo switch	So now	sd	1
So now	Im going to multiply 60 times 40	sd	5
Im going to multiply 60 times 40	Four times six is 24	sd	5
Four times six is 24	And then I add in the two zeros	sd	5
And then I add in the two zeros	And I get 2400	sd	5
And I get 2400	And then six times 60 times five equals Six times five equals	sd	5
Just take your finger like this Just tap it	And then that equals 30 and then I add in the one zero	sd	4
Tell us	Im going to do 60 times five	sd	4
That was already done	Five times 60	sd	4
Thats actually a four	Okay	b	1
Make it look like a four for me please	This one	sd	1
What do you get when you multiply five times four		b	4
Whats my problem then if you got it right	Than your place value	sd	4
All right Mr Jean what now	Now we do five times five	sd	4
All right Mr Jalen what are you going to do	Im going to add all the	sd	4
Im going to add all the	Im going to add the	sd	4

We did the first section the first paragraph under task to yourself right now please	Excuse me which way does it go	sd	1
Excuse me which way does it go	This way or that way	sd	1
Maria	Greetings from the Kalahari desert in Southern Africa	sd	1
Greetings from the Kalahari desert in Southern Africa	In this interview you will learn a lot about the Kalahari world by the records meercats	sd	1
Do you see the ordered pairs in the speech bubble there	Yes	b	1
Guys I know its a little bit tricky because you have to look the points are on the front the graph is on the back	Why dont we try with a partner and then we can learn from that	sd	1
Jonathan	How old did they live	sd	1
Nora what do you notice about the coordinate grid	From the bottom it goes to 15 and from up it goes one single	sd	4
What does it say right here	The time in months	sd	1
This is when theyre two months old four months old six months old eight months old and on the yaxis whats on the yaxis Joel	The height in inches	sd	4
Any questions about that	How do I make a picture	sd	1
My guess is were not currently in five minutes put it to good use	shorter	sd	1
Im sure five is probably more than you needed	Its all right	sd	1
I want to give you ten minutes to find the points	I think were just	sd	1
I think were just	Yes were just	sd	1
I think well be good	Yes	b	1
I did not tell you	You go first	sd	1
No were not answering yet	Im with Joel	sd	1
Im with Joel	Im with Rob	sd	1
I usually dont ask the question and then just you both immediately start talking	can be harder we can make them three	sd	1
Please thank your partner and your new one	Thank you	aa	1
At what age do meerkats reach their full height how do you know from this graph	Partner B share your thoughts	sd	1
All right I need everyone to head back to your seats	Please thank your partner as you head back to your seats	sv	1
Please thank your partner as you head back to your seats	Thank you sir	aa	1
Thank you sir	Come again	sd	1
Matt	Okay so it means its like when they havent reached one month yet theyre like a couple of days old or theyre like two weeks old	sd	4
When they are first born they are how tall	Three inches	sd	4
Michael what do you think about what Matt said	I agree with him	sd	2
I agree with him	Because my chart says the same thing and technically at zero months its not that specific	sd	2
Because my chart says the same thing and technically at zero months its not that specific	Two days to two weeks	sd	4
Allie	Hi	b	1
Hi	Okay so  I think its 12 inches because first of all in this video it says they get to 12 inches and then second of all they look 12 inches because they look like the size of a ruler	sd	5
Is there any information from your graph that can help you think that	Yes because at the very end it shows 12 inches so when theyre 20 months they are 12 inches	sd	5
Okay Sean what do you think about what Allie said	I agree with her that it said that they grow up to 12 inches because like what Allie said it even says it in the video and on the graph it only goes up to 12 inches and then it goes in a straight line	sd	2
Joel whats your thought	I disagree with them	sd	2
I disagree with them	I think when they get older they might go to 15 inches	sd	4
Do you have any data to back that up	No	b	1
What data do we have what does it show us	None	aa	1
We could make a prediction but if we wanted to know if it got bigger what would we have to do	Stick on line	sd	4
Charlie	I know when the meerkat reaches full height because at month 14 it gets to 12 inches but all the months after that it just goes in a straight line at 12 inches	sd	5
Okay so Charlie is saying that it goes up until they get to	14 months	sd	4
Kevin what do you think about what Charlie said	What	ba	1
What do you think about what Charlie said	I didnt hear what he said	sd	1
What should you ask him	Could you please repeat what you said	sv	1
Could you please repeat what you said	What I said is that the meerkat gets to their full height at month 14 because after month 14 when they hit 12 inches it just goes in a straight line from there	sd	5
What I said is that the meerkat gets to their full height at month 14 because after month 14 when they hit 12 inches it just goes in a straight line from there	I agree	aa	2
I agree	My graph says at month 14 they grow upto 12 inches and then it goes in a straight line and definitely grow older	sd	5
Do you see how we are taking realworld data about meerkats	Yes	b	1
Once we graph the ordered pairs were we able to answer questions about the data	Yes	b	1
Any thoughts any questions	No maam	sd	1
Any questions on the graphic organizer	Um yeah do we have like like are all the equations and everything that we need already in our notes	sd	1
Yes they should be	Like all the definitions	sd	1
So Jeremiah can you tell me what would be your first step to solve this equation	plus seven from the 6x	sd	4
And Andrea what would be your next step here	Sorry one second	sd	1
thats all right	You would like combine the like terms with the 6x and 5x	sd	4
All right Chris what do you think we need to do next to complete this problem	For that like Are you trying to	sd	1
So what do I need to do to find those distances	You you take those equations and you multiply eight times the amount of xs there are	sd	4
Okay thanks Chris	Yeah	b	1
Okay so any without doing any adding or subtracting or multiplying can you tell me what is qR	Would it be	ba	1
What do we know about these two segments	Theyre equal So its 41	sd	5
Okay and Fernando can you tell me what would PR be then if we know each parts 41	82	b	4
U is the midpoint of TV	Mister G could you explain that again like how you got the segment from the equation	sd	3
How would we solve a problem that looks like this	Maybe add the 12	sd	4
We want to set it equal to zero Right	Right	b	1
So could we also take away 8x at the same time	Right	b	1
And Ethan can you give me some factors of 12	Can you do 12 and one	sd	4
Ethan	Im not sure	sd	3
Can you think of another two factors of 12	2 and 6	sd	4
What do you think	Im not sure	sd	3
Im going to highlight a couple things for you Diane and then you can tell me what would you do with these two parts that Im highlighting	Oh add them	sd	4
Okay now Patrick what do you think Um what do you think we need to do next if we want to set it equal to zero	Um not sure	sd	3
Oh how would we get rid of this part	Oh minus 24	ba	4
Other Patrick Patrick Garcia Lopez what are some factors of negative 28	14 and 2	sd	4
And can we combine those two make three	No	aa	1
Okay so whats another factor pair for negative 28	I dont know	sd	3
Four times whats gonna get us 28	Four times five	sd	4
Sorry	I have a question	sd	1
Yeah go ahead Sienna	Every time that theres two answers is do they always both work	sd	3
Every time that theres two answers is do they always both work	Or do you have to check both of them	qy	3
Okay any questions so far About how I checked my work there	Um I have a question	sd	1
Whats up	If we plug in negative seven What would that thats not	sd	3
Tristan	BC hold on I gotta go back to the example	sd	1
BC hold on I gotta go back to the example	BC is Im sorry I was I finished the example A while back and I was going ahead what did I miss	sd	3
So my question was a little bit tricky I think because of the way I said it but if AB is already built then what is this gonna be a positive and negative number over here	Negative 18	sd	4
x equals negative seven is not an answer	Yeah that makes sense	sd	1
Were you able to do all five River	Yes	b	1
This is across	Some of these are hard	sd	1
All of those are over one up two or something like that for each one	How could you see that	sd	3
Anybody in here have the isosceles triangle one	point	sd	1
Which point	Its the two on the farleft side	sd	4
This one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then the one across	sd	4
This one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then go over a lot	sd	4
And then go over a lot	And go around this way	sd	4
Trapezoid anybody see the trapezoid in here	I think so	sv	1
What do you think Emily	The very top one	sd	4
The very top one	Its actually just an Lshape with more of a side right	sd	4
Or one of the opposite sides one set of opposite sides are parallel	I can make it happen	sd	1
I can make it happen	So there to the far left dot	sd	4
I dont think its that one	Okay	b	1
Are there any other dots that are vertical	Yes	b	1
Which ones	The farright ones	sd	4
The far right so these two lines are parallel right	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense	These are so hard	sd	1
Ruben what do you think	Top right	b	4
Top right	Move onto the left two on the right and then draw it up	sd	4
Emily	The second dot down on the left	sd	4
The second dot down on the left	And then the farright dot	sd	4
And then the farright dot	And then the dot inbetween the right and the left	sd	4
Its a challenge to explain which dots on pictures like this right	Yeah	b	1
This one took me a while to see earlier	Top middle	sd	4
Its a diagonal square right	Right	b	1
Have these tortured anybody	Yes	b	1
Shane	Its the point between those two dots and it splits it evenly	sd	4
Anybody in here neShane more time to write down these two parts	I do	sd	1
If youre done writing down these parts you can go ahead and graph the four points for example one making a parallelogram	Im good now	sd	1
Emily	The opposite sides are parallel	sd	4
Good luck Finley	Thank you	aa	1
I think so	You could Y2 trade the exponent for the Y2 on this	sd	4
You dont really have to for midpoint but you can because it doesnt matter what order you add them up in	It doesnt	sd	1
Emily	Can you also just add them and divide by two	sd	4
Just sometimes its way faster like for zero and two if you think of it as a zero its like why not do that right	Right	b	1
Whats the exact middle of zero and one	One half	sd	4
So whats one of the main things we know about a rhombus	All sides are congruent	sd	4
What do you notice about the Y values	Theres only going to be two	sd	4
Just write zero	How did you write it	sd	3
Positive six	Shouldnt that be minus	sd	4
Its flat	Isnt it undefinShane	sd	4
When you have two perpendicular lines whats the product of their slopes	Negative one	sd	4
Whats right in the middle	Zero	sd	4
Does that sound good everybody	Yes	b	1
Emily	They are parallel lines	sd	4
Good morning class	Good morning Mister	sd	1
Have you heard the word	Yes I have	sd	1
Yes I have	Ive heard  close to	sd	1

Do you know what it means	It goes with	sd	1
Have you heard it before	Yes	b	1
Have you heard this word before	No	b	1
The theme I heard was weve heard this word but we dont remember exactly what it means	I know what it means	sd	1
If we call this angle one and angle two you would say that angle one and angle two are what	Adjacent	sd	4

Do you want this	Do you want this	qy	1
Just put on this table right here	Is this the worksheet	sd	1
Looks like Mark according to you guys is not showing up anymore right	I know	aa	1
How many people actually did their box and whisker plot yesterday or last night for homework	No	b	1
No	It was homework	sd	1
I thought most of you got it done in class	Tomorrow	b	1
Great question	Its more timeconsuming	sd	1
Are you hitting that with your head	Yes	b	1
If they dont it might be that I made a mistake it might be that you made a mistake but its probably you	I know  I dont know whare I went wrong	sd	3
Kumar say it again	Can I just read both of them or just one of them	sd	1
Just read one of them	All right	aa	1
All right	I said last years class has a bigger outlier than this years	sd	4
You said last years class has a bigger outlier than this years	Yes	b	1
Where did you see that	The 192 and 142 is higher apart from the 159 167 or something	sd	4
This was Zoe right	Yes it was probably	sd	1
Do you think Zoe was an outlier	Yes	b	1
Is he far enough away from the data to be considered weird	No	b	1
Were not calling Zoe weird	Yes we are	sd	1
Dont tell anyone	Watch him walk in and be like Hey man youre weird	sd	1
One of the things were going to learn next week is how weird do you have to be to be considered an outlier	Very weird	sd	4
For right now do you think Zoe maybe is an outlier	No	b	1
This was Jeanie right	Yes	b	1
Do you think Jeanie was an outlier	Wait I know her	sd	1
Who was this	It was Cooper	sd	4
Youre the tallest person in here do you think youre an outlier	No	b	1
Is Cooper weird enough compared to the rest of the data to be considered an outlier	No	b	1
Is his whisker thats way out here far enough away from the rest of the stuff	No	b	1
Who is this	Kate	aa	4
You guys say one of yours	We said that the data was more condensed this year than last year	sd	4
Does anybody agree or disagree with that	Agree	sd	2
Do that with your hands again	Yes	b	1
If you look at how far spread out the data is is last years data way more spread out	Yes	b	1
If we lined last years class up from the smallest kid to the biggest kid will there be more of a difference between the shortest and the tallestSthan this year	Yes	b	1
Okay	Last years minimum height was smaller than this years minimum height	sd	4
Should we go find Jeanie and remeasure her	Yes	b	1
Maybe she got shorter	Yes it could happen I guess	sd	1
Ellis whatd you say	I said they hit their growth spurt earlier	sd	4
Okay why do you think they hit their growth spurt earlier	Because of Puberty	sd	4
Do you want to come up here and show me what youre talking about	Sorry	aa	1
Ill stand over here because Im not sure where youre pointing at	Honestly I dont know what Im also pointing at	sd	3
Which class do you think on average was taller than the other class	Ours	sd	4
I heard both	Ours	sd	4
Why do you think this years class is taller	Theirs seems	sd	1
I like that	Just look at the median and figure out the difference between	sd	4
Our middle person was 171 right	Yes	b	1
Whose middle person was taller	Ours	sd	4
While I pass out your note catcher I want you guys to turn and talk what does that make you think of	History Instagram	sd	4
Somebody tell me what does the word histogram make you think of	Like a graph	sd	4
Like a graph	History and graph put together	sd	2
History and graphing put together	Or history not like I don t know	sd	1
Is a histogram have anything to do with history	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Whats another word that it makes you think of	Bar graph	sd	4
Bar graph okay	It is an art	sd	1
It is an art	Yes art	sd	1
Ways in which theyre the same and ways in which theyre not	Im writing them down now	sd	1
No use your head and your notes	Thats good advice	ba	1
I wont take that away from you	Everything here is provided which is interesting	sd	4
Ill share with you guys the data that I get from it	You will	sd	1
Tell me a way in which these are the same as that	I don t know how to do that	sd	3
You don t have what	I don t know how to start explaining	sd	3
What are you saying	Im looking and this one has numbers in a number and then this one its just Oh wait a minute	sd	4
No rectangles right	That ones obvious	sd	1
That ones obvious	I know	aa	1
When you make a histogram do you make bars to make the histogram	No	b	1
Is it a true statement to say that theyre the same because they both have bars	No ones shaded different the other one is not	sd	4
What do you mean by that	Theyre actually separated	sd	4
Theyre actually separated	The histograms are all together	sd	4
Theyre touching each other like that	Yes	b	1
Theyre separated where	On the bar graph	sd	4
Whats another same	Histograms	sd	4
Thats another same	They both have formed a bar graph	sd	4
Theyre both made out of bars	They have an x and yaxis	sd	4
Yes	They have numbers	sd	4
Where do you see that they both have numbers	Y	b	4
Okay so lets say that they both have numbers on the yaxis	It looks like you probably have to use height to show data	sd	4
Oh height of the bar	Yes  obvious	sd	1
You guys need to be quiet when were trying to have a class discussion with me and somebody else so you can hear what they say	The histograms are not accepted	sd	4
What do you mean	They are not exactly with all the numbers	sd	4
The histogram doesnt use all of the numbers	They use it but Theres not accepted	sd	4
Lets see if that comes out in some of the other things were talking about	All the bar graph starts at 0 for the x and y	sd	4
All the bar graph starts at 0 for the x and y	They both	sd	1
This one starts at 0	I cant see that	sd	1
Whats on your page	Oh I can see it	sd	1
Whats another way that theyre different	The one on the right seems like mean and mode and whatnot	sd	4
Oh so for histogram were going to get mean mode and those kind of things	Yes	b	1
Guys theres one essential difference that Im not hearing yet	I don t know how to word it	sd	1
What do you mean by that	The one saying basketball gymnastics soccer tennis and then the other one s numbers	sd	4
If I said right now I went around and did this and I said  Celeste whats your favorite color	Black	sd	1
A big list of what	Data	aa	4
What kind of data is it going to be	A bar graph	sd	4
If I ask you whats your favorite color I heard black I heard pink I heard yellow I heard black	Blue	sd	1
You want a blue up here just so blue doesnt feel left out	Yes	b	1
Were going to get	Someone s 13 here	sd	1
Someone s 13 here	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thats crazy	ba	1
Thats crazy	Me	b	1
Me	Youre 13	sd	1
Youre 13	Years old	sd	1
Years old	Yes	b	1
What are these things	Numbers	aa	4
Which one of these would I make a bar graph out of	Words	aa	4
Words	Words	aa	2
What would I make for this one	A histogram	sd	4
If you go out and you ask people a question that they respond to you with a number youre going to use a histogram	Oh my gosh	ba	1
Oh my gosh	I just	sd	1
Go to the next page and lets fill out the steps for how you make one at the top of page 2	Why you made the boxes big this time	sd	3
If youre not neat when you make it it totally destroys the purpose of making a display because you need to have neat numbers	Thats 73 exactly	aa	1
I went around to the commons this morning and I just asked people how much money was in their pocket	No you didn t	qy	1

Where does this kid go	Ten to twenty	sd	4
Where does that kid go	Same thing the top	sd	4
Where does the 26 kid go	Same thing	sd	4
Where does the 50 kid go	Fifty to sixty	sd	4
Do you get different shapes depending on what you count by	Yes	b	1
What if I made it be just one big bar	You got to get estimate	sd	4
Is that a very interesting histogram	Yes	b	1
Could you go like this and count off by ones	You could	sd	4
You could	It will take forever	sd	4
I went to PetSmart last night and I looked at the fish tanks and I counted how many fish were in each of the fish tanks	Did you really	aa	1

I dont know I just thought of two three letter words and cat and dog	I accidentally before he told us we were starting the test	sd	1
I accidentally before he told us we were starting the test	away I accidentally already started it	sd	1
away I accidentally already started it	So like its running up my time right now	sd	1
So like its running up my time right now	But I have like three questions left	sd	1
For Which one	The practice test chapter four	sd	1
There Is there a time on that time limit	Yes says 49 minutes remaining	sd	1
Yes says 49 minutes remaining	There was like an hour	sd	1
So Im just gonna take off the time limit	Okay thank you	sd	1
I just forgot to take it off	Sorry I started it without further instruction	sd	1
Can anybody tell me what the slope is	The slope is negative two	sd	4
And once you get practice writing in equations from these sorts of problems	My computers lagging right now and wont let me write	sd	1
Okay Mallory can you tell me since were looking at yours whats the y intercept for this problem	zero and 43	sd	4
Thanks Stella for sharing that one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I think so	sv	1
how did you get those different fonts Then	Its hard to type it So Im just going to say it	sd	1
Its hard to type it So Im just going to say it	I highlighted it and then right clicked on it	sd	1
I highlighted it and then right clicked on it	And then it says emojis and symbols	sd	1
Oh like if you just type something in the chat and then highlight it	Yeah and then highlight it or like highlight one letter then emojis and symbols	sd	1
Yeah and then highlight it or like highlight one letter then emojis and symbols	Its also a way to put emojis in	sd	1
Its also a way to put emojis in	then then a search bar and just put like the letter B and then picked one	sd	1
So is this a function or not	I say its not a function because the numbers in the domain box repeat	sd	5
I say its not a function because the numbers in the domain box repeat	And if we think of inauidble whats it called	sd	3
the vertical line test	yeah the vertical line test	sd	1
So let me go back to this one	It touches two points at one time	sd	4
Ringing a bell	Yes	b	1
Sounds familiar	Yes	b	1
What am I talking about	Fractions	aa	4
Fractions	Equal fractions	b	2
Martine whats a fraction	I forgot	sd	4
Ali whats a fraction	Like parts of the pieces	sd	4
Like parts of the pieces	Parts of a whole	sd	4
Jake	Denominator	b	4
What does a numerator tell you	If the bottoms and the  its equal No	sd	4
If the bottoms and the  its equal No	How many pieces we eat	sd	4
Renata	The denominator means that how many pieces we got from for example the whole pizza	sd	4
Kyle what is my fraction going to be	14	b	4
Do you agree	Yes	b	2
Yes Bud	I will say it in a different way 14	sd	4
Does that mean the same thing	Yes	b	1
Sonia what does it mean	Its a fraction that has the same amount	sd	4
Were looking at that equal part right	Yes	b	1
If we take our fraction 14 and I say give me a fraction thats equivalent to 14 can you come up with one	Yes	b	1
Write an example	12	b	4
12	Maybe 12 in one	sd	2
Be careful	No	b	1
You got one	Yes	b	1
Whatever you do to the top	You do to the bottom	sd	4
Who have I not talked Xavier	28	b	4
Xavier says 28 is the same as 14	I agree	aa	2
I agree	Yes	b	2
We agree	Yes	b	2
What do we do	First you have do 1 x 2	sd	4
Why are you doing 1 x 2	To get the numerator	sd	4
Okay keep going	At the bottom you do 4 x 2	sd	4
Because	Because whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	sd	5
1 x 2 is 2 and 4 x 2 is		b	4
If we were to go over to our picture and we were to now make eight slices of pizza did I change how much I colored in	Yes	b	1
Did I change this black part over here	No	b	1
I just made my pieces	Smaller	sd	4
Which reminds me the bigger the denominator	The smaller the pizza	sd	4
Sonia		b	4
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
Is that going to work	No	b	1
Judith	416	b	4
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
4 x 4 is		b	4
Does that work	Yes	b	1
Are you remembering this	Yes	b	1
Is that what youre telling me	No	b	1
Lets go	Why do you stop	qy	1
Why do you stop	Do you get tired with each one	sd	1
I want everybody to come up with at least one	Can you try another one	sd	1
Give me an equivalent fraction for 13	26	b	4
Whats another one	3296	b	4
What do you think she multiplied our numerator and denominator by	1 x 32	sd	2
Why do you think she multiplied by 32	To get something times Anything by one is the same number	sd	5
In order to go from one to 32 she had to multiply by		b	2
Renata	Another one that I have is 128 at the top and 384	sd	4
Kai do you have another one	No	b	1
No	I dont know anything about that	sd	1
I dont know anything about that	Even if I was Im trying to figure out what the higher number is	sd	1
EH what do you think	1664	b	4
What did you multiply by		b	4
Whats another one	515	b	4
What do we multiply by	By five	sd	4
What else	217	b	4
Im sorry what	217	b	4
Could we multiply by anything	Yes	b	1
Is there a rule	No	b	1
I have the fraction 13 I want an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 12	Got it	sd	1
Jeremy what are we going to do	I dont know	sd	1
Kai what are we going to do	Ive figured it out it takes four threes because First turns into six nine	sd	5
Ive figured it out it takes four threes because First turns into six nine	Then it turns into 12 so just make that 1 x 4 and its four	sd	5
Did you pick up on the starting	Can I please multiply 3 x 4 which is 12	sd	5
Can I please multiply 3 x 4 which is 12	Then putting the 4 x 1 which he got four because	sd	5
Because whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Miss Calice because shes so amazing said Whatever you do at the bottom	We do to the top	sd	4
Youre with me	Yes	b	1
You heard that one	Yes	b	1
5 x 25 is 125	I think I got it	sd	1
5 x 5 is		b	4
Something times five is going to give me 100		b	4
I could also think about something like	Skip counting	sd	4
5 x 2 equals 10 so 5 x 20 equals 100	I thought of that	sd	1
What	Then I did 20 x 2 I got 40	sd	5
Then I did 20 x 2 I got 40	No its 38	sd	2
How are you feeling	Good	ba	1
Youre remembering something	Okay	b	1
Okay	Got it	sd	1
Martin what have you got	I think its 04	sv	4
Youre so close Martin	Zero and 40	sd	4
Zero and 40	You add a zero here	sd	4
Is 410 equivalent to 40100	Yes	b	1
Was Martin super wrong	No	b	2
He gave us an equivalent decimal	He was super close	sd	2
He was super close he just needed that extra	Zero	sd	4
One two three	I can discuss other students rules and pictures on the coordinate grid and revise my work	sd	1
Colton can you read the blue	Yes	b	1
The top blue	Okay	b	1
Okay	Make sense of the problems	sd	1
Make sense of the problems	What are you being asked to do	sd	1
What are you being asked to do	How many answers do you need	sd	1
Pink Ruby	Using the appropriate process to solve the problem accurately	sd	1
Ari	Explain mathematical reasoning	sd	1
Explain mathematical reasoning	Proof why youre here why your process slash answer makes sense	sd	1
Okay and then the colorful one Alice	Use specific mathematical vocabulary numbers and pictures	sd	1
Use specific mathematical vocabulary numbers and pictures	Use labels and	sd	1
Who can read A	This shows	sd	1
Alice	This means	sd	1
Charlie C	This suggests	sd	1
D Auden	This calculation shows that	sd	1
Then Nolan can you read D	Yes	aa	1
F Cameron T	This mathematical thinking explains why	sd	1
Okay and Valentina H	I know this because	sd	1
A clipboard and a pen or colored pencil and give me a zero	Why is this thing on my desk	sd	1
Cora Connor Gabriella you can clip up in the second Santiago Alice Valentina Ari Ezekiel Ruby	I have a pen	sd	1
You go grab a	Im double but when I did it	sd	4
Auden	I did the front page but	sd	1
Adeline do you have yours	Yes	b	1
Give me a second	Now we have an even class	sd	4
I dont deserve that	I think that just switches that doesn t redo the whole thing	sv	1
Sorry friends I dont know why it does that	Lately its been bringing putting us back with the same like every two	sd	1
Lately its been bringing putting us back with the same like every two	Yes Ive been with  a lot	sd	1
Give me five	You need to press the redo	sd	1
Who are you with	Valentina	sd	1
Low voices working hard go	I couldnt figure it out so I couldnt do this so I got a brand new paper here so	sd	1
I couldnt figure it out so I couldnt do this so I got a brand new paper here so	We need the same thing we did with the xaxis and yaxis	sd	4
We need the same thing we did with the xaxis and yaxis	Let me just go ahead to it	sd	1
Let me just go ahead to it	20 minutes	sd	1
20 minutes	Lets be honest	sd	1
Are we ready	Yes	b	1
Is there another I	Is that I Owen	sd	1
Allie what do you know	Division is repeated subtraction but its the opposite of Instead of subtraction like writing it 4 minus 1 youre subtracting 24 divided by 8	sd	4
Good	Its the same as multiplication	sd	4
Is it the same or its the	The opposite of multiplication	sd	2
Yes	When you divide it theyre separated into groups	sd	5
She said	When you divide you separate it into groups	sd	5
When we think about groups is there another thing where were putting things into groups	Dividing	b	4
Dividing	No	b	2
No	Multiplication	aa	2
Were we doing some kind of grouping with fractions too	Yes	b	1
12 divided by 3	Thats the easiest one	sd	1
Thats the easiest one	Its easy	sd	1
Do you know what 12 divided by 3 is	Yes	b	1
Kai what are you thinking	12 divided by 3 is Let me see	sd	5
12 divided by 3 is Let me see	4 3s equals 12 so 3 divided by 12 equals 4	sd	5
Do you agree	Yes	b	2
We can think about the opposite of this 4 x 3	12	b	4
12	You could skip count	sd	4
You could skip count	Its kind of hard to remember	sd	1
I have 12 dots 3 dots in each circle and I ended up making	4 circles with 3 dots in them	sd	4
One by knowing the turn around facts in addition	Skip counting	sd	4
The sum is a clue that we have to Eli not a good time	Add	sd	4
Do we have an answer	Yes	b	1
20 divide by 5 is	4	b	4
You counted by 5	Yes	b	1
Yes	5 and	sd	1
Iliana	I figured it out by because I know 5 x 4  20 so I looked at the 20 and then looked at the 5 and I knew it was 20 because its 5 x 4	sd	5
Kai	I didnt do the same but this is an example	sd	2
I didnt do the same but this is an example	I quoted that in my mind maybe but I added 2 to the 3s because 3  2  5	sd	5
I quoted that in my mind maybe but I added 2 to the 3s because 3  2  5	The 5s get added by 2s which is 2 more divided by 2	sd	5
Im just not sure how that would help you solve this division problem	I only know it	sd	1
I only know it	I just said	sd	1
Eli whatd you do	We got	sd	1
We got	4 x 5  20 so	sd	5
You doublechecked your work by going back and trying the multiplication	Yes	b	1
Yes	What I did was think of 5 x 5 which is 25 and then I just subtracted 5 and got 20	sd	5
5 x 5 you used that fact that that was too much so you had to take one group away	Yes	b	1
Jaher what do you have	5	b	4
15 divided 3 equals 5	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Okay how do you know	Because I know that 15 divided by 2 No	sd	5
Because I know that 15 divided by 2 No	Because if I did that the opposite way it will still be skip counting and we also get 5  because we put everything  so	sd	5
Okay so you were counting up by 3s	Yes	b	1
Yes	I used	sd	1
I used	I thought 15 divided by 5 equals 3 so the answer might be 5	sd	5
Yes	I know  3 times 5 equals 15 so	sd	5
Do you remember that	Yes	b	1
Like subtraction the number that were breaking into pieces has to be our first number	Yes	b	1
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
15 divided by 3 is 5 15 divided by 5 is	Is three	sd	4
Could we say that	Yes	b	1
3 times 5 is 15	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Could we also say	Five times Yes	sd	4
Is that true	Yes	b	1
Ready to make this tricky	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
No	Yes	aa	1
Yes	Im ready for a challenge	sd	1
Instead I want to give you this problem	That one is a	sd	1
Whats our answer	5	b	4
Oh I have two different things to	5	b	4
5	5	b	2
5	5 5	b	2
5 5	5 5	b	2
Shes saying Sorry Emanuel its not 50 because	other one  to divide 15 from 3 and weve got 5 but the 0s  think of it if you didnt have the 0s it would still be the same	sd	5
other one  to divide 15 from 3 and weve got 5 but the 0s  think of it if you didnt have the 0s it would still be the same	I have	sd	1
Okay so you want to take the 0s off	Yes	b	1
ignore them and you end up with 5	Yes	b	1
Okay	because if its a 50 it would be 1005 or 1500	sd	5
Okay	3 x 5  15 plus youve got two zeros it equals	sd	5
Sonia what did you write down because I think that might help Emmanuel out too	What I did is I got 5 but I also did 30 times 5 equals 150 and  same thing because if you do 3 times 5	sd	5
She took  made a turnaround fact with multiplication and said Eli are you watching	Yes	b	1
Does that help	Yes	b	1
Yes	But	sd	1
Okay	If you use 5 it would be 5 because if you take one 0 and if you put a 5 there it wouldnt be true because	sd	5
If you use 5 it would be 5 because if you take one 0 and if you put a 5 there it wouldnt be true because	150 divided by 30	sd	5
Did you talk yourself out of what you were thinking	As long	sd	1
Are we good	Yes	b	1
Why this 5 works	Yes	b	1
Can we do repeated subtraction	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Okay	You could but	sd	4
Subtract another 30	Equals 60	sd	4
Subtract another 30	30	b	4
Subtract another 30	0	b	4
How many 30s are	We respectfully disagree with you	sd	2
Could you see how they were confused	Yes	b	1
in thinking we should have that zero on the end	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
All right you want to try something else	Yes	b	1
Hold on	harder	sd	1
harder	I like a challenge	sd	1
All right	It is 50	sd	4
Ezra what do you think	Its 50	sd	4
You think its 50	Yes	b	1
Because	If you take the two 0s from the 30 and the 50 If you take one 0 from the 50 and the 0 from the 30 and the two 0s from the  youll get 3 x 5  15 and then you add the two 0s back	sd	5
Okay so you got rid of these two because they could cancel each other out	No I got rid of that one	sd	5
No I got rid of that one	I went to that 30 one	sd	5
Okay so you got rid of Sorry you did these two	I got rid of those and I got rid of the two 0s on the 50 in the 500	sd	5
5 and I need to add	A 0	b	4
Am I totally losing some of you	No	b	1
Yes no	Yes	b	1
Are you ready to do some practice	Yes	b	1
Youve used these before	Yes	b	1
In this first equation number one	Have you covered up my numbers	sd	1
Have you covered up my numbers	No I didnt	sd	1
What is 24 divided by 8 Fiona	3	b	4
What would that be	It would be 30 and I know its 30 because if you take away the 0 from the 24 and you just divide it 8 you add the 0 from the 24 to the 30 and it goes to	sd	5
Youre going to go page 191 192 check imagine	Are we doing these	sd	1
Are we doing these	Yes	b	1
Yeah whats up	Do we simplify	sd	4
Whats your strategy	So I wrote 6 times 4 equals 24	sd	5
So I wrote 6 times 4 equals 24	So 24 divided by 4 would be 6	sd	5
Do you have an answer you would like to share or do you have a question for me	I have an answer	sd	1
I have an answer	I think its 6	sv	4
Can you tell us a little bit about your strategies	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I think 14 is	sv	1
I think 14 is	I dont really know how to explain it	sd	3
What were you saying then	14 is equal to	sd	1
What are we doing to 24	We multiply it	sd	4
Would anyone else like to share their strategy for this last one	Can I share	sd	1
Whoever said that from math land go for it	Um okay	b	1
Um okay	So what I do is I kind of think of 14 times 24 as 4 divided by 24	sd	5
You mean 24 divided by 4	Yeah	b	1
Okay	So if its like multiplication with fractions I always think of it as division	sd	4
Thats a great way to	I think of division as multiplication	sd	4
So if we are finding one Go ahead Charlie	Oh	b	1
Oh	So I kind of think of it as whenever I look at fractions with multiplication	sd	5
So I kind of think of it as whenever I look at fractions with multiplication	Instead of 14 times 24 I think of it as onefourth of 24	sd	5
How does that help you	because onefourth of 24 would be 6	sd	5
because onefourth of 24 would be 6	Thats basically saying 24 divided by 4	sd	5
Im glad youre here	Im sorry Im late	sd	1
I didnt see her show up earlier today	She joined late	sd	1
Did you have a chance to think about this one	Not really	sd	1
Okay	I didnt really understand	sd	3
What question	May I ask a question about that one	sd	3
Go for it Greta	Okay	b	1
Okay	So Im kind of confused on how it would	sd	3
So Im kind of confused on how it would	I thought it would be 4	sd	3
Okay	But Im just kind of confused on what it would be	sd	3
Would you like to tackle that answer that question Hunter	Sure	b	1
Go for it	Okay	b	1
Okay	So the only way I actually figured out how to do it was I figured out how half of 5 which is 25	sd	5
So the only way I actually figured out how to do it was I figured out how half of 5 which is 25	Then I split that in half because I have to take the 4 apart	sd	5
Then I split that in half because I have to take the 4 apart	I did Charlies strategy but kind of backwards	sd	5
I did Charlies strategy but kind of backwards	I thought of divided by 4 as onefourth of 5	sd	5
Were on the third one I think instead of the fourth one	Oh	b	1
Can I come back to you for the fourth one	Yeah	b	1
Go for it	Okay	b	1
Okay	So  thats 5 times 4	sv	5
So  thats 5 times 4	4 parts of 5	sd	5
4 parts of 5	So you have half of 5 which is 25	sd	5
So you have half of 5 which is 25	Then you half that half of 5	sd	5
Okay	Then I got 125 because 125 plus 125 equals 25	sd	5
So you thought about dividing it in half and then dividing it in half again to get 4 pieces	Yeah	b	1
That fraction bar means 5 divided by 4	But isnt the 5	sd	1
Emanual whats going to happen if you do that	Depends what color the blue is because if it was a really really dark blue Im pretty sure it would make it a lighter blue	sd	5
Yeah	When were done is it supposed to be	sd	1
Do you agree with that statement do you disagree with that statement or do you have a question about it	I agree with the statement	sd	4
How do you know that thats true	I love school	sd	1
Should 2 come first and 6 come second	Yeah	b	1
There are 3 tablespoons of blue paint for every cup of white paint	Disagree	sd	4
Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Juliet	I agree	aa	4
Tell us why you agree	because theres 1 cup of white paint and then theres	sd	5
So if this says for every cup of white paint there are 2 tablespoons of blue paint do you feel like thats true	No	b	1
Louisa do you agree disagree or have a question about that one	I think that that one is false because Oh no	sv	4
I think that that one is false because Oh no	Its true	sd	4
How come	because if you look at it theres 6 tablespoons on the picture	sd	5
because if you look at it theres 6 tablespoons on the picture	and then theres also 2 cups	sd	4
So Im looking at the one that says For each tablespoon of blue paint there are 3 cups of white paint	Oh sorry	b	1
Oh sorry	I think that that ones false	sv	4
Tell us why	because for 3 tablespoons of blue paint there is 1 cup	sd	5
because for 3 tablespoons of blue paint there is 1 cup	So it cant be where theres 1 tablespoon and theres 3 cups	sd	5
What do you think about that one	I dont have that one for my last one	sd	1
You dont	No its all different order	sd	1
No its all different order	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Its a mix	sd	1
Is everyones in different orders	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Lets look at the one Thats kind of tricky	but mines in a different order too	sd	1
What do you think about that one	Thats true	aa	4
How do you know	because it has it lined up	sd	5
because it has it lined up	I mean theres 6 tablespoons of blue paint and theres 2 cups of white paint	sd	5
I mean theres 6 tablespoons of blue paint and theres 2 cups of white paint	It says it in the order of 6 tablespoons of blue paint	sd	5
Yeah	It would be true because theres 2 tablespoons of white and 6 tablespoons of blue	sd	5
Were looking for a diagram thats representing 5 of something to 2 of something	Could it be sentence one	sd	4
Which one of these diagrams is representing 5 of something compared to 2 of something	Diagram D	sd	4
Hunter which one do you think it is	Just for sentence one	sd	1
Were looking for a diagram that is comparing 5 of something to 2 of something	Oh	b	1
Oh	I guess diagram C	sd	4
Yes	Will some be missing of the card	sd	1
Emanual check sentence four	Check sentence four	sd	1
Check sentence four	Im on sentence	sd	1
Im on sentence	I checked the sentence before	sd	1
I checked the sentence before	I dont have	sd	1
Sentence four or I guess sentence three Emanual	Yeah	b	1
Felix and Juliet you guys are on the right track	So what if theres some that dont have a match	sd	3
Everything will have at least one match	Okay	b	1
Okay	Can you help me with them	sd	3
Whats your question sweetie	So I got the first two or three of them but I when I go over to the next thing it says You got four cards out of	sd	1
So lets check sentence number three	All right	aa	1
So if you did	Oh	b	1
Oh	So Im guessing that it would be this one	sd	4
Yup	All right	aa	1
All right	But the rest of the cards I have them right	sd	4
But the rest of the cards I have them right	Right	b	1
Everything is correct so far yeah	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thank you	aa	1
Hunter would you check the one that has sentence four and sentence eight	Got it	sd	1
Check that one quickly	Just a question how is mine	sd	3
I think that you had done them first	Im confused on that one because it doesnt look like theres any one with only 1 spaghetti sauce	sd	3
Im confused on that one because it doesnt look like theres any one with only 1 spaghetti sauce	The only one that	sd	1
Yeah	The only one that does	sd	1
So a 1 to 3 ratio is also equivalent to a 2 to 6 ratio	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	T what do I do with the last two sentences	sd	3
Hunter sentence four or sentence eight one of those does not match diagram A	Okay	b	1
Itll just be a different way of describing it	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thank you	aa	1
So I want you to figure out which one does not match	T	b	1
Yeah Greta	Could you look at mine	sv	1
Yours is correct so far	All right	aa	1
Edgar either sentence one or sentence five does not match the diagram C Hi	Do we have to write them	sd	1
You dont need to	What is mine	sd	1
So youll need to figure out where sentence one goes	T	b	1
Yes Greta	Could you help me with sentence eight	sd	3
Sentence eight is going to match with one of your diagrams that you already have	Okay	b	1
Okay	I know itll be like 2 and 6	sd	4
Right	But I just cant really find 2 and 6	sd	3
Can you scale it up to something else	2 and Should I do	sd	1
2 and Should I do	Im not sure	sd	3
What would happen if we triple it	Would it be	ba	1
Would it be	I dont know	sd	3
See what happens when you triple it if you do three times as many	Like 3 times 2 and 6	sd	5
So instead of 1 cup youre going to do 1 2 3 when we multiply it by 3	So it could be 3 and 9	sd	4
So you want to look for a picture that has 3 tablespoons of oil so 3 squares and 2 circles for 2 cups of tomato sauce	You would have to take half of 3	sd	4
You want to switch it so you have it in the correct order	I dont	sd	1
Id like you to go back and revise the other ones	Im confused on sentence four	sd	3
Okay	Its kind of confusing because I dong get how they have 3 cups of tomato sauce for every tablespoon of oil	sd	3
If we draw a picture what would our picture look like	It would be 3 cups of tomato sauce and 1 tablespoon of oil	sd	4
So 3 circles right	Yeah	b	1
Then 1 square	But I dont have that	sd	1
On your paper I want you to draw 3 circles and 1 square	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Got it	sd	1
Whats going go happen	That would be a 6 and 2	sd	4
Do you see 6 and 2 anywhere	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Yeah	b	1
Which diagram is it	Diagram A	sd	4
Me too	Got it	sd	1
Got it	Thank you	aa	1
I love that youre asking me all these questions	I was wondering	sd	1
How can I help you	It says that one is wrong but Im not sure	sd	1
It says that one is wrong but Im not sure	I think its from sentence five	sv	1
What shape are we using	We use tomato slices so obviously its a square	sd	4
So tomato sauce is going to be purple	Okay	b	1
How are we representing oil	Would it be diagram D	sd	4
So you can move it and it can match that group	T could you check my work	sd	1
T could you check my work	Im pretty sure I did it	sd	1
So one more ear	Oh yeah youre right	aa	1
Oh yeah youre right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	He has	sd	1
He has	Misses Konz	sd	1
Yes sweetie	What are we supposed to do	sd	3
What are we supposed to do	So are we supposed to basically	sd	1
So are we supposed to basically	It says There are 3 cats in a room	sd	1
Ainsley what are your thoughts	Where we see aquatic animals	sd	1
Ooh aquatic animals	aquarium	aa	1
Aqua meaning what	Water	sd	1
You can go and do a behind the scenes meet and greet with their sloth which you would not normally typically find in an aquarium	They also have polar bears right	sd	1
Or is this a part to part to whole problem	Would it be part to part to whole	sd	4
Why are you thinking its part to part to whole	Maybe because theres numbers that are adding up to one	sd	5
What do you think our parts could be Danielle	Kids and chaperones	sd	4
Colten what should we put in that box for the total	Seventeen	sd	4
Howd you get 17	I just added 15 and 2 together	sd	4
Think about what you can maybe do next	I got my answer	sd	1
Elise what should we try next	Times five	sd	4
What can I do next to my ratio table to try and get the total to 85	Do 17 x 5	sd	4
Now did you know that 17 x five was 85	Yes	b	1
Clarissa will you share your strategy with us	That was my strategy	sd	1
Brendan	My strategy was I added the first column times two	sd	4
Okay	Then the next column times 3	sd	4
What did you multiply times three	The second column	sd	4
So that would be 90 and 12 and	102	b	4
Okay	Then I subtracted by the first column	sd	4
Colten can you tell me whats going to happen	I think that	sv	1
What do you need to take	Oh we need to do this problem	sd	1
to get to 8	Im not exactly sure oil	sd	3
How you got from 7 to 28	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I multiplied by 4	sd	4
Ellen what did you do	I times it by 2 and then times it by 2 again	sd	5
Ainsley is that what you got for your strategy	Yes	b	1
Im going to give you guys did three minutes feel like too much time or not enough time	Just the right time	sd	1
Just the right time	I think it wasnt enough time	sv	1
Why did she get four fourths and four fourths Tae	She  two wholes	sd	2
Luis and then Austin Luis can you come on up	I did one and four fourths	sd	5
I did one and four fourths	I did two wholes and onefourth	sd	5
How did you know theres two wholes	Because  so I knew that two was two wholes	sd	5
Awesome do you want to share	Yes	b	1
Yes	What I did I one fifth	sd	5
What I did I one fifth	I added 11 to three and I got 24 and then I just left the bottom like we learned the other day and and I got	sd	5
Wow and what is that bottom called	Its called	sd	1
She said I mark the denominator is that what youre saying	Yes	b	1
Silas	Where did you get the number	sd	4
What do you want to add on or say	I did it differently	sd	2
I did it differently	I did	sd	1
Nick can you explain what you did	What I did I set at one threefifths  and then another and then another one yes	sd	5
What I did I set at one threefifths  and then another and then another one yes	It had onefifth	sd	5
Can you share what you did	I added one	sd	4
Heres one whole and heres one whole and then this would be three of them	I added all of those	sd	4
Do you have an equation written down	For the two and threefifths I did five plus five for those two wholes I got 10 and I did threefifths  thirteenfifths and then I did one and onefifth so fivefifths plus onefifth and I got sixfifths and then I added those together to get nineteenfifths	sd	5
How did you know it was three and fourfifths	Because five plus five plus five is 15 and the 19 is	sd	5
What is one plus one plus one	Three	sd	4
Landon what do we do	The ones are whole and the ones that read isnt whole it would be	sd	4
How are you	Good	ba	1
Good	How are you	qy	1
Im sorry theres so much	Female SpeakerThats all right	sd	1
One two three show me your boards	Ive got a lot T	sd	1
Hunter		b	4
Who can give me a different one		b	4
	I just noticed thats just five times four equalS0 and two times four equals eight	sd	5
What do you mean	So you can do the five times four thatS0	sd	5
Eli	So if you just you can basically just multiply it times two	sd	4
So if you just you can basically just multiply it times two	This is just common knowledge	sd	4
This is just common knowledge	Dont you use the common denominators for this	sd	4
So really you just multiplied 22 to get 28  and thats equivalent	Yes mama	sd	1
Yes mama	I have one	sd	1
Okay erase your boards clean	I have 27108	sd	4

How did you get 15 over 24	No 16	sd	4
Oh 16	I know another one but I also noticed something	sd	1
I know another one but I also noticed something	If you just keep going in an order its adding two to the numerator and adding 3 to the denominator	sd	5
If you just keep going in an order its adding two to the numerator and adding 3 to the denominator	I noticed that too	sd	2
Hunter	100150	b	4
Okay erase your boards clean	20003000	b	4
Cameron give me one		b	4
Do you want to call on someone to help	The denominator would be 21 you would want to keep it at 21	sd	5
The denominator would be 21 you would want to keep it at 21	The numerator would have to be 9	sd	5
Natalie	2456	b	4
2456 Tyler	I didnt get that far that was all I had	sd	1
Whats five times three		b	4
Whats five times seven	I think 35	sv	4
Whats six times 3 SS		b	4
Okay whats eight times seven		b	4
Six times seven	Oh I said six	sd	4
Oh I said six	I forgot what I said	sd	1
I forgot what I said	Hold on okay	sd	1
Hold on okay	1842 got it	sd	4
1842 got it	Did I say 18	sd	2
Did I say 18	I said six right	sd	2
I said six right	Its 42	sd	2
Six times three and then six times seven 42  Hunter	48104	b	4
Savannah	3684	b	4
Yeah Miles	Because its just like doing five times three  which equals 15 except you just have to multiply the number above and like that the numerator and the denominator	sd	5
Because its just like doing five times three  which equals 15 except you just have to multiply the number above and like that the numerator and the denominator	But all you have to do multiply that and then you have the right answer	sd	5
Natalie	I would like to add on to Miles	sd	2
I would like to add on to Miles	By doing the same number times the numerator and denominator it will make it equivalent as  because you did the same thing for both the numerator and denominator	sd	5
Mmhmm  Kate	I also would like to add on	sd	2
I also would like to add on	It  works because its like when youre simplifying a fraction you would divide it by a whole number and  and you divide it by that and simplify the fraction	sd	5
It  works because its like when youre simplifying a fraction you would divide it by a whole number and  and you divide it by that and simplify the fraction	So the opposite of multiplying the fraction which would bea smaller fraction	sd	5
So the opposite of multiplying the fraction which would bea smaller fraction	So instead of simplifying it youre making it a bigger fraction so its just the opposite	sd	5

Masons ready	Page what please	sd	1
Go	T	b	1
T	Do the fives mean like this	sd	4
Bum bum de bum bum	Bum bum	sd	1
Do we think five times 12 is going to be greater than five	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
A half of five is greater than five	No	b	1
Okay Miles	It says to multiply	sd	4
Uhhuh	It says a multiplication symbol then why are we not multiplying	sd	3
We are  what is five times 12	Five times 12 so five seven and a half	sd	5
Remember fraction of problems Miles	Kind of	sd	1
And  you said you wanted half of those oranges thats this multiplication problem	Okay	b	1
Did I have to solve it to figure it out	Because even though a half is going to be smaller than its going to be the same number it just adds to the whole even though it starts bigger	sd	5
What do you think for B	For B I got that  five times two	sd	4
If this one is because its less than one why would this one be greater	Which one	aa	1
Okay sit down	Your mic is turned off again	aa	1
Brendan	I remember that	sd	1
Yes	And I remembered something from the last problem	sd	1
It becomes what Nolan	Smaller	sd	4
What do you notice and whats your reasoning	So I noticed that the 54 so the five is more than four	sd	5
So I noticed that the 54 so the five is more than four	So there was a six and four and I knew that that was more than five because six is more than five so	sd	5
Wait you mean four is more than	Well so theres five and 54	sd	5
Well so theres five and 54	And then theres 54 which is more than one so one plus five is six	sd	5
And then theres 54 which is more than one so one plus five is six	Now reminding you that six is more than the five	sd	5
Okay	So I knew that the 54 five and 54 is greater than 5	sd	4
Hunter	I agree with Leah but I see it in a different way	sd	2
I agree with Leah but I see it in a different way	I just say that since that one is greater than a whole  five parts is greater than a whole	sd	5
I just say that since that one is greater than a whole  five parts is greater than a whole	Five times one normally would be five and there would still be 1 point left and it would be54 would be greater	sd	5
Less than	Our product is going to be	sd	1
Less than you said it five	Yeah	b	1
What do we think Ben	I think that it is five times  86 and 87	sd	4
Daniel	8687 is not equal to one so it wouldnt be five if you did it	sd	5
Miles	I believe that the five would be greater because it is onethe other five times 8687 86 is still one lower than the whole total	sd	5
This is barely less than one	But it still means that the five is higher	sd	4
Okay	I have the answer to that one E	sd	4
Yes Eli	I noticed that its times one so it would be equal	sd	4
Miles do you  want to give it a go	Multiplication lost it	sd	4
Kate	Multiplicative identity property	sd	4
Are there a lot	Yes	b	1
Zachary	Five over five	sd	4
Savannah	Four  over four	sd	4
Natalie	10 over 10	sd	4
10 over 10	Seven over seven	sd	4
Could we keep going	Yes	b	1
So basically youre just doing equivalent fractions	Wait what does that mean when it says use the fractions	sd	3
What did you say	What does it mean by using the fractions for question B	sd	3
So for question B youre using for example is you wrote 22 youre multiplying 45 times  22 to get an equivalent fraction	Oh so whatever you use there you have to times it by	sd	4
Five over five yeah youre right	What numbers should we do if we finish this	sd	1
Left boxes	Are we going to do three and four together	sd	1
What information is missing	The numbers in between	sd	4
The four goes in the what place	Thousands	sd	4
Finn will you please read it for us	I can shade grids to represent and solve decimal addition and subtraction problems	sd	1
What did you guys all agree	We all agreed that it was model	sd	4
What does each of these columns represent	They represent the numbers	sd	4
Maybe I didnt ask the question correctly	A tenth	sd	4
If one column is a 10th what is one square Vicki	One hundredth	sd	4
I will know Im successful when I can Audrey will you read the success criteria for me	I will know when Im successful when I can accurately shade  explain my reasoning	sd	1
My what	Explain my rea	sd	1
Oh wait thats the word we just talked about	Representation	sd	4
When we explain what am I looking for in an explanation	Youre looking for specific	sd	4
Mariah	Ill take a big guess here	sd	1
Ill take a big guess here	When you learn new words and you dont use them you forget about them	sd	4
Look at the grid work with your face partner to answer these questions	Oh miss	ba	1
What	Can we  because	sd	1
How much Mariah will you read it please	How much will a  that represent the grid	sd	1
Vicki	Two tenths	sd	4
Stella	47 hundredths	sd	4
Cooper	67 hundredths	sd	4
Clay	One column is one tenth and one	sd	4
Is worth what	Is one tenth	sd	4
I think you said it correctly I just didnt hear you right	Then theres two columns so it would be two tenths	sd	4
Stella	There were four columns and the	sd	4
Okay so the four columns means what	Theres a	sd	1
The seven is	The seven is seven	sd	4
What	Hundredths	sd	4
How do you know that the six tenths is correct	Look on	sd	1
Everybody say Addend	Addend	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
You may work with your	Partner	sd	1
You guys have extra colored pencils	No	b	1
Are you good Penny	Yes	b	1
You did too many right	This is not shaded	sd	4
If we look at just his first one can you tell me Tell us about your picture	Yellow is the 54 and my regular pencil is 33	sd	4
Tell me about how you figured out the hundredth	the hundredth	sd	1
How did you decide what to do here	Theres one two three four five and I counted all the tenths and then I counted the ones	sd	4
You made the tenths first	Yes	b	1
Is this 54	Yes thats 54	ba	1
We have Oh wow tell me about how you did the 33 again	I  six right here and then I get 26 and then 26 plus seven equals 33	sd	5
Do you guys see that	Yes	b	1
Tell us what you did Angela	First I highlighted the 33 and then I  so I put a four here and then I colored  after	sd	4
Is your different	The way I did it is different	sd	2
Is that the most interesting one or do you want to talk about a different one	Just that one	sd	1
Just that one	What I did is I just first brought down the 33 and then there is  plus seven so	sd	4
Please dont do that	Seven plus three seven three and then when I got to this part I just brought down	sd	5
There should have been 54	I just made 10 by doing the seven here and then three down here and then I drew seven three	sd	5
The only other thing that I was looking for and I dont think anybody did it was there arent any rights or wrongs but just to have shaded them next to each other and then Can I share yours	Yes	b	1
What did you notice about it	They use two grids	sd	4
Can you please tell us about it Vicki	I shaded in 64 hundredths and then I knew that I need to cross out three tenths so I crossed out 3 rows of 10	sd	5
What was the answer	The answer was 34 hundredths	sd	4
Will you come show	I kind of	sd	1
Youre just going to explain it differently	Yes	b	1
Yes	Here are my two colored pencils and I colored you cant really see it but thats both of the colors and thats just pink and I colored in 64 hundredths first and then I used my other colored pencil and colored in the three tenths that I needed to cross out then I subtracted	sd	5
Do you guys all understand what she did	Yes	b	1
Come show us	So I did	sd	1
You did what they did	Actually I did differently	sd	2
Good	We used that one	sd	5
We used that one	I said orange is our starter like what we started with and then yellow is what were subtracting	sd	5
I said orange is our starter like what we started with and then yellow is what were subtracting	It doesnt show very well but that is 64	sd	5
It doesnt show very well but that is 64	64 and this is three tenths and	sd	5
Audrey	I think I did	sd	1
How are you going to show how are you going to use the shading to indicate what your answer is	Then we did what  showed	sd	1
What are these add up to here	180	b	4
Whats the first whats the first thing that would be easy to figure out X Y or Z	Y	b	4
Chris	subtract 76	aa	4
Someone online Can you unmute and tell me What would be the first thing that you notice in this diagram	The 47	sd	4
Christian what about the 47	Also Its a theres a right angle	sd	4
And so like Christian what would be your The first thing that you would do to solve this problem	Would it be a 90 minus 47	sd	4
So 47 plus y is going to equal 90 do you agree with that Christian	Oh yes	b	1
Okay Evan	That 47 is vertical to inaudible	sd	4
Okay so what we do now	47 minus x equals 180	sd	5
Say it again	2x equals 76	sd	4
Thats our vertical angles	You could also do Y plus 76 equals inauidble	sd	4
Like do we need to do substitution or elimination	Yeah	b	1
whats one equation we could write from this from this diagram	X plus Y equals Y minus x equals 180	sd	4
Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write	2x plus y plus x equals 180 2x plus	sd	4
Gavin	Crosstalk	sd	1
Go ahead Gavin	2X equals Y minus x	sd	4
Whats y	90	b	4
All right what do we think is is this equation or this equation gonna be easier to use	The second one	sd	4
And what do I need to do now to solve	inaudible 3x minus 90	sd	4
What do I need to do	inaudible	sd	1
You have a question	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Um so you always have to have two equations	sd	4
Um so you always have to have two equations	does it matter which one you use And like is there certain way you have to choose them	sd	4
someone online Whats the whats the simplest equation that we can write from this with the fewest amount of letters and numbers	Would it be 2x equals 4y	sd	4
Greg	3x plus y Plus 9 plus 4y inaudible	sd	4
And someone gave me one equation for the elimination That equals 180	3x is to y plus 3y minus x equals 180	sd	4
Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write that adds up to 180	We could do	sd	1
We could do	go ahead Rob	sd	1
go ahead Rob	or or you could do three y minus x plus y minus x equals 180	sd	4
So three y minus x plus y minus x does is that what you said Rob	Yeah	b	1
I guess Im thinking of like which of these because we simplify them Right	Oh Yeah	b	1
Its the dreaded last step	Check it	sd	4
Did you understand	You can subtract and make numbers	sd	4
Guys quiet with theboards please	Sorry I dropped it	sd	1

Why did you do 22 2	Because it says she ate 12 of 22 carrots	sd	5
We agree that Lauren ate Stevie	Yes	b	2
Not divided by	Fractions	aa	4

No you can just stay where you are	What	ba	1
Whitney do you want to talk about one or two or three	Im sorry that was my sister	sd	1
Im sorry that was my sister	Ill try three	sd	1
How do you think about that problem	I know  so I should just double eight so the answer would be 16	sd	5
How would the diagram help us solve that problem	diagram you can make eight squares and then after that one half and then once you do it with one half you get One second Im not sure how do it with the diagram	sd	5
Yeah Raul what do you think	I think it helps we can show it	sd	4
How can we show it	We can make a circle I guess with two	sd	4
Yeah Raul keep going	One and a half	sd	4
How would you solve that one	T	b	1
Yeah	Am I frozen to you	sd	1
Am I frozen to you	It looks like Im frozen	sd	1
You are frozen to me yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	Im going to leave the meeting and come back	sd	1
What does that mean	I would do	sd	1
How can we model problem number one	I think that we could model problem number one by  and then making it so that there is two groups of four	sd	5
I think that we could model problem number one by  and then making it so that there is two groups of four	four equals eight	sd	5
What have you  concession stand before	A fair	aa	4
A fair	Yeah	b	1
So have you guys ever been  McDonalds and how they sell the very popular quarter pounder	Yes	b	1
How much meat do you guys think the quarter pounder is	A quarter pound	sd	4
And I do think its before grilling that its a quarter of a pound but still thats there go to a quarter pounder	But I thought it was a Big Mac	sd	4
That is also their thing right	Yeah	b	1
Whats the difference between a Big Mac and a quarter pounder	You  quarter pounder but not as big	sd	4
Yes	I think Big Macs have two patties or theyre a half pound	sd	4
Im glad you guys have so much knowledge about this	Burgers	sd	1
Hello Amalia whats up	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	I didnt mean to	sd	1
So those seven eighths of a pound you can make seven one eighth pound patties	I have a question	sd	3
Sure	Im confused on how it wouldnt just be just seven not seven and an eighth	sd	3
Dos that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Or our equation	Seven eighths divided by two thirds	sd	4
Amalia whats different about the first problem that we solved from the second problem that we are solving	Um its two eighths instead of one eighth	sd	4
When you look at that diagram how much is left over Annie	Um is it one third	sd	4
How much space is that	So	b	1
Okay	Yeah	b	1
The person whose name comes last alphabetically is going to be runner today and thats going to be the person who comes back to me when you are ready to have your answers checked	And do we have to write	sd	1
Youre going to do your work in your notebook today	Okay	b	1
Okay	how do we draw on this	sd	1
how do we draw on this	On our model	sd	1
On our model	How do we show the models	sd	1
So whoever is your runners going to hold up their paper so I can see them	Okay	b	1
Does that sound all right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	seven eight	sd	1
Raul are you guys ready	Dude	aa	1
Hey team	Okay	b	1
Let me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Im going to check on the other	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	So we have to solve from the  from the	sd	4
So	one third  is divided by	sd	4
Yeah	solve the problem	sd	4
And Whitney what would your number sentence be	two and three fourths divided by one eighth	sd	4
Make sure that you are drawing a picture to represent that too okay Barbara	Okay	b	1
Yeah sweetie	So when we explain what your answer means what exactly are we just supposed to explain	sd	3
So once you have youre going to explain what it actually means	Okay	b	1
Are you guys ready	No its not	sd	1
No its not	Yes it is	sd	1
Yes it is	It is	aa	1
It is	No	b	1
Yeah	Hi	b	1
We can	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	So next question Raul	sd	1
Have you restarted  recently	No	b	1
That might help a lot	Yep	b	1
That might help a lot but do that after class okay	All right	aa	1
So	did mental math because I just thought of three divided by one to	sd	4
I would have them draw out a number or draw a diagram to help you take two and three fourths and divide into groups that are the size of one fourth	right now	aa	1
And then divide all of these up into fourths and see how many times one fourth will fit into two and three fourths okay	Wasnt	sd	1
Hey Astrid Im ready for you sweetie	Got it	sd	1
Got it	Okay	b	1
Okay	We	b	1
You guys are good to go to your next problem	common denominator	sd	4
Okay	I think were done	sd	1
Let me see	So heres	sd	1
what	No	b	1
Did you guys write yours with a common denominator	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	How many times just one 24ths go into 18 24ths	sd	4
Exactly	We should probably	sd	1
No it would be 18	Yeah	b	1
One 24th will go in 18 24ths 18 times	So its not 18	sd	4
Does that make sense crew	Yes	b	1
Look at your picture	I know	aa	1
So you basically said 18 24ths divided into groups that are the size of one 24th divided by	And then the  18	sd	2
If that makes sense	Yeah	b	1
Hey Beatrice hows it going sweetie	I got 11	sd	4
I got 11	We all got 11	sd	2
Whitney would you like me to check a problem for you	Yeah	b	1
One fourth	So we didnt really  11	sd	4

Charlie	87 and three tenths	sd	4
87 and three tenths	So three is basically almost just	sd	1
Say that again	87 and three tenths	sd	5
87 and three tenths	Three isn t a high number since you know what they say	sd	5
Three isn t a high number since you know what they say	Four and under stay five and up go	sd	5
Four and under stay five and up go	So you just let it slide	sd	5
You knew that this seven was your marker that that was the whole number	Yes	b	1
You looked and you just said Oh that s closest to the whole number of	87	b	4
Somebody take me through their thinking on this one	What I did is that I noticed that two thousandths is not bigger	sd	4
We don t have a two thousandths	Two hundredths is not bigger than five hundredths	sd	5
Two hundredths is not bigger than five hundredths	So I round it down	sd	5
Before you even did that what did you have to know	I had to know that you needed to just round the hundredths actually	sd	4
Don t you have to know where the tenths place is	Yes	b	1
You looked at the two in the hundredths right	Yes	b	1
Then what	Then I saw that it was below five	sd	5
Then I saw that it was below five	So you would leave it and change that to zero and keep 99 for one tenth	sd	5
Do you need a zero	No	b	1
No	You dont need one	sd	4

Remember that multiplication like 35 53 same thing right	I know that 20 5 is 4 so it is 4	sd	5
Hey everybody 35	Seven	sd	4
All right then what did you notice about these four	Theyre the same	sd	4
Why is it the same Matty	Because when youre doing times 15 youre doing 15 3 to get 3 but over there	sd	5
You mean 15 5	Yes and over there it doesnt show a fraction it just shows its divided by five	sd	4
Yes any other comments about this Franc	The one and the numerator we dont use that	sd	5
The one and the numerator we dont use that	So its the same number divided by five	sd	5

So now you have 3 so you need to multiply 33	Which is nine	sd	4
Yes so thats your answer here	Oh you should explain	aa	3
So this one 20 5 and then you look to your numerator and youve got to remember that you have to multiply what by whatever is there	Okay	b	1

Then how do you know	If theres four eight twelve so how are they forming a third	sd	3
If theres four eight twelve so how are they forming a third	Form one third is because four eight twelve thats a third right	sd	5
Form one third is because four eight twelve thats a third right	Oh like one	sd	1
Then you have to multiply by the numerator because whats 103	I want you to explain this	sd	3
Well you know you do this and its 20 5 times This is just going to be the same answers	I dont understand	sd	3
I dont understand	This is pretty long and this is wrong	sd	1

Nope Im gonna go back to that	Do you want us to write this down	sd	1
Okay	Ms Strathom  is it page 67	sd	1
	Okay	b	1
Okay	So you want us to write these on our whiteboard	sd	1
Using partial quotients	Ms Strathom	sd	1
Yes	I am confused	sd	3
I am confused	Where did you like why did you put the one next to the two at the top	sd	3
Its in my ones right	Yeah	b	1
Remember I have to use all the numbers within the dividend	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense Maddy	Yeah	b	1
Does it make better sense when I give you the arrows Maddy	Yeah	b	1
Yes Maya	Why did you do it times 20	sd	3
So 11 times 20 would be 220 which got me closer to my dividend	Okay thank you	sd	1
Please put your blue hand up	Can we use our boards	sd	1
So the rest of you are telling me you want to stay with me	Yes I need extra help	sd	3
I would solve that talk about how we did it and how we checked our answer	Okay we all solve it separate and then we all talk about how we each did it	sd	1
Okay Landon what part are you struggling with	Im struggling all the steps in the process	sd	3
Can you all see this	Yes	b	1
Maya go ahead	I kinda still dont understand how youve figured out which number to do it to get five like at the top to get the first five like 55	sd	3
Okay so youre not understanding why I put the number up here	Im not understanding how you knew how to get that number	sd	3
Oh I multiplied my divisor times that number	Okay	b	1
Do not fret because Im not sending you all the way unknown	Ms Strathom	sd	1
Yes	so Im inaudible number three and 3718 divided by 30	sd	5
so Im inaudible number three and 3718 divided by 30	And I got 117 remainder eight	sd	5
You are correct Adam	Yes	b	1
waiting here	Wait Is it for asynch	sd	1
Okay	Ms Strathom	sd	1
Yes Kate	so what are these like cube things for	sd	1
Thats for you to do your work in	Oh do we have to do it on that	sd	1
If we were in class that I could look at those	Ill do it on the grid	sd	1
Ill do it on the grid	I only did one on my whiteboard which I think you guys already solved that	sd	1
Adam Do you have a question	Um yeah	b	1
Um yeah	So my mom and I think I have this down	sd	1
Okay	Miss Miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes Maddy	Um so can I come with you at one because I thought I had it but Im actually very confused	sd	3
What was our benchmark fraction Manny	I was going to tell you I cant find the comparing fractions	sd	1
Then youre going to at the top of a new page of notes youre going to put the title again	Okay	b	1
What is the fraction that we were using to compare fractions	I know	aa	1
What is it	One on top of two	sd	4
So now what I need to do is I need to create another number line that is the exact same size for three fifths but this time how many pieces am I going to put on my number line	Two and three	sd	4
If Im three fifths	I think that you put five	sv	4
Im sorry greater than or lesser than one half	Greater	sd	4
How do you know that	Because if you really look at it closely the dots on the bottom where the fractions are if you connect to them together its not a straight line	sd	5
Because if you really look at it closely the dots on the bottom where the fractions are if you connect to them together its not a straight line	Its like a diagonal line	sd	5
So Ive created another number line for my three fourths but now on this number line how many pieces am I going to add	I think that you would have four and then you would mark your three at the point right next to the end	sv	1
Well which one is bigger	I think its three fourths because it is in a bigger spot on the number line	sd	5
So I said the bigger the denominator	The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	sd	4
So Im going to let them have that choice	Im done	sd	1
I saw your hands help me out	I feel like the three fifths would be bigger because on ST math when I was doing my the ones the fracks or whatever its called the bigger it got the smaller the blocks were	sd	5
I feel like the three fifths would be bigger because on ST math when I was doing my the ones the fracks or whatever its called the bigger it got the smaller the blocks were	So I think three is bigger because of that	sd	5
Three fifths or four fifths	one of them says three fifths because when you get bigger numbers then the pieces are smaller	sd	5
Aries what are you thinking	If you had a two circles and you wait actually let me think about this	sd	1
I have two circles	I think I agree because on the first circle put in three three things or whatever	sd	5
Well how many pieces do I have in all in this circle	One whole	sd	4
The numerator or the denominator tells me	I cut the five pieces	sd	4
Then how many of those am I going to fill in Aries	Three	sd	4
Okay	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Im disagreeing now	sd	2
Im disagreeing now	Because when because if you color it if you do the same thing in the other one and color four in theres more	sd	5
Oh my goodness because they have the same what	Same what do you call it	sd	3
Same what do you call it	They have the same denominator	sd	2
So which one is bigger	Four fifths	aa	4
Which one has smaller pieces Adeline	Four eighths	aa	4
Adeline	The four fifths	sd	4
Looking for hands Tracy What do you think	The two one thousandths	sd	4
Two one thousandths	Because 1000 is 10 times bigger than the 10	sd	5
So how many pieces does that tell me is going to be in this shape	Like number	sd	1
How man pieces in all	1234	b	4
Based on my denominator	Oh one thousand	sd	4
Are these pieces really big or are they really small	Theyre super super super super super small	sd	4
Aries what are you thinking	Its actually the two tenths because when you colored two in the thousands you barely even see it but in the two tenths when you make like 10 color two its going to be more bigger compared to the other one	sd	5
So I have 10 here and Im going to fill in two of them	If you fill in two in 1000 its going to be tiny	sd	4
Tracy if youre talking to us we cannot hear you	Oh sorry I went to the bathroom	sd	1
Did you see what we just did	No	b	1
So lets see who can explain what we just did	So we drew a circle of 1000 lines	sd	4
Yeah	We think its 1000 but so we put two in there and it was smaller	sd	5
We think its 1000 but so we put two in there and it was smaller	But when we did it in the two tenths it was a lot more bigger than in the two thousands	sd	5
But when we did it in the two tenths it was a lot more bigger than in the two thousands	And so we think its too tenths because its a lot more bigger than 2 thousandths I think	sd	5
Aries	Oh what was I going to say	sd	1
Oh what was I going to say	Do you know how it says two thousandths	sd	1
Do you know how it says two thousandths	It kind of sounds like 2000 you know	sd	1
It kind of sounds like 2000 you know	It kind of sounds like that	sd	1
So lets do number one together who can read number one on my screen Meaghan read it out loud and proud	Using greater or less than compare each fraction	sd	1
And what are the two fractions that we were comparing	Four sevenths four out of seven and then five out of seven	sd	4
Four sevenths four out of seven and then five out of seven	And I think that four out of seven would be bigger because five out of seven would be a little bit smaller due to the its the same denominator and then the denominators are pretty big but the numerator is smaller	sd	5
And I think that four out of seven would be bigger because five out of seven would be a little bit smaller due to the its the same denominator and then the denominators are pretty big but the numerator is smaller	As I think that the bigger one would be the the smaller numerator	sd	5
Vivian tell me what you think	I think four sevenths is bigger because if you draw a picture you see that theres less pieces but there would be more to shade in	sd	5
I think four sevenths is bigger because if you draw a picture you see that theres less pieces but there would be more to shade in	Im confusing	sd	1
Im confusing	The denominator with the numerator	sd	4
Just focus on four sevenths how am I going to draw it	Six lines	sd	4
Six lines	And that will make sevenths	sd	4
Or how many pieces did I have in all	Huh	b	1
How many pieces in all for five sevenths	Seven	sd	4
Okay hold on a second which ones bigger	The one on the bottom	sd	4
Maddy will let you write your name	Yeah it will	sd	1
Could you turn your microphone on	Yes	b	1
go ahead	Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	sd	5
Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	And they each need to get the same amount	sd	5
And they each need to get the same amount	So if I divide if like I give each rabbit or like the six carrots goes into the rabbits twice I guess I	sd	5
What did your expression look like	So first I did 8 divided by two plus three	sd	5
Why did you do eight divided by two buddy	Nevermind	sd	1
Yeah can you	Yeah	b	1
Yeah you do	Um Landon	sd	1
Go ahead Landon	Okay so I was a little confused on this one	sd	3
Okay so I was a little confused on this one	But I said four divided by two plus three	sd	5
Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on	Hello	sd	1
Can you walk them through this	Yes	b	1
Yes	So can I explain what I did	sd	1
So can I explain what I did	And then walk them through it	sd	1
Please do because I need to make sure youre correct	Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	sd	5
Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	So you do that first	sv	5
So you do that first	And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	sd	5
And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	So you need to do that first	sv	5
So you need to do that first	And then he has three cages	sd	5
And then he has three cages	So I did two plus four in parentheses divided by three	sd	5
because you had to divide those rabbits into	Three cages	sd	4
Landon turn your microphone back on	Okay	b	1
Tell me what Maddy just said	She said that she did in parentheses four plus two which is six and then shes did six divided by three which is inauidble	sd	5
Does that make sense Landon	Yeah	b	1
What Maddy did	Yes	b	1
Where did you come up with 8 buddy	inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	sd	5
inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	So now Im actually solving it	sd	1
So now Im actually solving it	I dont know where I got eight from	sd	3
Turn your microphone on please	Yes	b	1
Tell me what how you solved this	I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds	sd	4
John can you explain what you did	Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds	sd	4
How can you cut it into thirds John	Well inauidble And I said each person could get 13 of the pizza	sd	4
Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on	You can cut them both into thirds	sd	4
ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much	Two thirds	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Can you turn your microphone on buddy	Yeah	b	1
So Ethan how did you solve this	I did it	sd	1
I did it	I split to six graham crackers in half	sd	5
I split to six graham crackers in half	And then so each of them got on one and one half of two graham crackers	sd	5
Kate do you agree or disagree with that	Well I did it differently	sd	2
Okay so explain what you did please	Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	sd	5
Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	Because there were three people or three friends	sd	5
Because there were three people or three friends	Oh I would have to cut it into fourths	sd	5
What does that come up with	At first I did it in third	sd	5
At first I did it in third	When I did it in thirds	sd	5
When I did it in thirds	I got two wholes	sd	5
I got two wholes	They would each get two wholes	sd	5
They would each get two wholes	But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	sd	5
But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	Because I need to do her two	sd	5
Because I need to do her two	So they would each get one and a half	sd	5
So they would each get one and a half	So yeah now I agree	aa	2
Kate what	Its number five	sd	1
Or do you need to work with me	I think I have it	sd	1
So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between	Oh god	ba	1
Oh god	Um three	sd	4
What about Mary	Three	sd	4
So we have three total people right	Yeah	b	1
Right	Yup	aa	1
Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here	Uh you could draw pizza slices maybe and you split it into thirds	sd	4
Adam how much pizza did each person get	A third	sd	4
So if it would make it easier I could do 13	plus 13 plus 13	sd	4
That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam	three thirds or a whole	sd	4
What question Can I clarify	I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	sd	1
I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	I was just saying kinda cause	sd	1
So you were just doing the two you were doing this number	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	I forgot to add the person whos like the first person	sd	4
What How am I cutting them into fractions	circles	sd	4
Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can	One and a half	sd	4
I have my five cans right	three cans	sd	1
What am I dividing those cans into	Thirds	sd	4
Why third	Mrs Strathom I know	sd	1
What do I need to divide these cans into	fifths	aa	4
fifths	Fifths	aa	2
Audrey	because shes gone for five days	sd	5
Three what Everybody	Three fifteenths	sd	4
Three fifteenths	cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each	sd	5
How many days Is she going to be gone Adam	three fifths	sd	4
cameras on	If we didnt Finish Do we finish it for asynchronous	sd	1
camera on camera on camera on camera Camera on Camera on	Mom I still have a question	sd	2
Whats your question Adam	So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something	sd	5
Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get	three fifths	sd	4
make sense	Yeah	b	1
And if your camera doesnt go on I did not know youre with me	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes	They probably still have you muted	sd	1
So where else do you think you revised relook at something and make changes	If you so say that youre writing something and you spelt a words wrong  typing you have to go back and redo it	sd	4
Nate	Lets say I go home and I am making eggs and I may have	sd	4
Lets say I go home and I am making eggs and I may have	Broke an egg when I wanted the egg not to break and I could fix it and do another egg	sd	4
Laura	Like in horseback riding you take a video of yourself riding so you can look back and revise on what you could do better	sd	4
Like in horseback riding you take a video of yourself riding so you can look back and revise on what you could do better	In art if youre making a design and you dont like it you can go back and change it	sd	2
In art if youre making a design and you dont like it you can go back and change it	Basically what all I heard is that you can make something and then go look back on it and edit it basically	sd	4
Basically what all I heard is that you can make something and then go look back on it and edit it basically	I think thats what everybodys trying to say	sv	2
Revise their thinking about it like editing	Yeah make it better	sd	4
Kate	When youre doing something	sd	1
When youre doing something	When you take a video of yourself you can always look back on it and figure out how you can fix it	sd	4
Miles	Too I think for math this means like go back look at it	sv	4
Too I think for math this means like go back look at it	And this could be useful in real life too because when youre revising on Lets say youre taking a big college test for a masters degree or something	sd	5
And this could be useful in real life too because when youre revising on Lets say youre taking a big college test for a masters degree or something	And if you get too many questions wrong youll probably not get the masters degree so you want to look back revise	sv	5
And if you get too many questions wrong youll probably not get the masters degree so you want to look back revise	Make sure every single question is how you liked it	sd	5
Ariana	If you were at cheer they take videos of us so we can take a look at it and fix our work	sd	4
Hudson	So you can look back on it and fix it if you did something wrong	sd	4
Mason	Our paper for our clothing	sd	4
Miles	This doesnt make You cant have a mistake in the rule can you	sd	4
A larger	Book	aa	4
Noah	I think I know the mistake	sd	1
Bullet point it on your whiteboard	I cant even write with this marker	sd	1
I cant even write with this marker	I have an extra one	sd	1
Need another one	I have one right here if you want to use this	sd	1
I have one right here if you want to use this	Thank you Nate	sd	1
Thank you Nate	Do you want it back soon	sd	1
Do you want it back soon	You can have it if you want it	sd	1
You can have it if you want it	Thank you	aa	1
The book is not larger so the first misconception I noticed is the book is	Theres only one misconception	sd	4
No theres two	What is it then	sd	3
What else	Theres not many straight lines	sd	4
Natalie	The book is in a different place than before	sd	4
Kate	I remember there were zeroes on x and  They must have multiplied that by And not set it with a zero and it was the number they multiplied it by	sd	4
Where they	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	They used addition instead of multiplication	sd	4
They used addition somewhere	Clearly	b	1
Clearly	They used addition for their whole rule	sd	4
They used addition for their whole rule	Thats the	ba	1
Miles	There is no origin	sd	4
There is no origin	Its not at	sd	1
Its not at	Not all	sd	1
Not all	What Im basically saying is its in the middle	sd	4
This one youre also going to find that the misconception on your own but youre going to	Check with a partner	sd	4
Lets look at the first part	Wait so this is an actual student	sd	1
Uhhuh	In our class right now	sd	1
So they said the X coordinate by six the folder will be taller	I dont see the misconception	sd	1
I dont see the misconception	I might see it	sd	1
I might see it	I see it	sd	1
So they said	Oh they multiply both parts	sd	4
So they said theyre going to multiply the X coordinate by six	They multiplied both by six	sd	4
Only one that you cant see and they have 12 0	Are these students actually in the class	sd	1
No	Wait didnt you write about something that he may have said like earlier	sd	1
Hudson	That it should be wider not taller and filled by 2 both the yaxis and xaxis which makes it zero	sd	5
Good	Yes I agree	sd	2
Okay	Wait why is the one so small and the other ones like	sd	3
Wait why is the one so small and the other ones like	Maybe timesed it by two instead of by three or maybe	sd	2
Today when you are going back to your number five you are going to be comparing your number five to a math CER which you are going to put in the math section of your binder and its just going to stay there forever	Really	aa	1
Yep	Are we just going to use it whenever we look at it	sd	1
Natalie	First of all the student didnt use complete sentences	sd	4
Hunter	He didnt really say what he was going to do like he did something else than what he said	sd	4
Ariana	He didnt make any sense of what he meant of it got taller	sd	4
Kate	He didnt have a mathematical concept	sd	4
Hudson	He couldve explained how his prediction was proved and what he did to get his answer	sd	4
Laura	I really think he just needed to add more explaining and how he thought to that point and what is it	sd	4
Tyler	He didnt really add many mathematical words in his response	sd	4
Or her	Thats what I said he or her	sd	1
Is it recording	Yes	b	1
Can you tell	Its recording	sd	1
Its recording	Yes it is	sd	1
Im going to look and see what it wants you to do	Which ones greater	sd	1
Write that on your slates	That makes sense	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Write it on your slates	Which one of those is bigger	sd	1
Kinsley	Because 14  24 is 34 which is greater than 12	sd	5
Eliza	I know that 24 equals 12 and the  but plus 14 is bigger	sd	5
Write it on your board please	I get it now	sd	1
12 is greater because we know that 28  18 equals	38	b	4
And 12 is	48	b	4
48	Yes	b	1
Rita explain how you knew	I know that 13  13 is bigger because theyre not the same denominator we have to convert both of those to 6 so 13  26 plus 26	sd	5
I know that 13  13 is bigger because theyre not the same denominator we have to convert both of those to 6 so 13  26 plus 26	Then 12  36 and and 46 is	sd	5
Can you picture it in your head	Yes	b	1
Is it more or less than 13	More	aa	4
More	More	aa	2
Rita youre totally right and everything you did is correct but were just working on that mental math	Can I explain mine	sd	1
Were going to do math message	Math Message	sd	1
I know some of you want to do this in your head so badly you cant even stand it but I want you to use your fraction sample cases for this one okay	Are all the fractions different	sd	3
I think the eights are purple	Dark or light	b	3
Dark or light	This or this	sd	3
This or this	It has to be a different number	sd	4
wasnt it	Whats dark blue and light blue	sd	3
What have you been asked to do right now	Do this	sd	1
Yes	The eight	sd	4
The eight	18 and 14	sd	2
18 and 14	Look at the edge for the red or the orange one	sd	4
Look at the edge for the red or the orange one	That looks nice	sd	1
That looks nice	Wait we shouldnt be saying out loud	sd	1
Wait we shouldnt be saying out loud	Im confused I put them together	sd	1
Well put the six over the edge there	Shh be quiet guys	sd	1
Shh be quiet guys	Whats up dog	sd	1
Yes thats fine	Oh she got it	sd	1
Oh she got it	Yes but it doesnt	sd	1
Hes going to be coming up and bringing them up	What the heck	sd	1
What the heck	I just really want to bring donuts in	sd	1
I just really want to bring donuts in	Its not because its the last day until break	sd	1
I dont know	I dont even think donuts Friday exists	sd	1
I dont even think donuts Friday exists	Ive never seen her dad before	sd	1
Thats fine Maya	He should be here any minute	sd	1
Ezra	It was 18	sd	4
Continue to share	What we did we had 14 and then we did like this and then we knew that wasnt enough so we just put two more 4s 18 on top of the 4 and then the 2	sd	5
What we did we had 14 and then we did like this and then we knew that wasnt enough so we just put two more 4s 18 on top of the 4 and then the 2	Then 2  3 would be 4	sd	5
You put 28 on top of the 4	Yes	b	1
Then you have one more 18	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Then you knew you had 38	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Eliza show your thinking please	I know that four	sd	1
Wait shes  Okay youll talk later	because 4 x 2 will be 8 so its 14 would be 28	sd	5
Thank you	Im going to have them at the end of the day	sd	1
Im going to have them at the end of the day	Your daddy	sd	1
Your daddy	Your dad is nice	sd	1
Your dad is nice	Heres your doughnut	aa	1
Caroline	I did something different	sd	2
I did something different	I put 14 and then 18 and then I looked to see what could I put that will be bigger	sd	5
I put 14 and then 18 and then I looked to see what could I put that will be bigger	I found that 23	sd	5
Bella	I dont know where my fraction circles went	sd	1
Okay	instead I drew it on my slate	sd	1
instead I drew it on my slate	I drew one with 14s and one with 18s	sd	5
Okay	Then I wrote under them 14 and 18 and then I split the 14 one up as a 18	sd	5
Then I wrote under them 14 and 18 and then I split the 14 one up as a 18	Then I put an arrow down and put 28 and then I put 28  18  38	sd	5
Go	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Do we have to do the whole fraction	sd	1
Whats the quick common denominator everybody		b	4
Or		b	4
What else		b	4
		b	4
20 and 40 for the first one	Yes	b	2
The next two 28 and		b	4
Kynan Im going to have you go to the table group	I think we should use	sd	1
What do you think	I think the end number	sd	4
You have about one more minute	Yes but what about	sd	1
Youre at a zero	Im number two	sd	1
Tell me what you got Georgia	I got 3 through 15 because	sd	4
Im sorry what	3 through 15	aa	4
Is that what you guys are going to do	Yes	b	1
To group number two what are you guys going to do	We said were going to draw a number on and then 4 14 through 7 34	sd	4
4 14 and what	7 34	b	4
So would that mean I go 4 12 4 34 5 and so on	Then five and so on yes	sd	1
Then five and so on yes	Yes	b	2
Well group number three what are you guys going to do	We did 3 through 7 34	sd	4
Thats what you did	No	b	1
No	We did it in fourths	sd	4
We did it in fourths	We did 3 and then 3 14 then 3 24	sd	5
Am I doing this the way you did it	Yes	b	1
4 and 4 14	Can I come up and explain	sd	1
You need to be able to explain from where youre at	We did 3 14 and then 3 24 and then 3 34	sd	5
Table group five what did you guys do	What we did was we did 3 14 all the way to 7 34	sd	4
What we did was we did 3 14 all the way to 7 34	Yes its 3 14 all the way up to 7 34	sd	2
Did you do 34 for each number or did you do 3 34 4 4 14 4 24 4 34 4 44	Yes	b	1
Table group number six what did you do	Were going to use the number of 4 14 up to 7 34	sd	4
Am I really going to want to graph something that big	No	b	1
So what is my smallest number	3 34	b	4
What do you think my next numbers should be	4 14	b	4
Why wouldnt I just be able to go 34	Because of those	sd	1
Whos got a pencil that small	Its not mine	sd	1
So now looking at the way I did it Im not going to go 14 24 34 44 am I	No	b	1
Could I	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes you could	aa	2
Could I do that	Yes	b	1
Would that be a more efficient way to do it	Yes	b	1
Is it an efficient way to write 14 24 34 44 in between each number	No	b	1
But could I	Yes	b	1
Could I do that	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Do you understand why	No	b	1
What do you not understand	Well why would you start in 3 14 and the go to 3 12	sd	3
Well why would you start in 3 14 and the go to 3 12	That doesnt make sense why it would	sd	3
I said I wouldnt use the 14	Oh	b	1
Why is that a more efficient way to do it Marco	Because youre doing a 12 and you dont have to do 14 24 34 and everything	sd	5
Because if these are going to be between 3 12 3 and 3 12 or 3 12 and 4 right	Yes	b	1
Camiela does that make sense to you	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense to everyone else	Yes	b	1
do we agree though that we should always go smallest to largest	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
We always agree	Yes	b	1
Notice on a line plot do I have numbers that go up the side	No	b	1
We are actually going to graphics doing it the way that I said	Yes	b	1
Take a random four	Do you want me to go first	sd	1
You should not have two	Okay	b	1
This should not take a long time	No	b	1
So Im a little confused because it doesnt look like I have any pencils the exact same lenght	7 34	b	4
That looks like there is two there that might be next that are in a line with one another	Wait do we have Could we coverup others sticky notes	sd	1
If I am doing data using axes like we talked about shouldnt my data look like this when its up on the board	Yes	b	1
Yes	Sure	b	2
Sure	Yes	b	2
Yes	Oh wow	ba	1
Im still not certain if that one was	It looks like too bad	sd	1
Is my data easier to read that way	Yes	b	1
Than the way you all did it	Yes	b	1
How important is it that theyd be in a line	Very	sd	4
What is the name of what we are creating	Line plot	sd	4
Line plot	All right	aa	1
Not a funny little graph a line plot	Plot	sd	1
A line goes this way	A plot goes that way	sd	4
or a plot goes up right	Up	b	1
How vitally important is it that my numbers be stacked	Very	sd	4
Let me get this now	Yes got its 205	sd	4
Yes got its 205		b	2
	Okay 205	b	2
Cate	Its not 205	sd	4
Its not 205	206	b	2
206	Probably	sd	2
	Thats wrong	sd	2
Thats wrong	All of them	sd	1
All of them	Two of them added	sd	4
Two of them added	Oh there	sd	1
We are going to do it quick	We could	sd	1
Pencil right	Yes	b	1
What was our smallest number that we were going to use	Three and four	sd	4
Three and four	Seven	sd	2
If I do it this way	Like you put it on top a little more	sd	4
Is that an easier way to do it	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
It should be pencil length	All right	b	1
And this is what is the measurement that we used	Nearest to four	sd	4
My seven is not clear enough	See values	sd	1
See values	Wheres the clip and the chain	sd	1
Well if you did your plot the way I did mine youve got youre able to determine where its at	All right	aa	1
All right	If you wrote your plot line the way I wrote mine youre able to determine that	sd	4
If you wrote your plot line the way I wrote mine youre able to determine that	Oh	b	1
Oh	Wow	ba	1
Not sure what youre doing out there Asher and Latoya	I cant see the	sd	1
What	On the form that looks like on the side the one	sd	4
Based off that measurement up there that pencil is not even two inches and they shouldnt be using it	Oh the	ba	1
I said	That is 5	ba	4
Im sorry	Thats like one and three	sd	4
Whats the largest value in the data stack	7 34	b	4
Whats the smallest	3 34	b	4
A good number to start with		b	4
Good number to end with or I mean could I have started with 3 12	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
Its easier to do it in 12 isnt it	Yes	b	1
My friends now the fun one begun	What	ba	1
What	The fun one	sd	1
This only goes	Five feet	sd	4
Stand straight for me	Oh God shes tall	sd	1
You are 60 tall	Five feet	sd	4
Would I write 5 feet or 60	60	b	4
Hes ready to jump of his chair	Instead of 5 feet or 60  to the nearest 12	sd	4
Instead of 5 feet or 60  to the nearest 12	We have to	sd	1
If shes exactly 60 what would I put her at	30 12	b	4
How did I cut her in half	30 half inches	sd	4
What would you write		b	4
Come and get a tape measure and go	We dont even know if that	sd	1
What are we	Humans	sd	4
What kind of students	Fifth grade students	sd	4
Oh	We are humans	sd	4
We are humans	Second grade students	sd	1
Grade students	We act like second grade students	sd	1
Okay and what did we measure it in	Half inches	sd	2
Go	Im 4 10	sd	4
I shouldnt see 4 10 I should see inches	54	b	4
54	No	b	2
No	58	b	4
Dont do it on the board	No its 58	sd	4
Liz you need to go down in between Clay and	Bruce	aa	4
You shouldnt have that in your hand at all	Bless you	sd	1
What is your measurement	52 12	b	4
What is yours		b	4
The smallest is 52 12 and the largest is 66 12	Jesus youre huge	sd	1
How should I do it	52 12 53 53 12	sd	4
Am I going to make it	No	b	1
Count up by a whole	Yes	b	1
The reason you are not writing this is I want yours to be done the right way	Isnt that like a	sd	1
Opps	Opps she covered the line	sd	1
All right 52 12 53 12 54 12	You were doing it	sd	4
I have to scratch that out because I cant see it	Since we have 52	sd	4
55 12 56 12 57 12 58 12 59 12 60 12 61 12 62 12 63 12 64 12 65 12	he was taller than that	sd	4
CIndy you are easy go put yours over on the board	Yes	aa	1
They measured you wrong youre going to stick to what  This should not be in a line those first three should be on top of one another I am assuming	Its 54 12	sd	4
Its 54 12	52 54 and 55	sd	4
I can tell you that right now	Well thats  some	ba	1
What is your say		b	4
58 Liz whats your say	58 12	b	4
58 12	Mine is 56	sd	4
Mine is 56	Mines 54 12	sd	2
Go do it	Im measuring this	sd	4
Im measuring this	Like	sd	1
Like	Its like 54 now	sd	4
Okay all right		b	4
	57 and	sd	2
57 and	I know its going to be difficult for you	sd	1
Bless you	Thank you	aa	1
Go	Ms Ms Strathom do you want me on the table	sd	1
You dont have one so you dont need to worry about it	Ms Ms Strathom can you come	sd	1
Ms Ms Strathom can you come	No you can do this Addison	sd	1
Addison dont automatically say you dont know how to do it	I dont	sd	1
What do you need to do	A common denominator	sd	4
No weve already got a common denominator	I cant do minus 23	sd	4
Why cant you	Because	sd	1
What can I do	You add a common denominator	sd	4
No what do I need to do from that whole	Take some from here	sd	4
Franc	Yes	b	1
Clay do you have a partner here	No	b	1
You have to come to a consensus	Because if you cant subtract 13 that is supposed to be a two but then you would add a whole to that so yes thatll make it 31 is 43 and then you subtract with the 43	sv	5
the same	The one with fractions they both have the same denominator for each problem	sd	4
How are they different Clay	The answers of one and two are bigger	sd	4
Kayla were you able to solve problem one in your head	Yes	b	1
How come	Because they have the same denominator and the top denominator was bigger than the bottom denominator	sd	5
What is that called	The numerator	sd	4
The numerators	The numerator was bigger than the other numerator so you would do just 41 and it was 3	sd	5
Could you please do that again	You would do 41 and that would be 3 and then that will be 35 and that one will be 3 so it will be 3 35	sd	5
Ms Clay were you able to do the second one in your head as easily as you were able to do the first one	The first one was easy	sd	4
Okay explain to me why	On the second one you can subtract 31 but you cant subtract 1323 because theyre smaller so I had to take a little bit from the whole and then I turn the whole into two and then put the rest on the fractions and then I got 43	sd	5
So you had to take a little bit from the three	Yes	b	1
Franc how much of a little bit did she take	One whole	sd	4
How many then is she adding to that 13	She got in 33 to 13 or 1 13 so thats what brought her to 13	sd	5
Am I correct	Yes	b	1
When you borrowed you suddenly made it 11 am I correct	Yes	b	1
Yes	I made it 11	sd	1
What did you make it honey	I made it 43	sd	4
What did you make it Stan	I was pointing to her	sd	2
ShBrucely what did you make it	I made it 113	sd	4
I made it 113	I made it 113	sd	2
How many of you made it 113	I made it	sd	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Did I give out round 2 of the 10 ego box	No	b	1
I wrote them I just didnt give them out	10 ego box	b	1
10 ego box	We actually got 20	sd	1
Okay did you agree on your estimation	Yes	b	2
Yes	I got Never mind	sd	1
What do you mean by that	Because me and Joshua agreed on both of them but then Stan didnt get it	sd	2
What did you and Joshua agree on for the estimation for number three	We agreed on that the answer was closer to zero	sd	2
If I have 910 and 810 is 910 more than 12 or less than 12	More	aa	4
So if I had 810 is that more than 12 or less than 12	More	aa	4
More	Less than 12	sd	2
So if I have 12 and 12 how do I get zero	We thought that this 910 was close to 1 and then 810 was a little close to 1 and then 11 is closer to 0	sd	5
Why are you disagreeing with that	Our group disagreed because some of us did 110 and then Tony had gotten 010 and then Becky got 210	sd	2
Dwayne	If you added them together	sd	4
What would your estimate be	About two	sd	4
If this is not a good fit Im not going to be a happy woman	Im saying that if you go through it and then you see	sd	1
Clay show them what you did with your drawing and show them why its different than what they did	I drew the circle and I split it into 13 and 9 and then its subtracting eight from nine	sd	5
I drew the circle and I split it into 13 and 9 and then its subtracting eight from nine	I crossed out nine of them	sd	5
Does one line work better than putting both of them	Yes	b	1
Dwayne would I add those together already or would I just do the problem one drawing at a time	Just at one time is better	sd	4
Wheres your 13	We have that common denominator	sd	4
We have that common denominator	So draw the circle	sd	2
Lisa what is the first thing that you notice about this problem	I notice	sd	1
What do you notice about the problems looking at it	4x3	b	4
What else do you notice	Then how you notice that theres 12  so those 34 then times	sd	4
Bruce what are you saying	The common denominator	sd	4
The common denominator	I did 26 and then 36	sd	4
What would be the next step	The next step would be	sd	1
I would like to see how you think you should solve it using your slates	Individually	sd	1
Now do what you said you were doing	First of all 912412	sd	4
Nessa whats 912412	Is it 512	sd	4
Is it 512	It s like 2 4 6 8 10	sd	2
Did you find your common denominator	Yes	b	1
Dont solve the problem I just want to see the gaps	Im just going to go ahead and make a big one so I dont mix up my problems	sd	1
Show it so that everyone can see it	Okay so I did 3 13 and I knew that 2x3 is 6 so I did 1x2 which equals 2 and then I did  then I put these 3 right here and then I knew about 1 12  3x26	sd	5
Okay so what fractions are you now subtracting	1 56	b	4
Can I just subtract that	No	b	1
I cant	We can	sd	4
We can	Yes we cant	sd	4
Were going to erase that and I want you to write it bigger over here	Because 5x3 will be 15	sd	5
So is one whole is going to give me a bigger number at the top than at my bottom	Yes	b	1
Right	Right	b	1
Now can you do it	Yes	b	1

Go	Isn t Laura supposed to coach us through five	sd	1
What times two equal six	Three	sd	4
Okay not I have three and twosixths minus one	Threesixths	sd	4
Why not	That number is	ba	1
That number is	Whats six minus two	sd	2
Where am I borrowing from	Three	sd	4
but how many did I borrow from that	A whole	sd	4
A whole sixsixths so what do I need to do now	Sissixths plus twosixths	sd	4
Now can I borrow	Yes	b	1
Whats my answer	Now its oneeighths	sd	4
No each table member should have gotten one	She got two	sd	2
Do you understand where your mistake was made	Yes	b	1
Im sorry if I shu	Its okay	sd	1
This is where your problem	we have 10 minus four and twothirds equal to four	sd	4
we have 10 minus four and twothirds equal to four	Because we minus	sd	5
Because we minus	That would be our answer	sd	4
Okay you have to do a whole step before you ever get to that point	No I add to the four	sd	4
How easy is that problem to solve	Thats what I get	sd	1
Can I take two from three	Borrow to the whole	sd	4
Borrow to the whole	Well whenever youre trying to	sd	1
How many did I borrow one whole of what How many wholes did I borrow	Nine plus seven equals 16 thats how they got nine and then you took a whole of	sd	5
Two and eightsixths whats eight minus three	Equals five	sd	4
My friends that I have not spoken with please look at problem number is it six that I wanted you to look at	No five	sd	1
No five	Number five I think	sd	1
Whatd you get	I got one and fivesix	sd	4
If I have 3 and 13 and Im going to turn my	Shes got six and 715 so help her	sd	2
If I borrow one whole from here how many do I borrow	onesixth	sd	4
Then once youve talked about that Have you guys done that	Yes	b	1
Yes	Were starting it right now	sd	1
Austin what did you get	I got I think thats	sv	1
All right continue explaining because you are incorrect	What did you do	aa	3

Doing it your way this is what you shouldve got	I got the	sd	1
What did you get	I got two	sd	4
What did you get	Four and onefourth what is that	sd	4
You got 12	We got two 10 and 12	sd	2
Listen to what shes saying Dwayne	isnt it a plus problem	sd	4
isnt it a plus problem	Addition problem	sd	4
Are we ready to listen	Its going to be 12	sd	4
Still waiting	Three six nine then 12	sd	4
Okay when you agreed on your answer did you doublecheck your work	Yes	b	1
Because I just had you guys talk because you were ready	said it was difficult to solve the problem because you have to convert because you cant do like	sd	5
What did you have to convert sweetie	The denominators	sd	4
What did you have to make them	Common denominators	sd	4
Then what did you have to do	Then we had to solve the problem	sd	4
Well you	exchange because we had to	sd	4
Franc expand on exchange	We didnt subtract I dont remember the numbers we didnt subtract them the top one from the bottom one so we had to	sd	4
The top one from the bottom one language	The top number from the	sd	4
Which is called	Well no I dont remember  the two fractions and then we had to go to the whole number and	sd	4
We couldnt subtract the fractions because the top numerator was	Small	sd	4
Then I had to exchange it for a	Whole	sd	4
My goal was that you were going to	I think she did 210  45100   and then she said she did 310  45100  47100	sd	5
I think she did 210  45100   and then she said she did 310  45100  47100	I did that because 210 and then theres	sd	5
I did that because 210 and then theres	I said that it was 20100 in gold because 210 is 15 of 100 so that means that 20100 is 15 of 100	sd	5
I said that it was 20100 in gold because 210 is 15 of 100 so that means that 20100 is 15 of 100	Because thats easier because everything else is hundredths	sd	5
Because thats easier because everything else is hundredths	say is that the denominators werent the same	sd	5
say is that the denominators werent the same	You have 210 and then you have 45100 so you have to make them the same denominator to be able to add	sd	5
You have 210 and then you have 45100 so you have to make them the same denominator to be able to add	You have to turn this into hundredths which	sd	5
You have to turn this into hundredths which	How do you know	qy	3
How do you know	The same denominator	sd	4
The same denominator	You can only add the numerator together if the denominator is the same	sd	5
You can only add the numerator together if the denominator is the same	Okay	b	1
Okay	210  510	b	4
210  510	Yes	b	1
Yes	You need to have the same denominator to be able to add a fraction and get an equivalent	sd	5
You need to have the same denominator to be able to add a fraction and get an equivalent	You would change 210 to 20100	sd	4
You would change 210 to 20100	10	b	4
10	Yes	b	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	Check your answer	sd	1
Check your answer	I got 1110	sd	4
I got 1110	1 and 110	sd	4
1 and 110	Yes	b	1
Yes	That the denominators arent the same	sd	4
That the denominators arent the same	Sure	b	1
Sure	I did it 3 x 10 because I know that 3 x 10 gives me 30	sd	5
I did it 3 x 10 because I know that 3 x 10 gives me 30	I did 3 x 10 and then I got 30 and then I added the other to 90100 and then I got 1 and 20100	sd	5

It takes the bottom at the beginning whats higher at the wait no wait	Youre going to have to divide 100 by 10	sd	4
Youre going to have to divide 100 by 10	Its 80 divided by 10	sd	4
Its 80 divided by 10	Yes	b	1
I might say Okay were going to do page What were we on 140	Yes	b	1
What do you think Pairs Compare might be	You get with your partner and then two people talk together and then you all four go together	sd	4
Does everybody know their number at their table group	Yes	b	1
Do you know your team numbers	Yes	b	1
What did your team talk about for onehalf of nine	We got four and a half because we drew like  we all drew a rectangle and then we split it into two and we were able to split them all so they had four	sd	5
Talk to us about what youre doing	Im splitting them and Im counting up to nine and then I got to eight but then this one would have  one left over	sd	5
Friends stand up if you are number four at your team	Im standing	sd	1
Are you ready	Yes	b	1
Go	Onefourth of five	sd	5
Whats it asking while Collins Corey	Whats five divided by four	sd	4
Does anybody have another way to think about it	five and the denominator is four	sd	4
Can you tell us what youre doing and why	Im just writing it up into a square and then I put the number thats four	sd	5
I just wanted you to tell us what youre doing	Im just drawing a square and putting the numbers there  four ones and then onefourth	sd	5
Im just drawing a square and putting the numbers there  four ones and then onefourth	One and onefourth	sd	5
Left over	No therell be one more whole left over	sd	5
No therell be one more whole left over	Since theres four wholes already there is going to be onefourth because four  is a whole	sd	5
Since theres four wholes already there is going to be onefourth because four  is a whole	There ll be one and onefourth	sd	5
Comment awesome	I agree with your answer but I did it differently on how to figure it out	sd	2
You want to tell us	Yes	b	1
Yes	I took the five and put it over  and then I  how many times four goes into five	sd	5
I took the five and put it over  and then I  how many times four goes into five	One and then there is onefourth added on to it	sd	5
Go	I can form ordered pairs plot them and interpret coordinate values in context	sd	1
My friends youre getting so good at plotting coordinate points right	Yes	b	1
Casey read it for us	Look at the data in the table below	sd	1
Look at the data in the table below	Miss  told her class to use the data to write ordered pairs	sd	1
Miss  told her class to use the data to write ordered pairs	Ingrid wrote the following ordered pairs	sd	1
You have your whiteboards	Yes	b	1
Why are you on the no side	Because it says five ones then three and seven and on the graph it shows 7 3	sd	5
Why did that make you come over here	Because it does not match the data	sd	5
Because it does not match the data	It doesnt match	sd	5
Welcome	Hello	sd	1
Your job right now is to explain to each other do Ingrids ordered pairs model the data	No	b	1
The person you just talked to would you please thank them for being your partner	Thank you	aa	1
Were really good at getting our ordered pairs on the graph but is it important what order you put them in	Yes	b	1
My friends this means when Lilith is how old	Five years old	sd	4
When Lilith is	Seven	sd	4
Her brother Damien is	Three	sd	4
When Lilith is	Eleven	sd	4
Her brother is	Seven	sd	4
When Lilith is	Twelve	sd	4
Twelve	Eight	sd	4
Your first ordered pair is called the	Xaxis	aa	4
The second ordered pair we call it the	Yaxis	sd	4
Have you learned this	Yes	b	1
My friends do you have this data in your graph on your page right now	Yes	b	1
Whats the difference	Four years	aa	4
When Lilith is seven Damien is	Three	sd	4
Whats the difference	Four years	aa	4
How olds your brother now	Hes 14	sd	4
How old are you		b	4
Are you always the same number of years apart	Yes	b	1
Are you ready to think	Yes	b	1
Say it	Interpolate	sd	1
How do we do that	One way that we can do it is to count up from eight  or count down	sd	4
Because the pattern is Lilith is always	Four years older	sd	4
Say it extrapolate	Extrapolate	sd	1
Are you working with a partner or by yourself	By ourselves	sd	4
Do you have four five and six done	Yes	b	1
I dont know next week or the week after	Yes	b	1
Thank you for having me	Thank you	aa	1
What would you do	Id	sd	1
Tell us how it is whats the right answer	Equals two	sd	4
So Elliot how did you know this answer was two	Well one Im ever on that  two if you didnt know it you subtract four	sd	4
How do you know I wasnt looking for a smiley face	Its a mathematics problem	sd	4
Aaron what do you think	Because if you add two plus four you would get six	sv	5
Whats it be called that when you had to write the equation with the Emmerson	The unknown	sd	4
I know its early but we got to wake up here	Yes	b	1
Very likely	No	b	1
Ailani whats my unknown	Your unknown is the number that you have to subtract	sd	4
Aisha you cant figure out that unknown	No	b	1
The information that someone speaks gets processed in your brain and then your response comes out of your	Mouth	sd	4
Now what number does the robot want to spit out of its mouth		b	4
Alexia what two operations can we use to make a number get bigger	A bigger number	sd	4
What two operations can we use to make a number get bigger	Multiplication and addition	sd	4
Well unfortunately we dont yet because can we use both addition and subtraction to make a six into a 12	Yeah	b	1
What number do we want to get out	10 12	b	4
Can we multiply by two	No	b	1
No because whats four times two	Eight	sd	4
So that leaves us with what	Adding six	sd	4
If were going to add six if I add six and four what do I get		b	4
If I add six and six what do I get		b	4
What is our operation going to be	Plus six	sd	4
Oh I dont like using the word plus	Add six	sd	4
Whats going to come out of its mouth	Eight	sd	4
Emmerson		b	4
In this row right here	Whats coming out of the mouth	sd	4
So if weve been adding whats the opposite of adding	Subtraction	aa	4
So simply subtract six from nine and what do we get	Three	sd	4
If we put three into the ear and we add six will it give us nine	Yes	b	1
How many clues do we have Adeline	Three	sd	4
And we have those two rows right there that are completed correct	Yes	b	1
So are the numbers going in the ear coming out of the mouth getting larger or getting smaller	Large	sd	4
Large	Smaller	sd	2
Anson are they getting larger or smaller	Smaller	sd	4
Emmerson which two operations do we have to use	Subtraction and division	sd	4
The answer Im looking for has to do with the numbers that are in that clue	smaller than the other one	sd	4
Elliot what do you think that reason might be	Thatd be easier to divide	sd	4
What number are we dealing with	Fives	sd	4
What number would I have to subtract from 20 to equal five Aldo		b	4
Oh this is why I said we have them memorize our facts Aaron	Five times four	sd	4
So if we divide 20 by four itll give us five correct	Yes	b	1
If I put 12 into the ear and I subtract 15 am I going to get three	You going to get a negative three	sd	4
Four times what equals 12 Aldo	Four times three equals 12	sd	4
Does it work	Yep	b	1
Ember whats my rule	Divide by four	sd	4
Well lets try to do them anyway shall we	Yep	b	1
Alvin	Four times seven	sd	4
So 28 divided by four is	Seven	sd	4
Mr Ember where would you start my friend	Draw a robot	sd	4
Mr Ember once you have that robot drawn out what are you going to do	Put the number in the ear and figure out a rule	sd	4
So why dont you walk me through Mr Ember what you would do to do so	look at the clue	sd	4
So Ember says were going to look at the clue which clue do you want to use Ember	Three and 15	sd	4
So what am I going to do with that clue Mr Ember	Youre going to see how much it takes youre going to add  to see where it gets to 15	sd	4
So what number is going into the ear of the robot	Three	sd	4
I think addition is a great place to start but why did you choose it	Itd be Emmerson to come up to give you 15	sd	4
But how did you know we arent subtracting here	Because the numbers getting bigger	sd	5
So Embers thinking were going to add what does he have to do next Ace	He has to find the number for the rule	sd	2
What other number do we already know in the robot	Eight	aa	4
What other number do we already know and where does that belong	In his mouth	sd	4
And if we are going to add Miss Ansona what will we have to add in order to get 15 out of the mouth		b	4
What is our other option here Van	We can multiply it by three	sd	4
So Amaya how are we going to determine which one of those is correct	Were going to use whatever	sd	4
We going to have to do what	We going to see if either of those	sd	4
So where do we have to go to figure out which one is correct	The next clue	sd	4
Aliza what do you think	I think what can help us is eight and 40 because you cant Well you can add something to eight to get 40 but its going to take a long time	sd	5
Why do you think we have to have two clues	I think we have to have two clues because  you will have to go to the second clue	sd	5
Can you try to explain it	So then you can use division and subtraction	sd	4
Is that going to work	Yeah	b	1
Alexia	Eight times 5 equals 40	sd	5
What about the other one	equals 40	sd	4
So if you didnt hear what Alexia just said Alexia just said that eight times five equals 40 but eight plus 12 only equals		b	4
	So if you do addition its	sd	4
If you do addition then	Its times 12	sd	4
Does it work	No it doesnt work	sd	4
Because what do I have to get out of the mouth	You need to get 40	sd	4
But what did I get out of the mouth		b	4
	Which is 20 less	aa	4
So now that we know what is our rule Ailani what is our rule going to be	12 plus 12	sd	4
What is that rule going to be Emmerson	Times five	sd	4
Can we use fourth grade terminology	Multiply by five	sd	4
Aaron what comes out		b	4
So Elliot what are we going to have to do to figure this out	We going to have to divide 20 by five	sd	4
Are you guys starting to understand why I say how important it is for you to understand your multiplication facts	Yes	b	1
This is a little bit of a test run and it is super crooked right now isnt it	Its very crooked	sd	1
Is that a little better	Thats a lot better	sv	1
Roy	I had trouble working on my answers because it says number of people Ryderples and then number of children I guess	sd	3
I had trouble working on my answers because it says number of people Ryderples and then number of children I guess	Both of the graphs say number of children so I didnt know how to do these	sd	3
Margie	It wasnt that hard but it took me a little while on number three like the total hours worked	sd	1
It wasnt that hard but it took me a little while on number three like the total hours worked	The total hours worked it wasnt that hard it was just	sd	1
It should even out at six right	Yes	b	1
Royal	I have a problem with doing it figuring out the number of people Ryderples mean and then multiply them together	sd	3
16	Its 16	sd	1
For this one	Its 10	sd	4
Well look where your line is	I thought it was supposed to be borrowed as over like you showed them and	sd	1
Margie you were saying thats what took a while right	Yes	b	1
All right lets see what 12 times 16 is	Its 192	sd	4

Theres four fours and an eight	There are three fours	sd	4
There are three fours	There are three fours	sd	4
Ryder who do you think	Bob because he is so much better at surfing than Ben and Ben is not very good at surfing	sd	5
Bob because he is so much better at surfing than Ben and Ben is not very good at surfing	Bob has a much better mode than he does and	sd	5
What is the mode for Bob	One and four	sd	4
Roy what do you think	I think Bob is better because again he has a mode thats four and then he also has an eight surfing time thats pretty good	sd	5
Whats the range for Bob	Seven	sd	4
Now what do you think	I think Ben is better because even though he got less that means he takes his time more	sd	5
Does everybody agree thats the same list as what we have over here	Yes	b	2
Yes	Are we going to draw the box over there	sd	1
Are we going to draw the box over there	Were going to draw the boxes in a moment but before we draw the boxes I want to talk about median because today I really want to focus on the difference between median and mean	sd	1
Do I need to draw any of these bars to find median	No	b	1
Is it in between two and two	Yes	b	1
Everybody agree its right there	Yes	b	2
Did anybody think it was going to be 25	No	b	1
I know some of you already did that	Can we start finding the mean	sd	1
Is this skewed at all	No	b	4
I just want to say that you cant talk about skewed from that but you can talk about skewed or symmetric from this	Thats one thing we can put down on our note catcher	sd	1
Did everybody remember to move it to zero	Yes	b	1
You could draw the mean line in and its got two	So the mean is the same as the median	sd	4
What was the mode for Bens times	Oh its the mode	sd	1
Mode	Three	sd	4
Are these different than the mode	Yes	b	1
For mean I want you to move these to the small ones and see how youre going to go about it	Oh	b	1
Draw an arrow switch them and then youll use because were going to use that third one for Bobs friend Seth	I got the median	sd	1
Yes Salem	Do we have to do Seth	sd	1
Just looking at median does that tell us that Bob is a better surfer than Ben	Yes	b	1
Eric you good back there	Yes	b	1
Where is the mean line at	Three	sd	4
Are these the same	No	b	1
Looking at these numbers can we pretty much conclude that Bob is a better surfer than Ben	Yes	b	1
Mariana	Make a list of the numbers up above	sd	4
Over here	Of the data	sd	4
Three three three and one more three and three fours	Make a line pop	sd	4
Margie you already told us the range for this one	Oh ah ooh	b	1
What was the range for Bobs	Seven	sd	4
Whats the range for Seths	Three	sd	4
Sean what does that mean	Youre consistent	sd	4
Median how can we find median	Four	sd	4
And in the list up here its in between these two fours	Just four	sd	4
Is this median the highest of all of them	Yes	b	1
Maggie you all good	Yes Im just trying to	sd	1
What I noticed here yes Shannon	Well Ive got the answers	sd	1
For mean	Yes	b	1
What I noticed here is does Seth have way more boxes than these people	Yes	b	1
Shannon what did you say for mean	I said its four	sd	4
Is that the highest mean out of everyone	Yes	b	1
I would say that Seth is probably the best surfer out of all four of them	Yes Seth is pretty good	sd	1
Now what if we just based whos the best surfer based on who has the best the longest time	Then Bob would be	sd	4
Bob has the maximum he has the biggest surf time out of everyone	Ive had a 12 minute whiteboard time	sd	1
12 minute	Yes like behind a boat	sd	1
Thats a little different than surfing though because you dont get to	Because you dont have to go you dont have to stand all the way	sd	1
Can you fill it out though	Why does it stay on you	sd	1
Because I have this thing	Well why does it have to stay on you	sd	1
Well because Im moving around	Im just going to unduck and then Ill just look at him	sd	1
Silas	I think Seth because he has the biggest mean and median	sd	5
Salem	I think that Seth is better because his mean and median were real high than the others	sd	5
Salem can you say it again	I think that Seth is better because his mean and his median were real high than the others	sd	5
Marilyn	I think Seths better because his range is the smallest so his times are very consistent	sd	5
Okay Mariana last one	I think that it is Seth because he has the highest mean and median but it could also be Bob because he has the highest score or the highest time	sd	5
Raise your hand Im going to give you two choices teams or individual	Teams	sd	1

Code is up here	I cant see it	sd	1
Whos LOL Me	Me	b	1
Salem youre going to be with Sky	Okay	b	1
All right people were going to start and were going to go to the questions	on our team	sd	1
Can you find the exact range	We dont know	sd	1
All right people youve got about 15 seconds before you can put in your answer	We already did	sd	1
I may have you do a few of them because therere two different types	Is that a	sd	1
Everybody got their	everybody	sd	1
You are rounding it to the nearest tenths not a whole tenth	Or you take after our first eight number of  or just like	sd	4
Tenths hundredths	Then its	sd	1
Because thats in what place value	Thousandths	sd	4
Shawn how did you round this my friends	I did	sd	1
I did	I knew that three is less than five	sd	5
I knew that three is less than five	so I just subtracted as five and itll be 025	sd	5
so I just subtracted as five and itll be 025	because its	sd	1
005	Yes because seventh	sd	5
It cant be zero point	Yes its	sd	1
Archiel what mathematical process would you use	Well  four people and thy pay 84 so I  will be 42 plus 42 plus 42 is 84	sd	5
Okay	Well what I got was 2102 because I did four goes into eight twice so I	sd	5
Youre not using mathematical vocabulary	Well because 4x28	sd	5
Im not multiplying anything there	Its probably by division way	sd	4
Thank you	I put a two  here and I did 4x28 and I did 880	sd	5
I put a two  here and I did 4x28 and I did 880	Then I said four goes into four once so I put a one above the four and I did 1x44 and zero	sd	5
Then I said four goes into four once so I put a one above the four and I did 1x44 and zero	Then I got four goes into one zero so I put up there	sd	5
Then I got four goes into one zero so I put up there	I brought the two down so I didnt have to add more to  over there	sd	5
Im not seeing anything after you came up with zero	Right here because four cant go into	sd	5
Do you see what Im saying	Yes	b	1
and Im going to have Stacy show you hers	out of 8412	sd	5
out of 8412	Then first I did  the 20 four times or is it yes 3 four times will be 80 like 8000 if you did 2000x4	sd	5
Then first I did  the 20 four times or is it yes 3 four times will be 80 like 8000 if you did 2000x4	I got the  80 and then I subtracted and	sd	5
I got the  80 and then I subtracted and	I got 412	sd	5
I got 412	Then I did 1 and	sd	5
Then I did 1 and	so it was 4 how much dollars are left	sd	5
so it was 4 how much dollars are left	I counted 4	sd	5
I counted 4	4 times 3 is 12 so 1212 is 0	sd	5
4 times 3 is 12 so 1212 is 0	Then I  that together	sd	5
Then I  that together	and I got 2106	sd	5
and I got 2106	Okay	b	1
Do you understand why Im saying your division was not complete	Yes	b	1
Please tell me	Maybe I can write  when I get a strategy for it	sd	1
Okay does that make sense	Yes	b	1
What do you think Stacy	Maybe a hundred 4 or 80 4	aa	5
Now if you wouldve done that how much did you have left		b	4
If theres four kids how much did they each pay up this for	30 cents	sd	4
wheres your decimal going to go after	Bless you	sd	1
Archiel let me see yours	Wait so wait	sd	1
Wait so wait	See is this is why I worried about the decimal	sd	4
Let me see what you did	Ive erased because of the decimal with	sd	4
Its got nothing to do with the decimal because the decimal should be able to go right back in	I did	sd	1
3 times	200 because 600	sd	5
Because 600	Thats correct	ba	4
Great so 600 and then 8 is		b	4
246	Yes	b	1
and then you did 50	Even thats why it goes on 50	sd	5
Even thats why it goes on 50	no one who could fix here minus	sd	5
If I lined all those up	No like you	sd	1
No like you		b	4
If I was dealing with 846 cents where would my decimal go Archiel	everything	sd	1
Oh you said the eight down here	I dont know	sd	1
If I do No this would be 282	Also	sd	1
I got to do this differently	Sorry	b	1
Go get me a piece of	Excuse me	sd	1
Im not the way I cant split change into that		b	4
846 3	The next one is 4	sd	4
1 0 96 and 66 and	With this	ba	1
With this	Thats it	ba	1
Archiel come here for just a second	Thanks welcome	sd	1
Whats less than 100		b	4
		b	4
145 is	This is too	sd	1
3 times what is going to get me closest to 90	is six	aa	4
3x6 is	Is nine	sd	4
I want to get close to 96	16 times	sd	4
You just got me into the hundreds	Oh is it like 30 times	sd	4
Times	three	sd	4
30x3 because what is that going to equal Jyle		b	4
What about Jyle		b	4
You add remainder five you would change that to three because were rounding okay	Oh	aa	1
Im not sure then what youre doing talking to Addison	Do it the same way I did it with	sd	1
I need to see where youre at right now	Well I just erased all I had because	sd	1
of	Grid paper	sd	1
But I want you to think in your head what are we going to be doing today	Adding and subtracting fractions	sd	4
Talk to your neighbor	Add and subtract fractions and	sd	4
Add and subtract fractions and	Of a fraction that people have done	sd	4
What tool	A number line	sd	4
Any other any other things that youve heard or said that you would like to share	Splitting numbers into either or turning numbers into either improper fractions or mixed numbers	sd	4
So sometimes that can help you	Fraction circles	sd	4
We use fraction circles	Number line	sd	4
Number line	Division	b	4
Aiden	Because I know that the eight is worth 800 and the 9 is worth 90 and the zeros worth 0 and the seven is 7000	sd	5
How do you know the 7 is 7000	The 7 is in the thousands place	sd	4
Tyler	32 million 800 thousand	sd	4
32 million 800 thousand	Its a big number	sd	1
32 million	32 million 800 thousand	sd	4
Eight hundred	Eight hundred	sd	1
Ninetyfive	Ninetyfive million	sd	4
Thats in the what place	Thousands	sd	4
Thousands	Thousand four hundred seventytwo	sd	4
Just the number you wrote down	20 million	sd	4
Anna	929 million 867 thousand 135	sd	4
How much flour do they need in all	Where are we supposed to write it	sd	1
Okay and did you estimate that	No	b	1
Okay or how many thirds is that	Three	sd	4
Three	Four thirds	sd	4
Anna	So two thirds plus two thirds is four thirds	sd	5
So two thirds plus two thirds is four thirds	So if these are the same then you can add them easily	sd	5
So if these are the same then you can add them easily	And you could just add the top and thats four	sd	5
Okay can you show us on here	So it would be right about	sd	1
And then if we added another two thirds what would you do with that	You would add that and that would be four thirds but the next number is one and a third	sd	5
So if you used	Right here	aa	1
Bricker	The good thing about using a number line is that  where your fractions are	sd	4
The good thing about using a number line is that  where your fractions are	So it shows between zero and one and two	sd	2
So it shows between zero and one and two	You can tell that because it says between zero and one so you can tell where the fractions are	sd	5
I really like that answer	Also it helps prove your answer cause it shows how you can get your answer with fractions	sd	5
Aiden	I think the benefits of a number line is is you have like all the numbers like lets say youre getting 15 to plus two fifths and you can see a 15 is here and add two fifths by walking three fourths and a four	sd	5
Go	So three fourths and two fourths would be around four and a half	sd	5
Times up	One fourth	sd	4
One fourth	And I got	sd	1
And I got	Two fourths would be around four and a half	sd	2
Two fourths would be around four and a half	I got four and 14	sd	2
Anna	My estimate was two plus two and a half	sd	4
Two plus two and a half equal	Four and a half	sd	4
Anna call on somebody	My number model was one and three fourths plus two and two fourths equals four and one fourth	sd	5
George	So what I did was I added one plus 2 and then I added 3 fourths plus 2 fourths and I got 5 fourths	sd	5
So what I did was I added one plus 2 and then I added 3 fourths plus 2 fourths and I got 5 fourths	And I got a whole with a remainder of one fourth so four and one fourth	sd	5
What would an estimate be for this one	Three	sd	4
So what did you start with	Three as a whole number	sd	4
What is this closest to	Zero	sd	4
Addition subtraction multiplication division	Subtraction	aa	4
So is it close to one one and a half or two	One and a half	sd	4
Ashley	One half	sd	4
Aiden	Two and one sixth minus one and four sixths	sd	4
Anna	I couldnt do one minus four	sd	4
You couldnt take four sixths away from one sixth right	Yeah so I converted	sd	4
Can I show your work	Okay	b	1
Joey	So I know that there are two  theres two remaining	sd	5
So I know that there are two  theres two remaining	And then theres one sixth left	sd	5
And then theres one sixth left	And then once you get rid of  one sixth plus two sixths is three sixths	sd	5
Bridger	So I kind of added mine but I separated the wholes from the fractions and I did two minus one equals one and then I did one six one minus 4 equals 3 and then we add it to the sixths so it equals one and three sixths	sd	5
Okay so Caleb would you mind explaining why do you think it is	I think its one and a half because I took two minus one and I got one	sd	5
Uhhuh	And then we have one more sixth left over	sd	5
And then we have one more sixth left over	Two and one sixth	sd	5
Two and one sixth	And then subtracted four sixths from one sixth and got three sixths	sd	5
So then what did you do with that	I changed a whole number into a fraction	sd	4
So you guys have some different strategies for proving	Now that I think of it three sixths basically a half	sd	4
Now that I think of it three sixths basically a half	So thats about the same	sd	4
Okay um for those of you who like algorithms you can take Tom did you have a question	So what if you subtracted it different	sd	3
So what if you subtracted it different	Like you did the fractions first then the actual number	sd	3
So do you want to show us how you did that	So what I did	sd	1
Lets see	So if you want to subtract four from one sixth you would have to get rid of this and make it a one	sd	5
So if you want to subtract four from one sixth you would have to get rid of this and make it a one	But then that would turn into 7	sd	5
But then that would turn into 7	And then if you did 4 minus 7 you would have	sd	5
And then if you did 4 minus 7 you would have	And that means youd have three sixths	sd	4
Would you agree with that	Yeah	b	2
Andrea	I think I have one more way to do it but its a different answer	sd	3
We have We have one unit one unit pan of brownies	What does that mean though	sd	3
That means	What is the dimensions of the large square	sd	3
We know the area of our large square is Is what	What are the units	sd	3
Its a way of	What does one by one mean	sd	3
Area	One square times one square	sd	1
Length times width equals area	Think of it kind of as like	sd	1
Two thirds times	Two thirds	sd	1
Hunter	Four ninths	sd	4
Now label the blank tick marks on the number line	So were doing the exact same	sd	4
Zachary	I think its by four	sv	4
Why by fourths	Because I counted it out and its four squared	sd	5
We have one fourth unit by	Three fourths	sd	4
Hadley	Three fourths	sd	4
So now we have to find the area of the shaded rectangle	We could just times	sd	4
How many squares do you see shaded in Skyler	Three	sd	4
How many squares are there in all	Eight	sd	4
One times three is three	Three	sd	1
Four times four is	Thats exactly how I do it	sd	1
Were learning it conceptually	I like that theres no shortcuts when it comes to math	sd	1
This three fourths told me where to stop	Hey Miss Koski I feel an answer that you might not have thought about	sd	1
Okay	However its a Im not going to spoil it right now	sd	1
Dont spoil it	See if you can find it	sd	1
Hadley	24	b	4
Youre feeling good you can work on your own on two and three and math boxes on your own	Sorry Miss Koski I dont have a billion	sd	1
Royce	Can you answer	sd	1
I hope you have time to do that this afternoon	Oh	b	1
Its going to be more than two seconds	20 seconds	sd	1
You can just tell me	24	b	2
I feel like I could teach the next problem	Theres also an easier way in the book	sd	1
You could teach college students	How about half a finger for a half	sd	1
Yeah	I think well if youre doing the next number as an improper fraction wouldnt you multiply the two by four to get eight	sv	5
I think well if youre doing the next number as an improper fraction wouldnt you multiply the two by four to get eight	Then you add the ones	sd	4
Then you add the ones	Thats right	aa	1
Thats right	Yeah then you add the ones to make the 90s or something	sd	4
Its just going to be 94	94	b	1
what should we do first	Find the common denominator	sd	4
Say that again	Eight	aa	4
To get from two to eight were going to multiply by four	I thought you were asking me for that	sd	1
what are we going to do next	Then you would multiply eight times three plus four	sd	5
288 divided by 58	Where did you get 288	sd	3
Lets do Royce	Is it okay if I say it	sd	1
Is it okay if I say it	We got it because you put the three into it and got three and 48 to a how do I say it	sd	5
We got it because you put the three into it and got three and 48 to a how do I say it	Improper fraction	sd	5
Improper fraction	Then we use the three to take it time eight and thats 24 plus four is 28	sd	5
I have three wholes there and if they each have eight pieces that would be 24 pieces the size of 18	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	I remember Royce in fifth grade	sd	1
I remember Royce in fifth grade	You go eight times three which is 24	sd	5
You go eight times three which is 24	Oh sorry	b	1
Yeah you were right	24 and then you do plus four	sd	4
whats our next step	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	The mute button was on mute	sd	1
The mute button was on mute	You divide 28 divided by five	sd	4
Can you help us write this as a mixed number	It would be five and 35	sd	4
do you agree Cassidy or have a question	I agree	aa	2
Well how do you know thats correct	Five goes into 28 five times and then theres 35 left over	sd	5
Were going to draw a couple of diagrams on the next one just to make sure we feel super solid on what this also represents	How did you get the denominator of five on there	sd	3
When I did 285 I said five goes into 28 five times and then theres three pieces that are the size of 15 left over	You make it into a fraction	sd	4
Yeah	Nevermind	sd	1
Yep right there	Even if we were  couldnt we just do five and 35 times the other number to get a  number	sd	4
What I want to tell you if you can tell me why that works when you come to school on Thursday I will let you use it but until you can totally explain not how it works but why it works Im going to ask you to use this common denominator strategy	Okay	b	1
Would you guys like to use a number line or a tape diagram	Number line	sd	1
Number line	Number line	sd	1
Remember we did geometry in August and September	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	I was just	sd	1
do you want to share your idea	16 would just be half of 13	sd	5
Okay keep going	Then you can also do the same 16 26 36 46	sd	5
13 is the same as 26 right	Yep	b	1
If we count these 16 will fit in one two three four times	Theres also a way but I dont know how to explain it at the moment	sd	3
Rylan what should I do first	Multiply 23 by two	sd	4
Multiply 23 by two	Yeah	b	1
What will that give me	46	b	4
Celeste what should I do next	You divide those two	sd	4
Okay and whats that going to give me when I divide	One and	sd	4
Four divided by five which equals we can just say 4 over five	Fifths	aa	4
Yeah	I thought of another number one because its like	sd	1
Yeah	Would that be the same for any number like that	sd	4
Would that be the same for any number like that	Whats just an example	sd	3
Whats just an example	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	78 and 56 would that be seven what was my other number	sd	3
Theyd have to have a common denominator so the example that you gave didnt have a common denominator	Okay well there was an example like I dont know 13 and 39	sd	4
Okay well there was an example like I dont know 13 and 39	Could that be able to I dont know	sd	3
If we did 13 divided by 23 your answer would be 12	But how	sd	3
That fraction bar is a division sign divided by two	The threes cancel out technically	sd	4
They just tell us Okay youre dealing with the same size piece here	I have a question	sd	3
Sure  whats up	Im a bit confused because I thought you said to do this on the problems that you said that they had to have this  because	sd	3
Okay let me shade in 23 here	This is a tape diagram	sd	4
Yeah this is a tape diagram	Okay	b	1
Thats where 45 comes from	Oh because theres a total of five pieces but theres four pieces out of the five	sd	5
I just put it there to show you what one whole looks like	But then why would you shade the five	sd	3
56 is the size of our piece that were dividing up into	Oh	b	1
Theres five and 12 and were going to split up into pieces that are the size of four so four is the size of one of our groups	What page is this on	sd	1
Brooks what do you think	I think its 12	sv	4
what do you think	I agree	aa	2
Any other thoughts	Agree	sd	2
Brennan what do you think	Im not completely sure yet but it might be one and 13	sd	4
Rylan what do you think	34	b	4
One and 34 or just 34	Just 34	sd	4
Yeah Royce	I was	sd	1
Briar	Can I share ideas or no	sd	1
Do you have a proposal for an answer	12	b	4
Briar well start with you	Okay I would support the one that I went with the one and 12	sd	4
Okay I would support the one that I went with the one and 12	Its not 12	sd	2
Its not 12	What	ba	1
What	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	What is he saying	sd	1
Go for it Samson	Theres that one there so it cant be any less than one	sd	5
Okay	Theres four out of five and then since that 12 well one and 12 is there and one and 12 plus one and 12 or one and 12 times two is actually four so that would have to be half of 34 so it would be one and 12	sd	5
Caelen what are you thinking	I think one and 12 too	sd	2
Uhhuh	See you started with a total of five and 12 and you can divide that by four but since you already have  You just have to circle the groups of four	sd	5
See you started with a total of five and 12 and you can divide that by four but since you already have  You just have to circle the groups of four	Since you circled the first group of four theres one and 12 remaining except if you divide five by four and stuff you cant and you get a fraction or a decimal	sd	5
Since you circled the first group of four theres one and 12 remaining except if you divide five by four and stuff you cant and you get a fraction or a decimal	You put that 12 left over from that	sd	5
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Sawyer what are you thinking	Actually can you	sd	1
Rylan what are you thinking	I think its 34 because if you have if two would be another 12 of four and then if you divide them all into fourths theres one two 34 of 12	sd	5
I see youre thinking like you have 34 here	Yeah	b	1
Right here do we all agree you have one whole set here one whole group here	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	2
We want to figure out what fraction of a group are left over from this	Im actually going to say one and 38	sd	4
Do you want so support your answer	Well because its less than 42 which means	sd	5
Okay cut these four in half	Then you would have eighths	sd	4
Okay	You have two	sd	4
Yeah Samson	The weird thing was I actually had that on my paper but for some reason I blanked	sd	1
Yeah	I have to leave in three minutes	sd	1
Can you get us started with this one	Yeah I love this strategy	sd	1
All right go for it my friend	All right	aa	1
All right	Three times three is nine	sd	5
Okay	Then that plus two is 113	sd	5
Then that plus two is 113	Yeah 113	b	4
Do you want to keep doing the next one Soren	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yeah	b	1
What would that be	Put that two and 13	sd	4
Okay and what would that be	Then you do 11 as	sd	4
Wait two and 13 how would we write that as an improper fraction	Two times three equals six	sd	5
Two times three equals six	Six plus one equals seven	sd	5
What would our final answer be	One and 47	sd	4
Samson do you agree Cassidy or have a question	I agree	aa	2
I have to go	Is there any homework I have to do	sd	1
Yep please finish this page that we had in your notes today or that we started this morning	Okay thank you	sd	1
Yeah Celeste	Were we not supposed to do problem number two	sd	1
Did you already do it	Yeah	b	1
What	I already did it	sd	1
Does that sound okay	Yeah	b	1
Brooks whats a common denominator between four and eight	Eight	sd	4
If we multiply the numerator and the denominator by two whats an equivalent fraction	Are you asking me	sd	1
Yeah	Oh	b	1
Oh	It would be 68	sd	4
Six what	Six cups	sd	4
Six divided by one	Or scoops excuse me	sd	4
What was the strategy you take	Im not going to spell it	sd	1
What is the strategy you like to use to divide a fraction by a fraction	I was going to describe the one where you did the common denominator and you did I forget what it was	sd	4
I was going to describe the one where you did the common denominator and you did I forget what it was	Im going to look at my notes	sd	1
Okay	someone else while I find it	sd	1
Colette S what did you write for work C	I was thinking basically the same thing as Brighton	sd	2
I was thinking basically the same thing as Brighton	Basically you find the least common multiple	sd	4
Yeah	After you  the multiple	sd	4
Does the board look exactly like whats on your sheet	Yes	b	1
I hope so because I copied it directly from the sheet	Do we write both things	sd	1
I give you one	Thank you	aa	1
I give me one I give you one	Thank you	aa	1
Me you	Thank you	aa	1
Me you	Thank you	aa	1
Hunter can you do me a favor and go close the door for me	Yeah	b	1
Dash in the number 63 what is my six worth	I would say its worth 60	sd	4
Hadleys first number is 43 Honour what is her four worth		b	4
Haven	Three	sd	4
Hunter	60 and two	sd	4

Uh huh its a nine and a six 96	90 and six	sd	4
What are her two tens places Aubriella	40 and 90	sd	4
Avah	40 and six	sd	4
Dash	That came from having numbers of 60  of Hadleys numbers between 43 and 96	sd	5
That came from having numbers of 60  of Hadleys numbers between 43 and 96	And like Hadleys numbers  between 63 and 62	sd	5
Huh	I was trying to say 40	sd	4
Were going to start with three times	90	b	4
Whats left to multiply Enzo	The ones	sd	4

Youre more than welcome to check mine if you want Im going to check yours just to make sure that you added everything correctly	Im pretty sure I didnt	sd	1
Avah	Because it was not neat and it was kind of small	sd	4
Maybe it did	Can you get the remote and unfreeze it	sd	1
Hadley nice job you get to pick who my next opponent is	Haven	sd	1
Who would have won that one myself or Hadley	Hadley	sd	4
Ill just erase all this we dont need the lines	Can you just erase the whole thing	sd	1
Switch it to pen	Looks like Im not too short	sd	1
Hadley did you give me your cards back	Yeah	b	1
How many cards do I get	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	Thank you	aa	1

Thank you	Thank you	aa	1
What do I do with my four cards	You write down the cards you have	sd	4
Does it matter what order theyre in	No	b	1
Well see if she plays right	Oh no	ba	1
Jaki tell us one double digit number she should use using all of her single digits		b	4
What should her second number be Dash		b	4
Ariana what do I do	Um	b	1
Honour whats my first team going to be	Your first team is 80 plus one	sd	4
Mr Harry what is my second team going to be	40 and seven	sd	4
If you reverse those you got it right	70 and four	sd	4
Ford what is Havens first team going to be	Its going to be 80 and five	sd	4
Beautiful and her second team Armani is going to be what	90 and nine	sd	4
Change that to a you have to jump over so change that to a	Four	sd	4
Avah what do I get	80 and 70	sd	4
Donna what will that be	70 no	aa	4
70 no	80 times four	sd	4
Did you follow me or Haven	Haven	sd	1

Everybody whether you did Havens or mine look at mine and tell me where I messed up because I messed up	Oh I see it	sd	1
Harry is seven plus two plus zero nine	Yes	b	1
Plus one		b	4
So what did I do wrong Avah	Your regrouping	aa	4
She cheated	No I didnt	sd	1
Yes you did	No	b	1
Thank you Haven good job	Thank you	aa	1
Is it on the very first page	No	b	1
The inside cover	There it is	sd	1
There it is	Its on the back cover	sd	1
Are there any questions about how this works	No	b	1
Awesome	Three 12ths	sd	4
Three 12th	Six 24ths	sd	4
Awesome	16 24ths	aa	4
Okay and lucky last	12 18ths	aa	4
Well I mean	Does that work	sd	1
Well this isnt how you would ever express that	Oh	b	1
One divided by seven you get the same number as if you divided this by this	But I cant just put down one seventh	sd	4
But I cant just put down one seventh	Im finding the equivalent right	sd	2
I already had a battle	Yeah	b	1
Are you guys checking each others	Yes	b	1
Isaac give me Justins best one	Oh I will probably say 14 12ths	sd	4
Two		b	4
Yes who has two 14ths	Yeah	b	1
What was your favorite	What was my	sd	1
What was your favorite Landon	Well its probably	sd	1
Hes not the maths Ms Gibson	Yeah	b	1
All right did you guys showdown yet	Yeah	b	1
Okay so take off if you agreed with all of your partners	My favorite was nine 24ths	sd	4
My favorite was nine 24ths	Nine 24ths	sd	4
Mia	Six 16ths	sd	4
Awesome		b	4
Awesome	24 64ths	aa	4
Okay so you have to sign in through your dashboard and then go to McGraw Hill	Oh okay	b	1
Once you go to Chromebook or once youre in your Factors are on page what		b	1
And the person doing multiples needs to find the first six multiples of the number eight	Im doing the first six multiples of eight	sd	1
Colins got a good start		b	4
	All right found it	aa	1
You have to understand what factors are and then you can find it	Now you have to find all three multiples of six	sd	4
Now you have to find all three multiples of six	No theres six	sd	4
No theres six	I already found the ones	sd	1
I already found the ones	I found eight and sixes	sd	2
You already did amazing		b	4
Are you doing factors or multiples	Im doing	sd	1
Are you factors or multiples	Im multiples	sd	4
Did you read what multiples are	Isnt it like factors of a number that	sd	4
Isnt it like factors of a number that	So its like multiplying one number by a different number	sd	4
So list the first six	It can be like both answers	sd	4
So eight times one is	Eight times what	sd	1
So youre doing the first six multiples of the number eight	Oh okay	b	1
So eight times one is	You have to read	sd	1
All right	So what is a multiple	sd	3
Joey	Its the number that you use to multiply to get to a number	sd	4
So a number that you multiply with another number to get a Whats that fancy word	Sum	sd	2
Sum	Product	sd	2
Logan	One factor of 36 is one times 36	sd	4
Okay so factors of 36 would be one and 36	Four and nine	sd	4
Four and nine	Six and six	sd	4
Six and six	Six times six	sd	2
Any others	I have two and 18	sd	4
Uhhuh	And I have three and 12	sd	4
Did we get them all	Yup	aa	1
So does that seem kind of random like a random order	Yeah	b	1
Are you with me Brody	Yup	aa	1
One times what		b	4
Does two go into 36	Yes	b	1
Does three go into 36	Yes	b	1
Yes it does		b	4
Three times 12		b	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
Does five go into 36	No	b	1
Does six go into 36	Yes	b	1
Cooper	It is another product of another number sort of	sd	4
The first six multiples of eight are what Anna	The first six multiples of eight are eight 16 24 32 40 and 48	sd	5
So give me one factor pair of 36 Cooper	Six and six	sd	4
Landon	So we can add numbers	sd	4
And why do they have to have a common denominator	So they can be added easily	sd	4
So they can be added easily	Because say if its like one eighth plus one third you have to find a common denominator	sd	5
Because	you can add them	sd	4
you can add them	If you just add one third onto one eighth you dont really get an answer	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Like I dont know		b	1
		b	1
So these are factors		b	4
So what are we going to multiply it by	Eight	sd	4
So what are we going to do to three eights Isaac	Were going to put it to one eight	sd	4
What	Were going to put it to one eight	sd	4
I cant hear you	Were going to put it to one eight	sd	4
Joey	the denominator times three by times eight	sd	4
And the quick common denominator those are the three strategies that youre going to list here on your page	Ms  can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Once you have listed those strategies you can continue with the problems that are on pages 156 and 157	Can we work with partners	sd	1
How do you know that three over two is more than one whole	Did you call me	sd	1
London if I were to draw a picture would that help me	Sure	b	1
How many pieces	Three	sd	4
Three	I mean two	sd	4
So if I have a pizza this fraction shows me that my pizza is cut into two pieces but how many pieces out of the two do I have colored it	Three	sd	4
So London do I have enough in this one whole to color in three	No	b	1
So if I asked what is my whole in three halves how many pieces would make a whole if I have two in all	Hmm	sd	1
Is this a whole piece colored in	Yeah	b	1
Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number	Sorry did you call on me	sd	1
I said Jose	Sorry it must have been my mom or something	sd	1
Jose you here	Yes	b	1
Okay Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number	Oh I already forgot how	sd	1
Oh I already forgot how	that last week	sd	1
How are you	Wheres my notebook	sd	1
Kumar give me an example of a mixed number	What did you say	sd	1
Give me an example of a mixed number	I cant find it	sd	1
Kumar do you have your notes from last week	Yes	b	1
Give me one of them	Wait just a second	sd	1
Wait just a second	Okay	b	1
Okay	I cant find my notes	sd	1
I cant find my notes	I dont know where they are	sd	1
Guys we even talked about important it was to hold onto those notes and those definitions because we will be talking about them	Wait I think I remember	sd	1
All right Jose	Do I just choose a random one	sd	1
Yeah	Okay	b	1
Okay	Two fourths and the two in the side	sd	4
So two and two fourths	Yes	b	1
What does it have Elliot	It has a whole A big two that represents the wholes	sd	4
And it has what	It has the fraction that	sd	4
It has the fraction that	The four represents the pieces	sd	5
The four represents the pieces	So you know where that whole is coming from	sd	5
A whole being W H O L E	Youll have two wholes	sd	4
Two holes	And then	sd	1
And then	Draw And then put Maybe go back to the notes that we had	sd	1
Draw And then put Maybe go back to the notes that we had	Okay	b	1
Okay	The notes	sd	1
The notes	So what we did was that we colored in both of those	sd	4
So what we did was that we colored in both of those	And then at the other one we colored in two fourths	sd	4
Gabby what did you write down for the first one	I got 19	sd	4
Jenn explain why that will not work	I didnt really understand this	sd	3
Matty	13 x 19 is 127	sd	5
13 x 19 is 127	Right	b	1
Yes	127 and  out 13 is bigger than 127	sd	5
A whole number	Because  fraction is just getting smaller and smaller	sd	5
Gabby did you hear that	No	b	1
Explain that again	You use a fraction and it gets smaller and smaller	sd	5
Matty wont her 19 work here	Yes it would because it would be 5 and 72	sd	2
570 seconds	Yes	b	1
58 is	Bigger	sd	4
Okay Ms  What do you think buddy	For the first one I did 11 because 3 x 1  3 and 4 x 1  4 so	sd	5
Franc what did you do for the second one	For the second one I did 9 x	sd	4
Does that work people	No	b	2
Ricardo tell me why not	It doesnt work because its a smaller fraction than nine	sd	2
It doesnt work because its a smaller fraction than nine	Yes its a smaller fraction than 910	sd	2
Well 910 and 910 are equal to one another	Its equal to	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Clay what did you guys talk about	Well I said it was well that 24  1  24 and that I know  number after the decimal it would be greater	sd	5
Whats 44 Vicki		b	4
How funny you raised your hand I called your name without even looking	For me and  to make it easier to multiply  I mean the one  and you would do 62  12 and 13  3 but 3 can only go into 12 4 times	sd	5
For me and  to make it easier to multiply  I mean the one  and you would do 62  12 and 13  3 but 3 can only go into 12 4 times	Itll be less than	sd	5
Roberto what do you think	I think that it would be greater than 24	sv	4
Think about what we talked about up above Roge	It would be less than because you cant multiply a small	sd	5
I dont have a whole group of two do I	No you dont	ba	1
Miss Jenn if the second factor is less than one what do we know about the product	What does it mean when the second factor	sd	4
What do I know	I know that if the first one is a whole number its going to be less than	sd	5
If the second factor is greater than one what do we know about the product Martin	It will be greater than	sd	4
Martin will I have more than one group of the whole or less than the whole group	More than the whole group	sd	4
Martin	It will be less than because its	sd	4
If the first factor is greater than one everybody what do we know about the product	Its going to be greater than	sd	4

Yes what was your estimate	10200	b	4
Which equals		b	4
Matty tell me what you guys did for 8961 times 27	We did 9003 and we got 27 Wait 270 Or	sd	5
Kurt tell me what you did for 41  07	We did 1  41  41 because we rounded	sd	5
Why wouldnt you have just done 41	Thats what I did say	sd	1
Your estimate was 41 correct	Yes	b	1
Margo tell me what you did for 09  03	We did 101	sd	4
09 is closer to 10	I mean one	sd	4

What do you notice about the factors in these problems and what do you notice about the products in these problems	Its a first factor and then what I really noticed the first problem is theyre in their hundreds the first factor is in the hundreds	sd	4
Go	I did 11  28 then first	sd	4
Because you just told me you did 11x28 thats not estimating thats actually doing the problem	No I knew that 11x28 will make it 308	sd	5
Go ahead talk to me	Our answer was 11x28 and our estimate was 10x330 and 30 was close to 308	sd	5
Janessa did you notice anything	The first factor the first one was in the hundredths place and then all the way down	sd	4
The first factor the first one was in the hundredths place and then all the way down	The second one the second factor or the second one was less than one so itd be in the last place and then the last one the third factor The second factor was in the tenths already	sd	4
What	That they all have 28	sd	4
Alexander	It goes biggest medium and then small	sd	4
What of the decimal places are they all in the same place	No	b	1
No	Not even close	sd	4
Are they going to be the same numbers	No	b	1
Why did you place your decimal over here	It could be 5x1	sd	4
Are you rounding the numbers	I think it should be 1000	sv	4
36 is that closer to 30 or 40	I can divide it by 20	sd	4

Maxine	075	b	4
Miriam	Negative one and fivefifths or 2	sd	4
Tate	25	b	4
Imagine you owe someone 45 of 1 and then you make 1 15	That makes no sense though because it was three negatives	sd	5
That makes no sense though because it was three negatives	Because if you subtract negative from a negative youre supposed to add them	sd	5
Tate	My strategy for it is for both sides put both negatives together and put plus to it	sd	4
Over here negative times negative whats my answer going to be	Positive	sd	4
What do you think	I got 110	sd	4
Positive or negative	Positive	sd	4

Did I have to count back	No	b	1
Did I have to count boxes	No	b	1
David what was one of your strategies	I just counted by fives and then took the five from the seven and seven plus five made twelve	sd	5
Okay	So how I did it was I just made a big square and I divided it and made some boxes and counted them	sd	5
So how I did it was I just made a big square and I divided it and made some boxes and counted them	And then what I realized was all of them were equal	sd	5
And then what I realized was all of them were equal	They were all seven	sd	5
They were all seven	So seven plus seven	sd	5
Ella what was your strategy	My strategy was that I counted five times seven	sd	4

Yeah	No no no	aa	1
Kevin what was your strategy for this one	I made squares	sd	4
Owen what was your strategy	I counted by twos	sd	4
Why did you count by twos	Because it was a good number so I counted by twos	sd	5
So because we have 10 versus two so we could count by twos all the way through 10 right	Beautiful	sd	1
Mila what did you do	Count by tens	sd	4
Why did you choose to count by 10	Because it was a lot easier	sd	5
Is there a right way or wrong way	No	b	1
What answer did you get		b	4
If we counted by 10s we have two groups of 10	Which one is easier	sd	3
Which one is easier	But either way you got the same answer	sd	4
It might be easier it might be faster but either way you got the same answer right	Yeah	b	1
One more	Yes	b	1
No dont do that	What is she doing	sd	1
Four by six	Okay thats kind of easy	sd	1
Julia what did you do	I did four groups of six and I did six groups of two	sd	5
I did four groups of six and I did six groups of two	Two more groups of that is 24	sd	5
Any other strategies happen	I used the same one	sd	2
David	I made the blocks first because I didnt know what to do	sd	5
I made the blocks first because I didnt know what to do	And then I used my imagination to multiply the numbers	sd	5
Ella what did you do	I counted by fours	sd	4
And I saw you you were writing things down werent you	Yeah	b	1
You said And then you did five six seven eight	And then I did 12 then 16 then 20 then 24	sd	5
Six groups of four is		b	4
Carrie whats my area		b	4
So my area is 40	We did seven and it was 35 and then one more five and it would be 40	sd	5
How are we feeling	Good	ba	1
Questions	No	b	1
I threw you off times	Over here	sd	1
Over here	I can figure it out	sd	3
I can figure it out	The 23 and 49  you triple the 3 to get 9 then you have to triple the two to get 6 so 69 and	sd	5

Get your whiteboards out and dry erase markers for me please	No its not like	sd	1
Yes sir	Ill even show you	sd	1
Were down to 20	Yes thanks for telling me that theyre not	sv	1
Okay pick someone Frankie to explain why	I wanted to  because when youre multiplying something youre breaking it up in smaller parts and stuff	sd	5
Is that what you said	No no	ba	1
No no	He said three fourths	sd	2
Its less than okay	Oh it was	sd	1
If you believe you can now explain why he is incorrect Marco go ahead	Because  you would have to put the denominator two  to multiply	sd	5
I would put my three over four	Three over one	sd	4
Three over one	Yes Marcoua	sd	1
What would that give you real quick	Nine fourths	sd	4
Nine fourths and what is nine fourths equal to	Its going to be equal to	sv	1
The next one we are going to have Bruce	I was saying that three fourths is greater	sd	4
Georgia tell me why you disagree with it	Why I disagree because I know 34 times one equals 34 that will be equal to	sd	5
Is it greater than less than or equal to 34	I think that 34 is bigger	sv	4
You think that 34 is bigger so 34 times 1 12 is less than	Yes	b	1
Asher tell me why you agree with this	Because three times one equals three and then four times two equals eight	sd	5
Because three times one equals three and then four times two equals eight	I know that 38 is less than a half and 34 is over a half	sd	5
I know that 38 is less than a half and 34 is over a half	34 is bigger	sd	5

You think	Yes	b	1
Tell me how you would write a number story	I think into	sv	1
How many than what youre expecting	Seven times eight	sd	4
Seven times eight	I switched	sd	4
Okay thank you	You multiply them	sd	4
I do have apples come here	Okay Ive finished 56	sd	1
Raymond I need your voice off	Me and my team did equal groups because we thought that would be the easiest one	sd	5
Okay so lets see what they wrote	There are 56 kids in a spot and the Ms Strathom would want eight equal groups	sd	4
There are 56 kids in a spot and the Ms Strathom would want eight equal groups	How many children are in each group	sd	4
Tell me Roge	Seven	sd	4
Explain your process that you used	If she wants 8 equal groups that means 7 people are going to be in each group because that will be 56 students	sd	5
Is there a different mathematical process that I could use	Maybe 7 times 856	sd	5
Youre going to start seeing  during math	Okay	b	1
Go ahead	Yes	b	1
Yes	Well you could do like what Daniel did 5687 or 8756	sd	5
Okay do you see why I want to go to that party I get seven cupcakes	Cupcakes yes	aa	1
Cupcakes yes	Except that might be too much frosting	sd	1
All right so Margo you are up	This is what we did	sd	1
Bring it over here so we can see it please	What we did was we did now we have a length of 7 and we have a width of 8 and then if you multiply them together youll get 56	sd	5
Does that work	Yes	b	1
What are you figuring out there	Youre multiplying 78	aa	4
To get what	To get 56	sd	4
Theyre talking about inches we know that theyre coming up with 56	Widthlength Well its like 78 like widthlength	sd	4
Lengthwidth	The area	sd	4
Could you  so that we can see it all	There are 56 kids which we used to split the kids into eight groups	sd	4
There are 56 kids which we used to split the kids into eight groups	How many kids are in the groups	sd	4
Missy explain	So we saw ours we could do 568	sd	4
Okay or	I cant do 568 87	sd	1
Okay last but certainly not least Franc	My table group came up with	sd	1
Go ahead	My table group came up with Bill had seven cookies	sd	4
My table group came up with Bill had seven cookies	His friend had eight times as more cookies than him	sd	4
His friend had eight times as more cookies than him	How many cookies does his friend have	sd	4
Vicki tell me how youre going to solve this	We do 78 56	sd	5
Could I divide in this instance	No	b	1
Call a friend if you dont know	Were not dividing	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
You guys did a great job with that	Thank you	aa	1
So now Im going to display two more numbers	Wait two	sd	1
Do you have a question	No I already know	sd	1
No I havent even given you the number story how can you have an answer	Sorry	b	1
Start the conversation	Okay	b	1
Go	Okay	b	1
Okay	9 x 2  18	b	5
Then Alexander is going to go because always Christie is explaining right now what does he think	So thats our answer of 13 then times two to get 23 as you said	sv	4
Has everybody at the table talked	Except Christian	sd	1
They havent called you out yet thats why	Im going to do the same thing Im just going to do it with certain change	sd	4
You guys done	Yes	b	1
Hudson go ahead and talk to us about what your table group talked about	We said it was three because three	sd	4
I need to know what mathematical process you would use why and how much of his allowance did he spend	Franc	sd	1
Franc dont forget your owl buddy	Oh yes	b	1
Okay	We could use multiplication because 3 x 2  6 which is 23 of nine and that he spent six of his allowance	sd	5
Six dollars of his allowance	Six dollars	sd	1
Rebecca what did you guys talk about	So we did 933 and 3 x 2  6	sd	5
So we did 933 and 3 x 2  6	So we know that 933 so we have 93	sd	5
So we know that 933 so we have 93	No	b	1
No	It was	sd	1
Would you find a friend at your table to help you out please	Come	sd	1
Come	So we did 93  3 because theres thirds so you have to divide it by three and then we times it by two because two its not 13 so it will be 2 x 3 divided it in thirds then 3 x 2  6 and six is how much he spent of that allowance and then two dollars is whats left	sd	5
What did you guys figure out Becca what did you talk about	I said that we figured out you have to do multiplication so I made the nine into a fraction to make it easier to do the multiplication and I got 253 and three can go into 25 and I got 8 13	sd	5
Can they spend 8 13 of their allowance	Yes	b	2
Yes	No	b	2
No	You have to save nine dollars	sd	4
Can I spend 8 13	No	b	1
Does that make sense	No	b	1
Marco can you explain the next step	Missy	sd	1

Thank you for being so polite	Thank you	aa	1
Go ahead guys	Were going to cut this out and then were going to	sd	4
Were going to cut this out and then were going to	Then were going to pair them with the multiplication board and see what	sd	4
Match them and then what are we going to do	Then were going to make posters on how we did the rest	sd	4
Friends Miss Rays and I are collecting the papers so just go right to work	Okay	b	1
Remember to match each one of those cards before you move on	Okay come on lets do this	sd	1
Okay come on lets do this	I know but we need to match the cards	sd	4
I know but we need to match the cards	This is one two three four five six	sd	4
This is one two three four five six	Six things for the six pages	sd	4
This is what I was just waiting to see explain why it works now Nivea	12 and 34 because this part	sd	4
Grab your platune	Fran	sd	1
And Kurt	Roge christoph and Kurt	sd	1
Oh Kurt is down with	Im confused how do we match these	sd	3
Pam pa ram pa	Pam pam	sd	1
Think about it where we got our 12 and our 34 to get our what Kelly	Our answer of fraction	sd	4
You just had the answer to that question that you were looking at	The double shaded fraction	sd	4
Go	So how does that apply	sd	3
Children	What	ba	1
Youre going to choose one go get a poster and start to making it	Its three	sd	4
Its three	Okay	b	1
Okay	One two three four five	sd	1
One two three four five	15	b	4
15	No its the one	sd	2
No its the one	No this is the one	sd	2
No this is the one	These two go together	sd	4
These two go together	This one Im confused about	sd	3
What general pages are you working on right this moment in time		b	1
186 because what does 186 give you the opportunity to do Alexander Nazarene	Write fraction number stories	sd	4
Go start	Where are you getting these answers	sd	3
Where are you getting these answers	58	b	4
58	Okay	b	1
Okay	18	b	4
18	Shoe sticks	sd	1
Did you match them all	No Im still matching	sd	1
Havent even matched two	No Im matching	sd	1
Is he matching any	Yes	b	2
Yes	Were doing it were like figuring out like with the double shaded squares	sd	4
Is he understanding that process	Yes	b	1
Go	Which one should we do	sd	1
Which one should we do	Lets do this	sd	1
Lets do this	No you just do	sd	1
No you just do	I think we do this one	sv	1
I think we do this one	And that one	sd	1
And that one	That ones easy	sd	1
That ones easy	Okay	b	1
Did we practice fraction multiplication	Yes we did	sd	4
Did we understand a couple of number stories	Yes we did	sd	4
Did we play around with real world contacts	Yes	b	4
a lot of that  and with your	But I get paid a lot of money I get paid 100000	sd	1
Friends I need you to line it up quickly after the work	Yes when I come to sit here	sd	1
Okay Im waiting for everyone to	Miss  comes to	sd	1
Okay go please	For number three I got nine tenths points	sd	4
Can you explain how that s an estimate	Okay	b	1
Okay	Six	sd	4
Why did you do two plus nine Clay	I did six five point half and one point six	sd	4
You looked at it and you just rounded it to the whole number correct	Yes	b	1
Bruce you did the same am I right	Yes	b	1
Your estimates are wrong if you just wrote down so ladies I want you to know too why you did what you did with your estimates	I dont want to	sd	1
On the first one	I did 20 then I did 90 which	sd	4
Part of why  going over your homework	From my first day	sd	1
Please mark them wrong so that I dont have to when I and you do in a different color you do in a different color	Is it going to be two	sd	4
Yours is correct	Okay	b	1
Okay	Is it going to be 250	sd	4
When you are done show me you are done by getting your  out and working on thats just 413	Because I wrote	sd	1
Okay so what do you get here	5 2 and then	sd	4
James do you have yours	Yes	b	1
Go grab the black one off my board please	Okay	b	1
Hudson you dont just sit there and not do anything without asking for help	I can do it	sd	1
Go ahead Lisa	What I did is the first one was 04 tenths and so you said to go a little bit bigger so I went one decimal I went one point bigger and I went to 05	sd	5
What I did is the first one was 04 tenths and so you said to go a little bit bigger so I went one decimal I went one point bigger and I went to 05	Then I did 03 tenths for the second one I did 076 hundredths and then I went a little bit smaller and I got 074 hundredths	sd	5
I need something bigger than 53 hundredths and smaller than 53 hundredths and I need something bigger than nine hundredths and something smaller than nine hundredths	Okay I can do that	sd	1
Come along Ms Hudson lets see what we got	What I did was I did one and four because if it has zero its always bigger and then what s less than one did 033	sd	5
What I did was I did one and four because if it has zero its always bigger and then what s less than one did 033	For the second one I did 015	sd	5
If I asked you to use them in place value how would you say that 15	15 hundredths	sd	4
Very good and that is smaller than or thats bigger than 12 hundredths	Then it s smaller and 12 hundredths is 5 tenths	sd	4
Is 5 tenths really smaller	No	b	1
What do you need to put in front of that to make it smaller	Zero	sd	4
Now	The next one	sd	1
I just  close their eyes	I didnt really	sd	1
You didnt really	I just	sd	1
Before I go on Im going to show you something	How we can add it	sd	3
Franc I need you to stop please	Okay	b	1
Alexander please come up here and share your thinking with us	What I did for my estimate is I rounded 9480 thousands to 95 and	sd	4
Ive got friends back here being rude	7241 thousands to 73 and  22 tenths	sd	4
Okay	On my number model I did 9480 thousandths minus 2291 thousandths	sd	4
Is that two or seven and 291 thousandths	Seven	sd	4
Thank you	291 thousandths	sd	4
Do we agree with what Alexander did	Yes	b	2
Show us what you did	my number model I said I did 948 so you didnt have to round it which already pretty much rounded to a hundredth	sd	5
my number model I said I did 948 so you didnt have to round it which already pretty much rounded to a hundredth	Then 7291 and then I  29 hundredths and I got 219 hundredths	sd	5
Kayla	How did you find	sd	3
Finn go ahead	This is a four right there	sd	5
This is a four right there	You dont have to That means that you just leave them alone but it counts as a zero now since theres no Since you basically rounded that	sd	5
Im sorry I dont understand what youre saying	This four is supposed to be the estimate right	sd	4
Yes	We got four it would count as a zero because the estimate is an estimate its not like a real answer	sd	5
Youre saying he couldve just done 9  2	Yes	b	2
Thats fine	In your number model dont you just put a  and not the answer	sd	4
Say Might I suggest next time	Might I suggest next time that instead of you answering that you could put a letter	sd	2
Im not even sure where that name came from	Thats exactly what I did	sd	2
Thats exactly what I did	I did 9  7 because I rounded I didnt even look at these numbers	sd	5
I did 9  7 because I rounded I didnt even look at these numbers	I just looked at the 94 and 4 and rounded it down to 9000 three digits after	sd	5
I just looked at the 94 and 4 and rounded it down to 9000 three digits after	Then 7 the 2 is closer to zero  8 so then I 7000 and I got 9  7 is 2 then I attached the zeroes	sd	5
Hudson Im going to ask you to join	We already have	sd	1
Alexander where is your spot on the rug	Its over there	sd	1
Stand up and tell us what you said	I said that its not going to be efficient because you have to 9 is closer to 10 so you can only do the tenths and then you get another grid and then you have to shade it more of that	sd	5
I said that its not going to be efficient because you have to 9 is closer to 10 so you can only do the tenths and then you get another grid and then you have to shade it more of that	Then you want two	sd	5
Then you want two	Then you get the 7 which is also close to 10	sd	5
Then you get the 7 which is also close to 10	Youd be around three grids and thats not going to be efficient	sd	5
Youd be around three grids and thats not going to be efficient	Then you have to cross out all of the numbers on the 9 and the 4 and the 8	sd	5
Expand and clarify his thinking exactly	I think it would not it would be more than three grids because 9  7 is over 10 and you would have to cross out the two more You would have to count the extra numbers	sd	5
If I do this how many grids am I going to need	Nine	sd	4
Ashley how many grids do you think Im going to need	16 grids	sd	4
What two numbers does that account for	Nine and seven	sd	4
Zoey want to expand upon them	I think you will only need one grid because youre not adding youre subtracting	sd	5
Kayla what would you like to add	I think you need a hundred because I already told  at first we nine but then you have eight hundredths but you dont need a whole other grid	sd	5
I think you need a hundred because I already told  at first we nine but then you have eight hundredths but you dont need a whole other grid	I think you need 18 hundredths because  48 hundredths and then theres 298 thousandths	sd	5
Im sorry someone had a question	Are we	sd	1
Which of both of you wants to write today	Have	sd	1
Holly why don t you come up and work with	One minus zero he can t do that he has to cross it out put seven there put the one right there	sd	2
One minus zero he can t do that he has to cross it out put seven there put the one right there	Okay now put nine down there and then do okay yes cross that one out put 317 and then one and then yes that was easy	sd	2
Mariah go ahead so Mariah who is your sage	Joseph	b	1
Start talking telling Mae	We first wrote the numbers and then we started off with  it cant be zero minus one so we	sd	4
There was no zero in the problem why do you put a zero there	Because theres no hundredths I mean thousandths so if put there it wouldnt be	sd	5
Thank you	We crossed out the eight put a seven right there and then we did 101 because  we took a whole	sd	5
Did you take a whole	No it s a hundredth from the hundred and then we did 101 which we got nine and then we moved to the hundredths place	sd	5
No it s a hundredth from the hundred and then we did 101 which we got nine and then we moved to the hundredths place	We  with seven like this and we couldnt do it  we had to take one from the 10th place and then make 17 and then we did 17 minus	sd	5
Did you make 17 though or did you make 17 hundredths	17 hundredths	sd	5
17 hundredths	We did 17 minus 9 and got 8 and then we went to 10th place an then we did three minus two which is one and then did nine minus seven	sd	5
Could you read your answer to me Mariah	We got two and 189 thousandths	sd	4
Finn see me on your way back to your desk next up	First we numbers between nine and three hundredths and then seven  added a zero to the 128	sd	5
First we numbers between nine and three hundredths and then seven  added a zero to the 128	Then we do the zero thousandths minus three  thousandths minus one thousandths so then over here but	sd	5
Good	First of all we deal with the	sd	1
Nice that language	Then we attach those zeros because theres  we have to borrow 8 we make that 7  Then we get 1019	sd	5
Then we attach those zeros because theres  we have to borrow 8 we make that 7  Then we get 1019	Then we did  89	sd	5
79 go ahead	79 so we have to take away  to make it 17	sd	5
79 so we have to take away  to make it 17	Then we subtract it to make it 8	sd	5
Then we subtract it to make it 8	Then	sd	1
Thank you	First of all we knew that 9  is going to be a little hard	sd	5
First of all we knew that 9  is going to be a little hard	Then we knew that we cannot subtract one from zero	sd	5
Then we knew that we cannot subtract one from zero	We added a one  After that we  Then we did 23 which equals 1	sd	5
Thank you	Then we got	sd	1
What did you two do	01 we borrowed	sd	4
Why couldnt I have just subtracted 7291 from 9408	That what we oh	sd	1
What did you attach	We attached a zero	sd	4
Do you see what I was doing	Yes	b	1
The first time you did this problem what did you do Hudson	First time I did this problem was I made	sd	1
What did you do the very first time when I said thats how much material she needs	so we did 01 and then 89 and then 42 and then	sd	5
They added this first	I knew it was a subtraction problem	sd	4
What did you realize you had done	Because he had 2point	sd	4
	No I had 2199 he had 2211 and then we knew we had to change our answers  Then we crossed out that  181 17	sd	5
No I had 2199 he had 2211 and then we knew we had to change our answers  Then we crossed out that  181 17	1798	b	5
1798	Then we crossed that out	sd	5
Then we crossed that out	Then 321 and 972 so 213	sd	5
Would you phone a friend to add to your thinking	You have to align the decimals up	sd	4
You have to align the decimals up	You have to always make sure that	sd	4
Quickly	one number has more place values than the first one	sd	4
Really the bottom line of this lesson is today that in order to subtract decimals you got to make sure that when you align them if they did not put a number in that place value as Kayla said you attach a	Zero	sd	4
The only thing we had to do with that strategy is we had to make sure we incorporated a	Decimal	sd	4
What did I call it	The equation	sd	4
What did I ask you to create Dianna	I dont know	sd	1
This would just be four minus	Five minus three	sd	4
No four minus	Three	sd	4
Have you taken onetenth or one whole from that because the three is a whole number	algorithm lets you know how you did it the strategy you did	sd	4
Why did you make that six a three	That one is a four	sd	4
Did you solve problems	Yes	b	1
Youre discussing	With your partner	sd	1
You guys know what rules are right	Yeah	b	1
Once that shows up you can make revisions to things that	Things that you would kind of like revise and redo it I guess	sd	4
Okay	Unless mine was picking it up	sd	1
Maggie read it for me	I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule created to get the largest fraction in the game	sd	1
George	I think it means to kind of justify your answer	sd	4
Anna	Youre proving it	sd	4
Did you guys figure out similarities	Yeah	b	1
Did you talk about similarities	I did	sd	1
No one	was saying you could make that a whole number then you would report the number as a fraction	sd	5
George	I think its similar to a fraction because sometimes when we do	sd	1
Anna	So if we have a fraction  we can provide the numerator and common denominators	sd	5
Max	The dividend	sd	4
And the denominator is the same as the what	Divisor	b	4
One strategy I think you guys all talked about where Joey what was the strategy from yesterday	Um	b	1
How would you arrange these cards for the biggest fraction	The biggest number on top	sd	4
Biggest numbers on top and then	Smallest on the bottom	sd	4
Gavin	55 and 8	sd	4
Did I just prove to you which one is bigger	Yes	b	1
What do you see	I see  the answer because the smaller the denominator the bigger the answer	sd	5
I see  the answer because the smaller the denominator the bigger the answer	So if you have a big denominator the answers gonna be a lot smaller	sd	5
What do you notice Sophia	I notice the denominator and the divisor are the same thing	sd	4
So what are you saying	Because the denominator	sd	4
Anna	They could show how they did their work	sd	2
Anything else	Maybe they could add like more words to make it make sense because my rule is the bigger the denominators or probably something different than denominators	sd	2
Howard	We dont know what cards hes using	sd	2
Im sorry	We dont know what cards hes using	sd	2
Eric	The explanation	sd	2
That important word and then it works because the smaller the whats that word	Denominator	aa	4
All right switch	That is getting nowhere	sd	1
That is getting nowhere	Like the first half is perfect	sd	2
Like the first half is perfect	But then the bottom when you get more to the bottom it doesnt get anywhere	sd	2
Gavin	What I was so Id like to share that so they do like a whole paragraph rather than the last one where they did like one sentence	sd	2
What I was so Id like to share that so they do like a whole paragraph rather than the last one where they did like one sentence	They did a full paragraph with first and second and then they had a conclusion sentence	sd	2
Anybody else	It said did you know	sd	1
It said did you know	Also did you know the numerator is the	sd	1
Was that important	Yes	b	1
Why do you think its important	Because I dont know	sd	3
Anna	I think that its important that you actually explain what youre doing	sv	4
Aiden	I think that  is important because  dividends when theyre talking about the numerator like the reader could get confused	sd	5
Max	I respectfully disagree	aa	2
I respectfully disagree	I dont think it is important	sd	4
I dont think it is important	I think it isnt important because he isnt actually explaining about what he did	sd	5
I think it isnt important because he isnt actually explaining about what he did	He like um he said Did you know the numerators dividend	sd	2
He like um he said Did you know the numerators dividend	And yeah like a random just you dont need to know	sd	2
Do you have an idea Max	Um I think he could make it useful by changing the sentence after that and do like since the problem has fractions the numerator and the dividend would be the same thing to like because its a fraction and a division problem	sd	5
Aiden	I changed my mind	sd	1
I changed my mind	I agree with Max	sd	2
I agree with Max	He could have drew a picture	sd	2
George	I dont really see an explanation	sd	2
I dont really see an explanation	I think he did the problem right but I noticed that his writing doesnt really make sense	sd	2
Okay	So if he could be more explicit then that would help out	sd	2
Whats a good strategy for making sure that your your sentences make sense	Not putting also because of not having random facts	sd	5
Jonathan	I actually agree with George	sd	2
I actually agree with George	And like he was just throwing stuff together and like it just kind of threw it in there	sd	2
And like he was just throwing stuff together and like it just kind of threw it in there	Like he forgot like his third set	sd	2
Like he forgot like his third set	He forgot his third paragraph and also a lot	sd	2
He forgot his third paragraph and also a lot	And also I agree with Landon because you really dont need to know that the numerator is the dividend	sd	2
And also I agree with Landon because you really dont need to know that the numerator is the dividend	Its not really that important	sd	2
Unless youre explaining	Unless youre explaining what it is	sd	1
George can you tell us what the two means	It means power of two	sd	4
A little harder	Not really	sd	1
You guys are awesome 10 to the third is	3000	b	4
All right heres some hard ones	God	sd	1
Awesome	Thats a big number	sd	1
George how did you figure it out	So you just put 900 and then you just add times 1 equals 900 and you just add three zeros	sd	5
I dont know what that means	Yeah mines also	sd	1
Got it	Yep	b	1
Why would I have you do so much talking about this Anna	So we know how to divide it	sd	1
Yes	So that we know how to do the problem and how to explain our thinking	sd	1
So you agree with him	Yes	b	2
I think that was about a minute	Yeah	b	1
Did everybody come to the same conclusion do you think	Yeah	b	2
Mia what order did you put your cards in	I put in order 96 divided by 3	sd	4
Landon	Because its a large two digit number and youre only splitting it by three	sd	5
Because its a large two digit number and youre only splitting it by three	So it will still have a large quotient	sd	5
Joey	Me and my partner think that it doesnt work because youre subtracting more or dividing more from the bigger number	sd	5
Me and my partner think that it doesnt work because youre subtracting more or dividing more from the bigger number	And youre taking nine from 63 which you would not get so far from that	sd	5
Avery what would you add to that	I solved 96 divided by 3 its 63 divided by 9 is 7	sd	5
What is this number called	The divisor	sd	4
And what is this number called	Quotient	sd	4
Quotient	Divisor	b	2
Landon	My rule would be that the largest number in the dividend	sd	4
My rule would be that the largest number in the dividend	and the smaller numbers in the divisor	sd	4
Yeah why	So that you have the biggest number being split into number of parts	sd	5
Joey	So you could possibly subtract more and	sd	5
So you could possibly subtract more and	divide more of the total	sd	5
divide more of the total	So the reason you would want a three in the divisor is because then you would have to take away less	sd	5
You would have fewer groups	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	To make the groups you would have to take away not nine but three	sd	5
To make the groups you would have to take away not nine but three	Well because the smaller the divisor is the more times it goes into the dividend	sd	5
Say it again Isaac	The smaller the divisor is the more times it goes into the dividend	sd	5
Logan	The largest divisor	sd	4
The largest	Youll get more more cake	sd	4
If I take the largest divisor I get this little piece	You want the smallest divisor	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
You guys were good at explaining your thinking today	Thank you	aa	1
So what youre going to do is play topic it with me	Sure	b	1
Do you have your cards	Yes	b	1
Whos ready to go	Me	b	1
Me	Me	b	1
Aaron will you play with me please	Yeah	b	1
And Aaron do you think that that is the best way for me to make this	No	b	1
Come on up	I would put 8 and the 4	sd	5
I would put 8 and the 4	Because the two 8s are bigger than the 4	sd	5
Why did you do that	Because	sd	1
So her strategy tell me what your strategy was again	So my strategy was to put the four down here because	sd	4
What is the name of that	The divisor	sd	4
The divisor	And the two eights up there because therere higher than the four	sd	5
Do you guys want to do it	Yeah	b	1
So is that pretty clear	Yes	b	1
The next thing I want to do No	Ive got	sd	1
can you give me one	First one	sd	1
Anna	Divided by	sd	4
Isaac	Divisor	b	4
Divisor	Attached	sd	4
Maybe	Quotient	sd	4
What else	Attached	sd	4
Attached	No	sd	1
Does it	No attached	sd	4
I mean thats what we practiced in our warmup but we didnt really use attach anything	Add	sd	4
Add	And adding	sd	4
Can Carson use part of your deck please	Sure	b	1
And then youre going to do it again	Are we doing this one	sd	1
Are we doing this one	This page this side	sd	1
So youre going to pick three more cards	You dont have to shuffle just grab three cards	sd	1
Teresa what do you like to bake	I like to bake cupcakes or cake that kind of thing	sd	1
What are your special skills	I like to make scones really good blueberry ones	sd	1
I like to make scones really good blueberry ones	I also enjoy cooking with German recipes	sd	1
I also enjoy cooking with German recipes	We like to make noodles and soup	sd	1
I dont love to cook but I do love to bake	Whats the difference between baking and cooking	sd	1
I would say like	Baking is more like treats and like brownies	sd	1
Baking is more like treats and like brownies	Sweet treats kind of	sd	1
Sweet treats kind of	And cooking is more like dinner	sd	1
Theres probably a better definition	So cooking is like sweets	sd	1
So cooking is like sweets	Cooking is more stuff on the stove and baking is the oven	sd	1
Do you guys remember these manipulatives from elementary school	Ours were on magnets	sd	1
Those are your sentence starters that you can use when you write your sentences	What are the yellow ones	sd	3
Jericho whats up	So for the green triangles do we count them it looks like two triangles combined	sd	4
So for the green triangles do we count them it looks like two triangles combined	Do we count them as one or two	sd	3
When I look at that it looks to me like there are nine triangles	Okay	b	1
It looks like they make up other shapes but I would say nine	What are the red shapes	sd	3
Lance can you start us off with one of your sentences	Yes	b	1
Yes	I said for every nine triangles there is six hexagons	sd	5
Alexia do you agree disagree or have a question about Lances statement	I agree	aa	2
Frankie can you share yours with us	I wrote for every six hexagons there are two trapezoids	sd	5
Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Lucian	I agree	aa	2
Okay how do you know that that one is correct	Because I just counted out on my paper that they are correct	sd	5
Lawrence really wanted to share what he has so far	For every three hexagons there is one trapezoid	sd	5
I want you all to look at that and evaluate if you agree with that statement	I did the exact same thing Lawrence did	sd	2
Jericho what do you think of that statement that Lawrence made and that Leland made	I think its true	sv	2
So how is that a true thing	Do you want me to answer	sd	1
Do you want to take that one on	Sure	b	1
Sure	So if you divide them both by two it equals three and one	sd	5
So if you divide them both by two it equals three and one	So that would be three for every one	sd	5
Yes Adeline	Can I ask a question about it	sd	3
Absolutely	So can it also be for every six yellow hexagons there is two red trapezoids too	sd	5
Because	Unless the top was	sd	4
If I want to divide it in half my equivalent ratio would be three to one	Okay	b	1
If we doubled it how many would we have	12	b	4
If we doubled it we would have 12	I have a question	sd	3
Yeah	Can you write on the board how many would be in two copies	sd	3
Can you write on the board how many would be in two copies	Because I did for every six	sd	4
When you have to double it again in order for it to be two flowers	Okay	b	1
Okay	So then 12	sd	4
So then 12	So we would have four	sd	4
If we doubled it Alexia what do you think		b	4
Or whats your favorite flavor of koolaid	Sour	aa	1
I didnt even know that existed	I dyed my hair with koolaid	sd	1
You dyed your hair with koolaid	Am I the only one whos never had koolaid before	sd	1
Have you ever had any kind of crystal lite or any kind of powdered drink	Crystal lite Ive had before	sd	1
How about Mathlans have you guys ever tried koolaid	I have but not much	sd	1
Angelina would you prefer mixture A or mixture B and why	Mixture B	sd	4
How come	Because if its super flavory it just doesnt taste as good	sd	5
Do you think that B is going to be super flavored or do you think its going to be more watereddown	Oh wait I thought the small tablespoons were the water	sd	4
Oh wait I thought the small tablespoons were the water	I would actually do A	sd	4
Tell us what you just realized Angelina	I thought that the smaller blocks were water	sd	4
But does that change which drink you would like to have then	Yeah	b	1
Which mixture would you like to have	Id like to have mixture B because the more flavor the better	sd	5
Were going to assume its all the same flavor okay	Is each of those blocks a packet	sd	4
Can you raise your hand if you would want mixture A	I would want water just period	sd	1
And the rest are like watered down is totally fine	But think about it almost four blocks would be the same amount of water	sd	4
Charlie what do you notice about these two mixtures	That theyre equal	sd	4
How do you know that theyre equal	Because theres four teaspoons of koolaid and theres just one thing of water	sd	5
While Marvin is typing Im curious Angelina what did you say for number one	I said they would taste exactly the same	sd	4
What two numbers should we put in there	One cup and four teaspoons	sd	4
Letter B	Can I try it	sd	1
Yeah go for it Elliana	The mixture uses two cups of water and eight teaspoons of drink mix	sd	4
The mixture uses two cups of water and eight teaspoons of drink mix	And then the ratio of cups of water to teaspoons of drink mix is two to eight	sd	4
How would those two compare	Are the teaspoons koolaid and the cups are water	sd	4
So you could have a bigger container if you needed	Technically it would be twice	sd	4
Technically it would be twice	Equal in one more	sd	4
But youre right look at this	Theyre similar because theres two cups of water times the koolaid mix which would be awfully similar	sd	5
Yeah	The ratios are equivalent	sd	4
The recipe is doubled	And if it just has an extra cup of water then its not	sd	5
What would happen if it didnt have that extra cup of water	They would not be similar at all	sd	4
They would not be similar at all	The mix would kind of take over	sd	4
Huh	You just said it would be the best drink ever if it didnt have that water	sd	1
You just said it would be the best drink ever if it didnt have that water	That would be yuck	sd	1
I said I thought that maybe Isaac would like it	Oh I thought you said without the water it would be great	sd	1
Five cups of flour and two teaspoons of vanilla	Vanilla is disgusting	sd	1
Vanilla is disgusting	You didnt finish the teaspoon	sd	1
You can just put it off to the side	A picture with cups of flour	sd	4
A picture with cups of flour	What would the picture be of	sd	3
Celine what are the two things that were comparing with the ratio table	Were comparing two teaspoons of vanilla to five cups of flour	sd	4
What are you tying to do	Times two	sd	4
Times two	Like double it	sd	4
And why would you do that	Because thats what it says	sd	5
Because thats what it says	Triple it	sd	2
How can we get from five to 15	Times three	sd	4
What are we comparing for this question	Flour and vanilla	sd	4
Whats my ratio of flour to vanilla	Five to two	sd	4
In order to solve this problem Jericho whats my next step	You have to multiply it	sd	4
Now if it says five batches of cookies if I multiply it by two Im going to double it	Multiply by five	sd	4
What do you think about multiplying it by five Jericho	That works	sd	4
Alexia why do you agree with that	Because it would be five times that	sd	5
Because it would be five times that	It would be 25	sd	5
When I multiply two by five what would I get		b	4
But we love your singing	Oh sorry	b	1
And 10 teaspoons of vanilla	That was this weird air conditioning thing that we have	sd	1
Yeah	Do we make a different one with flour to vanilla or do we make a whole new one	sd	1
Ill give you a little time to work on question four	I dont understand	sd	3
Angelina how can I help you sweetie	I havent understood how to do ratios since yesterday	sd	3
Mathlans I will see you this afternoon	Thank you	aa	1
Missy what did you use	I did  so what I did was I added  to get 13 then I added the  to get 5 then I added 1	sd	5
Did you do it	I have	sd	1
Go Nessa	Yes	b	1
You bring down the decimal	Yes I did	sd	1
Now youre going to start in the hundredths place	This is	sd	1
What	This is the perfect because I usually go to the strip my mom always have before the change come back she always has  estimate what I think the change will be	sd	1
Lisa what is the answer and how did you get it	I got 781	sd	4
What strategy did you use	traditional	sd	4
All right so can you tell us what you did	I used	b	1
This one	You can do zero minus nine and there are all  numbers with you  to take it from the two and make that into a one and then to make it into a 10	sd	5
You can do zero minus nine and there are all  numbers with you  to take it from the two and make that into a one and then to make it into a 10	Then I got one and I did that for the rest of them	sd	5
Whatd she do with the decimals	Aligned	sd	4
Yes come show us	I started with 1219 and I added 081 to make it just dollars	sd	4
Yes	and so you have to deal with the cents	sd	5
and so you have to deal with the cents	Just to get to 20 I will just have to add add 7	sd	5
Just to get to 20 I will just have to add add 7	I added 7 to get to 20 and then 781 to get the answer 781	sd	5
This one or the other one	This one	sd	4
Didnt have to do any borrowing We just did counting up	When you dont have to  and now that we have those	sd	1
Cash registers that are calculators	Yes	b	1
Yes	I feel that that you dont have to	sd	1
If you spend money will you add or subtract from your bank balance	Subtract	sd	4
To find your balance you would subtract what you spend right Nessa	Yes	b	1
If you make money and save it what will you do to your balance	Add	sd	4
James do you remember one of them	Finding the median	sd	4
What do you think Tim	The mode	sd	4
Whats the mode	The highest value	sd	4
What is it	Mean	sd	4
Julian how many people are in Pablos house	Six people	sd	4
How do you know	Because I counted three and then theres three on the top so thats six	sd	5
Leo how many people are in Yarnells house	Three	sd	4
And Eli how many people are in Garys house	Three	sd	4
Claire what do you think	I have a question	sd	3
Sure go for it	Because its two houses of six people and two of three and then two two are those typical values	sd	4
What are your modes	Six and three	sd	4
Youre thinking three or six	No	sd	1
Julian what are you thinking	Im thinking that its four	sv	4
How come	Because six times four is 24 and theres two sixes and it seems like its either three or six	sd	5
Because six times four is 24 and theres two sixes and it seems like its either three or six	Then I put it in the middle and I get four	sd	5
Okay so you were looking at the mode but then you wanted a number that was in the middle of the mode	Yes either four or four and a half	sd	4
Dylan would you like to share	Yes sure	aa	1
Yes sure	I drew the numbers out like two two three four four two sixes	sd	4
Where did you get these numbers from	I got from all the houses where four was and then I saw that six divided in half is three so if you put three on each side that would be three and a half	sd	5
Good job finding your median way to go	I said four because I took the mean so I added up every single person and then I divided by the number of houses so I got four person per house if there was an equal number of people in every house	sd	5
Charlotte who could we move first	We move two people from Pablo and then two of Ollies house	sd	5
Leah go for it	Can we move one Pablo to Yarnells house	sd	4
Can we move people from Brendas house somewhere	We can move someone from Brendas house somewhere to Yarnells house	sd	4
Nathan what do you think	If she didnt say I was going to say from Brendas one and Garys one here	sd	3
Yes	Yes	b	1
Do you know that he is the king of puns	Do all the Ts come in here for snacks	sd	1
All right crew	Youre returning the snacks	sd	1
Do you see all sixth graders at some point	Only if its on the wheel	sd	1
Youll have so much fun	Look at all of these rollers	sd	1
Sound good so far	Yes	b	1
Earlier you guys told me that the mode You guys remember what you told me what the mode was	31 2	b	4
That was the median	Oh the mode	sd	1
Oh the mode	Three and six	sd	4
Yes Kaitlyn	I just realized that because were splitting the pieces into average so theyre equal isnt that just like division	sd	5
Can you think of an equation that matches the situation that we just did	Maybe something like a 6	sd	4
Not give her that answer but coach her	Yes	b	1
Yes	Think of how youre going to get all of the stuff together so that you can split it apart equally	sd	5
Think of how youre going to get all of the stuff together so that you can split it apart equally	What would you have to do before you divide it	sd	3
What would you have to do before you divide it	Add all the data	sd	4
Add all the data	Yes	b	1
The total number of people on pirate street	24	b	4
Eli do you agree	Yes	b	2
How come	6 24 is 4	sd	5
You have a way that you can do it algebraically and you have a way that you can do it with a model	I thought if you If you took people and divide it by the number of houses I thought that would be finding average	sd	5
Yes Charlotte	Would the  all data divided by numbers	sd	4
Tim	What graphs can you get in them	sd	3
What do you think might be a common mis Violet did I forget to call on you	Yes	b	1
Tell me your question first	When youre dividing to get the mean do you always divide the little number of data by	sd	4
By the number of groups	Yes	b	1
What do you think	Its like when you move the houses maybe the misconception is that thats the number of people that were moved	sd	4
What do you think Claire	They might think of purpose	sd	4
They might think of purpose	By giving her line plots in general	sd	4
If theyre trying to find the mean using a line plot	Oh they might think that the mean is done like the numbers	sd	4
What do you think Tim	That they would try to find the median instead of the mean	sd	4
Yes sweetie	I have a question	sd	3
Sure	What do you do when theres a remainder	sd	3
You can just tell me	Elm street	sd	1
Are we doing that because its spooky season	Yes	b	1
Okay	Elm street	sd	1
Part three is Elm Street	Part B	aa	1
Did I say something else	You said part C	sd	1
We want to find our mean we want to find our fair share	Im just curious how you did the line plot	sd	3
The line plot	Yes	b	1
Yes Dylan	Can I follow this	sd	1
Do you want to tell us what we should move	Yes	b	1
What should we move	On Reggies house you take one and put it on Hectors house	sd	4
Can this one be Hector right here	Yes	b	1
Okay	Then you take another one from Reggies and put it in Brendans house	sd	4
Id like to hear from an A Dan why cant we just move that X	Because the Xs are houses and the rule is one house	sd	5
Because the Xs are houses and the rule is one house	We cant really move the houses	sd	5
Eli	If you move the X from four to six it would be like Felixs house getting two more new people and then everything would be there	sd	5
Four	Yes	b	1
Yes Claire	When were finding the median would you not be able to use the line plot because we havent filled up all of it yet	sd	5
You could do a least to greatest it doesnt have to be	Well be using these notes	sd	1
Just tell me what you think	Lafayette Street	sd	1
Violet how many people got asked that question	Seven people because if you count the dot on the line bar its going to be seven people that the dots represent	sd	5
Kaitlyn do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	aa	2
Kate do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	aa	2
How did you get that	I got that from	sd	1
How many people were sampled Ian	18	b	4
How did you get 18	I counted for	sd	4
I counted for	Yes squares	aa	1
Evan do you agree disagree or have a question	I disagree	sd	2
I disagree	I think the number is 10	sv	4
How did you get that	I count the people with number two ones its not how many people they were in total its how many people were in the survey and if theres 10 people there it means we have	sd	5
You can just tell me one two	20	b	4
You can answer that for me	Page 36	aa	1
You can do it next time	Next time	sd	1
Jessica which of these two words are you familiar with	Fractions	aa	4
What do fractions mean to you	Parts	aa	4
Mr Easton	Parts of a set	sd	4
Parts of	Group	sd	4
Bennett	I have heard of it but I dont know what it means	sd	1
Okay Adam what do you think	I think it means I dont know	sd	1
Okay Dominic	Decomposing mean when something breaks apart	sd	4
Jessica what do you think	It means that it grabs some stuff and I think they turn it into dirt	sv	4
Thats close	Turn stuff into fertilizer	sd	4
Does anybody know just what it is that earthworms redworms use to create fertilizer	Trash	sd	4
Trash and	Soil	aa	4
They create nutrients for the soil	They use food	sd	4
Thats one of the things they will do	Dirt	sd	4
They dont necessarily decompose the dirt they add the nutrients to the dirt	I think maybe leaves	sv	4
Animals that are in nature where do they go to the bathroom	The woods	sd	4
We are going to be decomposing	Fractions	aa	4
How can we break something down when it comes to fractions	Breakdown	b	4
How could I break this down fractionally	Ripping like half	sd	4
Okay so how would I do that	Down in the middle	sd	4
As long as I cut along this line here this should be half correct	Yes	b	1
But essentially what have I done	You discomposed it	sd	4
Ive decomposed one Kleenex into	Two Kleenex	aa	4
Do you agree with him	No	b	2
Are these two Kleenexes	Yes	b	1
Youre telling me that thats two Kleenexes would everyone agree with Finn that that is two Kleenexes	Yes	b	2
When I took my scissors and cut this in half did I cut it into two Kleenexes	No	b	1
How about size are they the same size	No	b	1
When I cut that original Kleenex into two pieces those pieces are not wholes are they	No	b	1
What are these pieces	Halves	sd	4
Halves	Two Halves	sd	2
As we know from our work with fractions in the last unit two halves put together makes	One whole	sd	4
If I only have one of these pieces so if I were to cut it in I use that one and I still have this one left do I still have a Kleenex	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
No	You have one	sd	4
No	Half	sd	4
Half	Half	sd	2
Anybody want to bet me	No	b	1
Now nobody thinks its a half just because I said it wasnt	They do	sd	1
You just said that what I did was I took a whole Kleenex and I cut it in two pieces and if I have one its 12 right	Yes	b	1
What do you think	One fourth	sd	4
Okay but to make 14 dont I need to have two cuts	No	b	1
Did I make two cuts	No you did one but then you rip the other one	sd	4
I promise I did not rip anything I say	Can we say open it up	sd	4
Did I make two cuts	No	b	1
What do you guys think	I think it is 14	sv	4
Did I make two cuts	No	b	1
What do you guys think	I think its 12	sv	4
I think its 12	I think it is 14	sv	2
Lets hear the 12 first	Its four pieces	sd	4
Its four pieces	Did you see that the original 12 was a whole and then you split it into two it will become a half because if it was a 14 it could become smaller piece	sd	5
Adam what do have to say about	Because the two pieces you chose if you connect them they make 12 of a whole	sd	5
Because the two pieces you chose if you connect them they make 12 of a whole	It takes four pieces to make a whole	sd	5
What you think it is and why	I think its 12 because if the 12 of the whole was a whole and you would split it into two it will be 12	sd	5
Tell them not me	I think it is 14 because two pieces of tissue make a 12 of the whole because it takes four pieces to make a whole	sd	5
Im not going to tell you what the right answer is	Were going to figure it out	sd	1
Tell us why	Theyre already connected like this	sd	4
Theyre already connected like this	However if you split into two this way you could both	sv	4
You said you thought that Sadie was right	Its hard	sd	1
This time those of you that think Adam is correct you are going to try to convince the others that you are right here we go go	Because yes he did cut the tissue in 12 and when you ripped it apart	sd	5
Are we convincing them	Were trying	sd	1
Is there anybody in here who feels so strongly that they are correct that they would be willing to make a wager with me	Whats a wager	sd	1
What do you have to know Laurel	How many cuts youve done	sd	4
What other evidence do we need to know as to who is right Dominic	That you opened it into two	sd	4
That you opened it into two	You opened each piece into different things things	sd	4
What do you mean by each piece explain	You open the pieces that you cut in half and then there are four pieces	sd	4
It was like there was a hidden piece	Yes	b	1
Okay good	The number of pieces changed and the	sd	4
Did I make any additional cuts	No	b	1
This is one whole Kleenex as far as you know correct	Yes	b	1
Mathematically what changed	Nothing	sd	4
Wrong	What	ba	1
What changed Lola	What changes is that you had one whole but now you decomposed it into two	sd	4
I didnt actually start with one whole I started with two holes but under the pretense of even though these are two separate pieces when they were together did we view them as separate pieces or as one whole	One whole	sd	4
This one whole even though I didnt cut it when I separate it how many pieces that I actually make	Two wholes	sd	4
Because if I would have separated them first like so what would I need to do to those two to make them look like these Rosalie	Cut them both in half	sd	4
Because if I just took this first one and I cut it right down the middle I mean this isnt going to be perfect because Im just ripping it right now but if I cut it right down the middle do I have the same thing	No	b	1
What was the first thing you had to do	Had to find the right one	sd	4
How did you know what the right one is	I had to attempt to put them in circles	sd	4
What do you mean	Originally I first started looking for the green ones	sd	4
And what happened	Grabbed three of them and they did not make threefourths	sd	4
How do you know	Because this is onehalf	sd	5
Told you	Oh its more	sd	4
Whats the first thing you tried to do Selena	I looked for my fourths	sd	4
	I looked for ones thats equal to fourth like big fourth	sd	4
Whats the first thing you have to figure out	Look for the color that only has four pieces	sd	4
Could you still figure out they were fourths even if you had 10 of them	Yes	b	1
Derek how did you know	I knew it because we had four pieces of it the two parts are covering the top half and the two bottom ones one on the bottom half then equals threefourths	sd	5
Not exactly	All right	aa	1
All right	When you put four of those pieces together equals  equivalent to a whole	sd	4
Of our fraction which of the two pieces are you actually looking for the numerator or the denominator	Denominator	aa	4
I dont want to discourage you because thats good thats an equivalency but I want the actual fraction threefourths but with no number three	One and a half out of two	sd	1
For now	Six eighths	sd	4
Six eighths	Is this	sd	1
Dominic your hand is up what	The part that is shaded is threefourths	sd	4
Thats just the picture theres no fractions there	Oh	b	1
Okay	Do I have it	sd	1
Watch what Tessa did and see if it makes sense to you	I did onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth	sd	4
Tell them why did you choose onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth	It would equal that when you added these three together because theyre equals three but you never add the denominator	sd	5
Does everybody understand that	Yes	b	1
Use your words to describe what you see	I see three out of four circles	sd	4
Out of one circle	Yes	b	1
If you have one yellow piece in your circle Ben what do you have	One	sd	4
What you should currently have in your first circle is this correct	Yes	b	1
Leslie what is it you see	Twofourths	sd	4
Derek is that what you see	Yes	b	1
Anybody see anything different	Yes I do	sd	2
Mr Griffin you have your hand up now you didnt see twofourths what did you see	They are onefourth	sd	4
Somebody who did what they actually Lets see something else Easton what do you see	Onehalf	aa	4
Uhoh Easton didnt say he sees twofourths he said he sees onehalf so whos right	Both	sd	2
Talk to your tablemates why are they both correct	But its also twofourths	sd	4
Tell them I already know	look like foureighths to you	sd	2
Whos right	Both	sd	2
Both	Because theyre adding	sd	2
If youre doing onehalf theres no adding so how are you saying theyre both right	Because they  the same	sd	2
Huh	Theyre equivalent	sd	2
Thats just it because theyre equivalent	I said they are both half of	sd	2
When you say that Hope what do you mean	That they  the same amount	sd	2
What do you see in front of you do you see onehalf or do you see twofourths	I see both	sd	4
Youre all wrong theyre not both right	What	ba	1
Because	Theres two	sd	4
Keep going theres two what	Theres two pieces	sd	4
Go	Wait on our papers or	sd	1
Heres my question are those the same thing	Not really	sd	1
Theres no not really the answer is no they are not	It takes two pieces to make	sd	4
But are they the same amount	Yes	b	2
May I borrow	Yes sure	aa	1
If I ordered a pizza and I had this much left and it looked just like this and I wanted to eat this Easton what would I be eating	Onehalf	aa	4
If that remaining pizza was cut into two pieces that looked like this what would I be eating Hope	Twofourths	sd	4
And then if I eat this guy	Twofourths	sd	4
But does it look the same	No	b	1
Yes now try to do another one	The  pieces	sd	1
Correct	Yes	b	1
Yes	Okay I wrote threesixth	sd	4
Wow you guys are doing good at this I wasnt sure if you guys would pick this up did you get it	36	b	4
No because in order to be onehalf it would be these or these but theyre not	Oh	b	1
Get it	I got 28	sd	4
Six becomes our	Denominator	aa	4
How many of those blue shapes do you see Ishmael	Three	sd	4
What is that one worth	16	b	4
Class what would it be equal to	36	b	4
Which we also know because were superintelligent people is equal to	Onehalf	aa	4
This is what we actually see with the blue shapes correct	Yes	b	1
Now is that correct	Yes	b	2
Why dont we multiply six times three and get 18 on the bottom	You dont multiply denominator because its still	sd	1
You dont multiply denominator because its still	Hes correct	sd	2
Hmm	Because 16 times three is 16 plus 16 plus 16	sd	5
Please tell your classmates what you just told me why that is correct	That is correct because 16 times three is 16 plus 16 plus 16	sd	5
Well heres one group heres two groups heres three groups and when we put them together we get	36	b	4
Yes	Is the math homework hard	sd	1
I dont think so	Are you going to come back when	sd	1
A fifth of that	I thought that you find one fifth and then multiply it by	sd	4
Is it gonna be more or less than what you start with	So its saying	sd	1
Fifteen times one fifth	Oh okay	b	1
So what is one fifth of 15	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
I want you to talk with your shoulder partner today	So all the answers arent the same because	sd	4
So all the answers arent the same because	So do the fractions	sd	4
So do the fractions	The fractions like the dividing part	sd	2
The fractions like the dividing part	Yeah you would divide the number by five and then multiply it by one	sd	5
Yeah you would divide the number by five and then multiply it by one	I multiply	sd	2
I multiply	I dont even look at the one	sd	2
Stand up when youre done	Five times six 30 seven 30	sd	5
Five times six 30 seven 30	Oh wait no youre right	aa	2
Any other strategies	I did five times fifteen	sd	4
Whatd you do	fraction of 15	sd	4
fraction of 15	So and that was three times five and I know three times five equals 15	sd	5
Bryson	Oh well I I realize On the first problem that its multiplied by one	sd	5
Oh well I I realize On the first problem that its multiplied by one	So and if you multiply a like one times two thats still just two	sd	5
So and if you multiply a like one times two thats still just two	So I thought of it more as a division problem	sd	5
So you divided the invite	Yeah	b	1
Anna	I noticed that dividing by five is the same as	sd	4
Bridger	In order to do division you need to do multiplication	sd	4
In order to do division you need to do multiplication	Its kind of hard to explain	sd	1
Zach	The way I think of the division basically all the time is like how many times can five fit in 35	sd	4
Yeah	And I think it would just be seven so thats how I did it	sd	4
So if one fifth is three then how many are three	Total three	sd	4
So youre taking this number times three then divided like that	Theyre gonna all be the same	sd	4
Why does that give you three fifths of of the number	Because dividing three by five like when we learn gives them a fraction	sd	5
Because dividing three by five like when we learn gives them a fraction	So so its basically the rule for number three but just kind of put in whole number for them	sd	5
What have we talked about	So okay	sd	1
So okay	So 13 divided by three times two	sd	5
So 13 divided by three times two	So a third a fifth and times two	sd	5
Whats another way you can think about it	This is what I do	sd	1
This is what I do	I do	sd	1
I do	I put 13 as a fraction 13 over one and add eight times two thirds	sd	5
Why is this not working for me	Are you clicking the button on the top	sd	1
And whats our denominator	Three	sd	4
Alec	Eight	sd	4
I want to make it into a fraction	Yeah	b	1
Two over whats the denominator	Three	sd	4
Questions	Were working in partnerships or on our own	sd	1
What do we need to do first here	Five squared	b	4
So four PI times  25  now	Four times 25	sd	4
Just how many of these squares	How like	sd	1
Meters what	Meters  squared	sd	4
Whats the easiest thing that we can get rid of to get closer to R	Divide both sides by four Pi	sd	4
What operation do we need to do to get R by itself	When you square root it	sd	4
So whats the square to 49	Seven	sd	4
How would you check it	Well getting into  the quarter Pi R squared	sd	4
Well getting into  the quarter Pi R squared	Saw that equals 49	sd	4
Thats the nice thing about working backwards is you can make sure you get the right answer	I didnt get that	sd	1
I didnt get that	Couldnt it be R equals  or 4 Pi	sd	4
Thats what youre saying right	Yeah	b	1
Square miles like a one mile in one direction one mile in the other direction square	Probably  a 100000 square miles	sd	4
Anybody have another guess	Yeah	b	1
So if you remember	500000	b	4
How many	500000	b	4
What did I just draw in there	Its funny	sd	1
Its not the	Equator	aa	4
Equator	Thats the circumcise	sd	2
The circus the Circumference	The great circle	sd	4
How do I solve for R here	Divide by two	sd	4
Divided by two what	Pi	b	4
So lets talk	exactly	aa	1
Whatd you say	I said 50 million	sd	4
Lets see	I was closed for right  here	sd	4
I was closed for right  here	Thats not minus the Pi	sd	4
Okay	And I was supposed to	sd	1
Final answer One nine Lets see here	You have to round it	sd	4
Yeah 197359 thousand Did you round up Sassaby	Yeah	b	1
I think its like two thirds right	70	b	4
30	Thats going to increase	sv	4
Thats going to increase	but not	sd	1
So just something to think about	So also the ocean number is rising as of today	sd	1
The other way you can think of it is four Pi R cubed divided by three	Is it the same formula	sd	4
What do we need to multiply here by the way to we get our final answer	The multiple of thirds and then Pi	sd	4
What is it		b	4
So 288  Pi and what are my units here	Liters cubed	ba	4
Volume of surface area	Volume	sd	1
What are we trying to solve for it	Surface area	sd	4
Before that	Im ready	sd	1
Well want to divide both sides	Divide by four Pi	sd	4
Just like this	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yep	Isnt  it Oh nevermind	sd	1
What that means is if theres a circle in the problem what should you have in your answer	Pi	sd	4
Which problem would you like to start with Alani	The first one	sd	1
Which box would you like to start with	The firstthe column	sd	4
What should I do first	So I did 20x4 and I got 80	sd	5
You may ask a question or tell me what to do next	Then I did 4x7	sd	4
Okay and what did you get		b	4
I dont see NicoleWhats our last step Josiah	We need to add the numbers together	sd	4
And what would we get		b	4
Or first I should say	Well I did 40 well I set up the table and then I did 40x30	sd	4
In order to get 30x40 what would that be		b	4
Colton which one would you like to do next	Am I allowed to do 35x42	sd	4
No because when we use an area model notice how we set it up we put up the 35 into 30 and 5	Oh yeah so wouldnt we just do 5x40	sd	4
Yeah what would that be	Wouldnt that be 200	sd	4
Landon which one would you like to tackle	30x2	b	1
And what would that be		b	4
Im going to let you tackle this Santiago which is this last column which 2 numbers are we going to multiply for the area here	5x2	b	4
Yeah whats 5x2		b	4
Love it thank you Alani thank you Shebby	I have to go grab something downstairs	sd	1
So Im going to do a few for you	What page is it	sd	1
Im going to do a few for you but just like when we did our warm up today I want you guys to be ready to answer some questions for me today	What page is it	sd	1
They both have 10 as a factor so we could simplify this to 14	So for multiplying 510 you dont need to find the common denominator right	sd	4
So for multiplying 510 you dont need to find the common denominator right	You just multiply 2x5 and 5x8	sd	4
Yep and on the next page were going to draw some pictures and talk about why that is	Okay and then is it the Finleye for division	sd	4
We will talk about division later	Okay	b	1
Yes Gemma	So I get that you consideredand thats equal to 364	sd	4
So I get that you consideredand thats equal to 364	Im just confused on how that equals the 9	sd	3
Yeah so 4 will go into 36 nine times	Oh thank you	aa	1
Santiago C	4x5	b	1
4x5 and what would that be		b	4
Josiah where would you like to go next	The column off to the right	sd	1
Okay what are we going to multiply there	3x4 times 23	sd	1
And what would that be		b	4
Cool all right Rene youre next which one would you like to do	I guess 5 times 24	sd	1
Okay tell me what I should do to solve that problem	I guess its just 34 5 times	sd	4
I guess its just 34 5 times	Or 34 times 54 which is 154	sd	5
Cool will you simplify it into a mixed number	12 and	sd	4
Youre right 4 would go into this to get to 12	Sorry its 3	sd	4
Santiago P what should we do next	Well do 4 times 23	sd	4
Crew what would a common denominator be between 3 and 4 and 2	12	b	4
Landon what do you think	I think it would be 12	sv	4
So that is why Im going to really encourage you to use an area model okay	Would this work instead of doing all the steps for an area model can you find a common denominator of those two and then multiply it or does that not work	sd	3
So you do not need to find the common denominator when you multiply	Well what I mean is 4 34 x 5 23 and you can make it 12	sd	5
Yeah you dont need to do that	Okay	b	1
Trinity what do you think we should do first	Couldnt you do 7 times 56	sd	4
Leilani what should we do next	56 times 34	sd	4
Yeah can you help me solve this one	Sure	b	1
What should I do first	5x3	b	4
5x3	And thats 15	sd	4
And thats 15	6x4 is 30	sd	5
Youre close its 24	Oh 24	b	1
Rene what do you think it is		b	4
Brenden do you agree	Yes	b	1
Lucille did you have a question for me	I dont remember what I was going to say	sd	1
Lionel it is okay to unmute and say I dont know	Can you ask the question again	sd	1
Lionel looking at this problem right here we have five what is this number right here	655	b	4
So how many hundreds Am I going to draw		b	4
Jessie How do you know that	Because it um if you actually like count back like the five on the very end is the ones and the the one in the middle Is the 10s	sd	5
Because it um if you actually like count back like the five on the very end is the ones and the the one in the middle Is the 10s	And when you go one more back its the hundreds	sd	5
Finely what do you what do you think	Im actually I need to leave to go to a dentist appointment	sd	1
This is a Why do you think we start with our big instead of our little amount	I think we start with our big amounts we dont get confused and think that the small amount is our final answer	sd	5
Robbie you have something else to say	I feel like we also start with the biggest place value so that were minus were subtracting like more and it can like waste less less time I guess	sd	5
If theyre going to get an equal amount	Maybe you cant do that	sd	4
Okay so Im taking away five off my table and how many hundreds do I have left on my table	One	b	4
Then youre gonna ask yourself again can I give each of my  five people 100	Yes	b	1
Yes	Wait what was the question again	sd	1
Because if I take my 10 my 100 here and I break it up into 10 How many 10s Am I getting out of 100	10	b	4
So really what Im asking you guys is 15 divided by five what is that	Three	sd	4
I can split my 15 up into groups of three and each person will get	an even amount	sd	4
And how many times do I have left on my table		b	4
And how much do I have left on my table	Zero	sd	4
Zero	And the Answer is 131	sd	4
If not I need to erase it	Im still writing it	sd	1
Theres that glare is gone	these steps very really remind me of the steps for partial quotients	sd	4
We like having steps because it helps us out a little bit	And also like the writing kind of looks similar	sd	4
And also like the writing kind of looks similar	Like theres like the arrows that kind of cut do like the line kind of thing	sd	4
What is step one class	Start with the 100s	sd	4
Start with the 100s	Divide divide divide	sd	2
class what is step two after I divide	multiply	sd	4
multiply	multiply	sd	2
multiply	Multiply	sd	2
Now I want to multiply four times two what is four times two class		b	4
		b	2
Step three	Subtract	sd	4
So then I say okay 8 minus 8 is	Zero	sd	4
now Hey Colton can you mute please	Oh sorry	b	1
Okay I had an acronym for this before	Whats it acronym	sd	3
Youre wrapping yourselves do monkeys Smell	of course	sd	1
Monkey stands for	multiply	sd	4
multiply	multuply	sd	2
Smell stands for	Subtract	sd	4
Bad stands for	bring down	sd	4
bring down	What about repeat	sd	3
Can I put four into it	No	b	1
Colton what is your question	Um I I made up one for repeat	sd	1
Um I I made up one for repeat	So do monkey smell bad	sd	1
So do monkey smell bad	Really	aa	1
I can only fit at one time	Yes	b	1
No	No bacause that would be in the negative	sd	5
What is 12 divided by four friends	12 divided by 4 is 3	sd	4
12 divided by 4 is 3	3	b	2
Step two is multiply four times three is	what was the question again	sd	1
That is step 2 four times three is		b	4
		b	2
12 minus 12 is	zero	sd	4
And then Do I have anything else to bring down	No	b	1
No So I am 852 divided by four is		b	4

The area model lets read this together	Area model a model for multiplication problems in which the length and width of a rectangle represents the factors and the area of the rectangle represents the product	sd	1
Definition of a factorTera	The numbers that you can multiply them by each other to make a product	sd	4
The numbers that you multiply by each other to get a product	For example its two times three will equal six so two and three are factors of six	sd	5

What would this be if this is one and this is zero	Two thirds	sd	4
What is this one Kayla	Two thirds	sd	4
Two thirds and this would be	One third	sd	4
Are there any questions about that	I just want So wouldnt that be four ninths becauseBruce said Im pretty sure thats how many of the squares there are but its not how much the perimeter is	sd	5
Perimeter is something totally different than what were talking about but youre talking about the length of the edges right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Not the inside	sd	4
This would be two thirds by two thirds and the area of the shaded rectangle is how much Vicki	Four ninths	sd	4
You missed a lesson yesterday so youre welcome to ask for a friends help	I think the answer is four ninths because theres nine in the whole and shaded four of the nine	sd	5
Penny did you have something else	You can just do two times two which is four and then three times three which is nine	sd	5
If you just use the algorithm that you proved yesterday two what would your number sentence be	It would be two thirds times two thirds equals four ninths	sd	4
Did you work withTera	I knew the that it was two thirds and  so I folded it three ways	sd	5
I knew the that it was two thirds and  so I folded it three ways	I folded it like this first and then I had to color it again because there was another two thirds and I folded it long way	sd	5
I folded it like this first and then I had to color it again because there was another two thirds and I folded it long way	After that I colored it two thirds of when I folded it like this and the I knew there was also another two thirds that I needed to color	sd	5
After that I colored it two thirds of when I folded it like this and the I knew there was also another two thirds that I needed to color	So I colored it like this because I folded it this way and like that	sd	5
So I colored it like this because I folded it this way and like that	Like this	sd	5
Like this	The part that was definitely colored ended up to be four ninths	sd	5

So what I did was I went straight from the right	And I kept going until I got to the coordinate 14	sd	4
Okay	Thats 13	ba	4
Go ahead	And then I went up to 12	sd	4
Did we get 22	Yes	b	1
Youre all disagreeing but Im going to have to tell you youre wrong	No we got 23	sd	4
Oh you agree	Were all agreeing	sd	2
You got what	23	b	4
23	I miscounted	sd	4
When we went this way why cant we go that way	Because wed be walking through buildings	sd	5
I cant take the shortest distance from my classroom to Ms Burnetts starting here	walking through the wall	sd	4
So its vitally important that you make sure and you always go what coordinate first	X	b	4
And then	Y	b	4
Very good	Wouldnt it be the same distance every single way	sd	4
I did I made a perfect square didnt I	Yeah	b	1
School to the pool	The pool entrance	sd	1
Um	The school entrance	sd	1
You ready to talk to me	Yes	b	1
And to the pool	that is two 12	sd	4
How many blocks	I said 16	sd	4
Ooh	Because you cant cross above the entrance	sd	5
Because you cant cross above the entrance	But you werent	sd	2
But why couldnt you have just gone	Yeah	b	1
Do you see what I did	Yes	b	1
So how many is it	14	b	4
Yes	I got the answer but I got it in a different way	sd	2
I got the answer but I got it in a different way	I didnt look through the last one	sd	5
I didnt look through the last one	What I did is I added the coordinates together and I did 12 plus two	sd	5
What I did is I added the coordinates together and I did 12 plus two	And thats when I think youre making	sv	1
Does it work every time	No	b	1
Okay	Ive kind of been looking at it and trying to figure out	sd	1
Trying to figure out if it does	Try six and five	sd	5
Try six and five	And that would be 11	sd	5
And that would be 11	Yeah	b	1
I keep kicking that Im so sorry	I think it takes	sv	1
When its not going to work is when I start here and over	Yeah	b	1
So lets see you	How I want it is that	sd	1
And when you got it raise your hand	Nine blocks away right	sd	1
Another place we could be	The pizzeria	sd	4
Where could it be Amy	Did he say the ice cream shop	sd	4
Theres one more	The post office	sd	4
The post office	I did the ice cream	sd	4
And were to see	Wait so whats our focus today	sd	1
Lets see if this is going to let me play it	That game	sd	1
I dont know if we can play this game friends	Oh I see it	sd	1
Oh I see it	Its hidden treasure	sd	1
Its hidden treasure	I see it	sd	1
I see it	Down at the bottom	sd	1
Yay	Yay	sd	1
So Im going to say four seven	Wait do you just guess	qy	1
So	Sorry	b	1
One two three	No you cant do it that way	sd	1
No you cant do it that way	No you have to go up maybe	sd	1
No you have to go up maybe	Maybe down	sd	1
Is it eight away there	Yeah	b	1
Okay so you see how youre going to play this	Yes	b	1
Explain it	You have to get to the coordinate and then it tells you how much distance youre far away from the treasure	sd	4
So then what am I doing each time	Youre trying to get closer to the treasure	sd	4
Changing what	The coordinates	sd	4
Yes	Do we go from zero	sd	4
Youve got to guess	So its just a guessing game sort of	sd	1
So if I	The first one is a guess and then youve got to figure out	sd	1
From now I know what I was doing was better	I was three off at my first guess	sd	4
So you think eight seven	I got the treasure	sd	1
Of course	Find the treasure	sd	1
Okay	No you didnt	qy	1
No you didnt	Yes I did	sd	1
Yes I did	Calm down bro	sd	1
Okay	I got it like seconds ago	sd	1
Clay	Our consensus was zero	sd	4
Okay and why	Because both equals to one and then 1x10	sd	5
All right we do not have consensus over here	No	b	1
Do we have consensus yet	No	b	1
Franc I think maybe your confusion was that you werent sure that the highest one is two so you had two and something right	Yes	b	1
Tera will you please tell me how you knew that two was the answer	Because I rounded one and then three	sd	5
23	23 is the number one well have with  so it will go under 12	sd	5
23 is the number one well have with  so it will go under 12	If you round then up to 12 then 1212 is 1 plus the other 1 is 2	sd	5
You guys all agree with that	Yes	b	2
Nessa will you please read the learning target for today	I can represent problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points from one section and applying rules to ordered pairs	sd	1
What is a rule	To apply something	sd	4
It means what	Adding a rule into a problem	sd	4
Adding a problem like that	Adding a rule	sd	4
Adding a rule	A rule	sd	2
Lisa	For example in and out you have a rule of  like if you do times two or whatever	sd	4
Are we all good	Yes	b	1
Mika will you please read the instructions from number one	Find the column labeled the original sailboat in the table below	sd	1
Find the column labeled the original sailboat in the table below	Plot the ordered pairs once in the column of the grid and the original sailboat on the next page	sd	1
Plot the ordered pairs once in the column of the grid and the original sailboat on the next page	Connect the points in the same order you plot them	sd	1
Connect the points in the same order you plot them	You should see the outline of the sailboat	sd	1
Whats the coordinate grid	Its like when a grid has	sd	1
Roberto	Its 12 by 12	sd	4
What else AJ	The others are 16 by 12	sd	4
What would be the first coordinate that youre going to plot	Eight and one	sd	4
The eight represents the coordinate on which axis	X	b	4
Youre going to plot these on here	Two times	sd	4
Connect the points in the same order that you plot them so is it a good idea to plot all your points and then try to connect them	No	b	1
Franc what would you do	You draw the dot and then you draw the lines on there	sd	4
81 wheres 81	I am doing it I am trying to do it	sd	1
Thank you Stella	Youre welcome	sd	1
Did you erase that line	Yes	b	1
If you look at the rule for the new sailboat one so remember we are applying rules put your finger on page 134 where it says new sailboat one your rule is AJ will you read the rule please	The rule is double each number of the original pair	sd	1
Okay everybody repeat that	Double each number of the original pair	sd	1
Student number two table four Franc what do you think our new sailboat is going to look like	I think it is going to be bigger because it said you have to double the original number	sd	4
Okay so how much bigger	Two times bigger	sd	4
Do you guys all agree with that	Yes	b	1
Say the word conjecture	Conjecture	b	1
Finn	A guess	aa	4
I guess yes or a	An estimate	sd	4
I would like you to go ahead does everybody understand what they need to do with the new sailboat	Yes	b	1
At the end it has to connect 70 with 81 and 20	Its going to look like an arc	sd	4
Its going to look like an arc	This does not look right to me	sd	4
All of yours should look like Penny and Bruce and yours doesnt look like Penny and Bruce either	This is zero it says zero	sd	4
Okay so you need to erase that and then these two need to be connected with a straight line and then these connected to here	162	b	4
Good teamwork	Its fun	sd	1
Its fun	It is fun	sd	1
It is fun	Math is always fun	sd	1
Math is always fun	Why are you surprised	sd	1
Math is always fun right	The next day the next day after the other day	sd	1
Nessa	Itll look like a sailboat which is bigger	sd	4
Actually its new sailboat number two	Do you want me to read the rule for you	sd	1
Angela would like to read the rule for you	The rule is double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	sd	1
Everybody read that	Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	sd	1
I guess they give it to you	161	b	4
Clay what is it	161	b	4
Did you double the eight	Yes	b	1
Did you double the one	No	b	1
Whats that	It says for 140	sd	4
The third one	Yes	b	1
Do you still need help	No thats okay	ba	1
Did you talk to Marco about what his coordinates are	Yes so this both appear if you have the first number and then the second number is the same but then what do you do for zero	sd	3
Yes so this both appear if you have the first number and then the second number is the same but then what do you do for zero	Do you just leave it at the stop for the second one	sd	4
Im sorry	I know its going to be hard because  I was taking the wrong thing because right here I forgot they had to go to the original number	sd	5
I know its going to be hard because  I was taking the wrong thing because right here I forgot they had to go to the original number	I was just doing the first number half of this number and then it is still the same rule	sd	5
Audrey	Its different because new sailboat one is bigger than the original sailboat	sd	5
How Shiela	How its bigger is because you doublecounted	sd	5
So its twice the  twice the size	Yes	b	1
Izzy how is sailboat two different from the original	Its much bigger	sd	4
New sailboat two is	Its smaller	sd	4
Its smaller in which way	Like	sd	1
What is the word for that	Shorter	sd	4
Shorter	Wider	sd	2
Its wider and	Its not tall	sd	4
Wider and	Shorter	sd	4
How is new sailboat three different AJ W	It is taller than	sd	4
How much taller	It is two times	sd	4
Are you guys not ready for your	Yes	b	1
I want you to double the first number	You mean this	sd	4
You guys are going to do this with the pencils on your table	We wont be able to see	sd	1
You are doing this one	Were you	qy	1
You are going to do When Mika is ready hes going to do the same one	Okay	b	1
Okay	And Vicki	sd	1
And Vicki too	For the ones that have one it could be 16 and a half and you have to cut the block in half	sd	4
All of you guys are going to do that one	Which was the number before the	sd	3
Which was the number before the	The dollar sign	sd	3
The dollar sign	I say we go	sd	1
Are you done	I need to reproduce that	sd	4
Do these opened cells look like sailboats to you	I dont know	sd	1
Does that look like a sailboat to you	Yes	b	1
I want you to redraw every point of it okay	Not on my book	sd	1
Not on my book	Why did you just clean it for	sd	1
What is this for	To make straight edges	sd	4
You connect those	I know	aa	1
Franc I dont have room	Wow	ba	1
Wow	Okay	b	1
How are you doing	Im not going to win the sailboat too	sd	1
Im not going to win the sailboat too	Cooper that shouldnt hold the line	sd	3
Were doubling the first number on this one so two	And seven	sd	4
And seven	Three	sd	2
And leaving the second pretty much	This ones supposed to be on this one	sd	4
To double each number so two four	They should stand in here	sd	4
Do this one	How do you do this	qy	3
We have to find it	Two and a half	sd	4
We do it one two and then halfway between two and three	Okay	b	1
Okay	What are you looking at though	sd	3
What are you looking at though	The  to question five is two and a half	sd	4
The  to question five is two and a half	It could be more	sd	4
Focus	I really loved this	sd	1
I really loved this	Its so fun	sd	1
Did you make all your ordered pairs	This is going to be super fun	sd	1
Keep going AJ	I am	sd	1
You draw that and then you count	Thats	ba	1
Ruler	Like that	sd	4
Oh you did	Yes	b	1
Let me check and see if its correct	Let me work on that explaining	sd	1
Youre supposed to	I dont want one	sd	1
Adjacent means next to each other	Thank you for allowing me to have my snack	sd	1
Im so glad youre eating your snack too	Yes	b	1
Zero and two tell me zero and two are	Zero and two will be  they will be here zero and two will be here	sd	4
You can draw a straight line Lets go with that box then we go to zero and ten and two and two	At 10 here is zero	sd	4
At 10 here is zero	That is zero and two  zero	sd	4
I dont know what you are suppose or not supposed to bring	Only your hat	sd	1
No coats	You need to bring a coat	sd	1
You guys can go	Now you know which ones  over the loud kid	sd	1
Are you the loud kid	Well a little bit	sd	1
Well a little bit	I am like very loud	sd	1
Tables have nothing to do with Star Wars	But were talking about movies and stuff I dont know why	sd	1
The answer is x equals what		b	4
You are almost there but you need to think about how you solved and got the 16 how did you get the 16	Because it is two times slower	sd	5
You could put that in your desk for now and then you can work on it	Yes	b	1
Thank you	Theres only two of us left	sd	1
You still have an ugly one	That is ugly one	sd	1
Is it still fun	As I start out going with eight and seven	sd	4
Are these yours	Those are mine	sd	1
Those are mine	They can be mine now	sd	1
They can be mine now	They are mine now	sd	1
They are mine now	Thank you	aa	1
This is the easy part	I know	aa	1
I just want you to do this one correct	Okay so	b	1
Yes	We got stuck on the other one so we did it we just did	sd	1
Thats okay I am okay with that	That look so bad but like we kept getting stuck and  did it	sd	1
That looks goofy right	Yes	b	1
This should have gone with five and fourteen	Okay	b	1
Dan how do we start math today	We started math with	sd	1
What do you think were learning today	How time and A proper time or	sd	4
What are you thinking	I revisited another lesson on multiplication	sd	4
Riley	Multistep problems	sd	4
Julia	Nervous	sd	1
Can I have number Whos number 27	You are	aa	1
You are	I am	sd	1
You are	Yes	b	1
Then be prepared to share what you agree with and what you dont agree with and how could we revise it	I didnt really understand because I wasnt here for these parts	sd	3
Do you want to share what you got or how did you do it	What I did was The principal has several questions for	sd	1
What does the question say	I saw how much more of would it costs to hire tumblers and a singing group	sd	5
I saw how much more of would it costs to hire tumblers and a singing group	What I did is that I circled both of these and then I circled whats inside the row	sd	5
What I did is that I circled both of these and then I circled whats inside the row	I did 22 plus 16	sd	5
I did 22 plus 16	Then I had 78	sd	5
It takes a lot	What I was doing for right here was I was using it so that I could do the multiplication and get it through	sd	5
What I was doing for right here was I was using it so that I could do the multiplication and get it through	I took it from right here	sd	5
I took it from right here	How I did to get my estimate was I just noticed that this cant really be estimated except for this one	sd	5
How I did to get my estimate was I just noticed that this cant really be estimated except for this one	This one can be estimated	sd	5
Go ahead	What I was doing here was I was doing the multiplication square thing basically	sd	5
What I was doing here was I was doing the multiplication square thing basically	Then after I got all those I started adding them up so that I could get my answer which is 528	sd	5
Looking at this When you look at the tumblers and singing group what did you multiply	I did the tumblers	sd	4
Tell me what you multiplied for tumblers	I did eight times three which is 24 and then I took this put it right here and then I put the 20 in the four over here	sd	5
I did eight times three which is 24 and then I took this put it right here and then I put the 20 in the four over here	Then I started adding them up	sd	5
What youre saying is you did basically eight times three is 24 and you multiplied by 22	Yes	b	1
Did you do the same thing for the other one	No I didnt have the time	sd	1
Who has something Do you guys agree with that	Yes	b	2
Dylan	Because he added the eight performers and hours of entertainment and got 24	sd	5
Because he added the eight performers and hours of entertainment and got 24	Then did 22 hours times three because Put that down there and then he got He added them and got 528	sd	5
Move your clip up	What I did is before I did my problems I multiplied the first column times the cost	sd	5
What I did is before I did my problems I multiplied the first column times the cost	Here I multiplied the cost and the number for quantity and I figured out that the same group was 48 because this one doesnt say it would do the hours	sd	5
Here I multiplied the cost and the number for quantity and I figured out that the same group was 48 because this one doesnt say it would do the hours	I would add in the hours if it said like packages or hours	sd	5
Owen	I agree and disagree because when I did this I added and I multiplied 8X22 then I did that answer from	sd	2
I have one friend who did 8X3 then did times 16 is it the same thing if you 8X22 Oh sorry Ive put the wrong one	8X3	b	4
Its true Logan why would I get the same answer doing it this way or this way	Because theyre basically the same number we just did a different order	sd	5
Right now when were looking at this did everybody bring a pencil	Yes	b	1
When we hear how much more what do you automatically think in your head how much more	Subtraction	aa	4
Owen what are we multiplying	I did 63X3	sd	4
For the singing	Yes	b	1
Can you explain how you got 63	I did 4X16 then I did that times 3	sd	5
Would that work	Yes	b	2
Would it be possible to keep it as three	Yes	b	1
Could you still do it easily in your head	Yes	b	1
What can we round to	keep it as four	sd	4
Why would that make it easy in your head Dan	Because 4X5 is 20	sd	5
Can everybody do 20X20	Yes	b	1
Now show me with your fingers is it making more sense	Yes	b	1
Can I have a friend read that out loud Julia can you please read it	How much would it cost to buy the burritos and the sandwiches	sd	1
What key words did you hear	How much	sd	4
When I hear and in my head Im thinking Im going to subtract or add at the end	Add	sd	4
Put it under that camera and compare yours to Julias to see if you agree or disagree and why	For this one I did 13X3 equals 39 theyre the burritos and then I did 18X6 up here and I equaled 108	sd	5
For this one I did 13X3 equals 39 theyre the burritos and then I did 18X6 up here and I equaled 108	That was for sandwiches	sd	5
That was for sandwiches	For the sandwiches	sd	5
Can we label the sandwiches	Then I did 100 andthen I added wait	sd	4
Did you add these two numbers	What I did was I did  and then I did 18	sd	1
What I did was I did  and then I did 18	Then I got 857	sd	4
Then I got 857	Because	sd	1
Are you doing a little revising right now	No Im not supposed to have the eight here I dont know how you do that	sd	3
No Im not supposed to have the eight here I dont know how you do that	I got 57	sd	4
Can you explain how you got 57	I dont think it was right but I did a I thought that I was going to do 39 and 108X39 but then I just realized that doesnt equal 57 that	sd	5
Look at your own	What I did is so this is for the burritos	sd	1
What I did is so this is for the burritos	I did 8X3 which is 8X3	sd	4
No down here	The 8 times and the 3 because theres eight	sd	5
The 8 times and the 3 because theres eight	Theres 3 for each	sd	5
Okay	so I do that and then I did times 13 because there may be 13 packages	sd	5
so I do that and then I did times 13 because there may be 13 packages	Then for the sandwiches I did 3X18 because 5X6 is 30 and then times 18 because there was 18 packages	sd	5
Whatd you get for your answer	81500	b	4
What did you get	852	b	4
Was anyone thinking something at the beginning but now you realized what Sebastian do you want to share	Yes well at first I thought that you would include the hour but now that Ive seen everyone come up and	sd	2
Riley Riley not right now	explain their answers I figured out that you have to add the hours	sd	2
If we do 10X2 is 20 and 20X9 is what	180	b	4
Who made that quacking noise	Its something in my bag	sd	1
Go put it on my desk please	Cant I just shut it off	sd	1
Let me see  what are the two things were comparing	8 and 24	sd	4
If we look here what are the two objects or the two words were comparing	Tricks and treats	sd	4
We want to get one of those values to one	Divide by eight	aa	4
Were training the dog looks like a hera to me what you guys think	A hound	sd	1
Lena	It looks like Jack	sd	1
That means every time he does one trick he gets three treats	Thats a lot of treats	sd	4
It is	Most dogs	sd	1
All right David what do you propose for	I say Holly gets for every one trick she gets four treats	sd	4
Good tell me how you did that	I add the four and the 16 and I divided it by four	sd	5
Oh whats your question	Since their treats are 13 and 14 then it would have to be a decimal point	sd	5
Since their treats are 13 and 14 then it would have to be a decimal point	Are we going to use decimals	sd	4
This bunny I dont know do bunnies rollover	Yes	b	1
Its just a comparison of two things rather than fractions theyre like a parttoa whole relationship	Im still confused	sd	3
Im still confused	How do we put the hamsters treat ratio between three and four without going into decimals	sd	3
Tell me what youre thinking so far	I think there may be	sd	1
You could yes go for it Sophia	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	You could  decimals	sd	4
Thats what youre asking instead of this thing like this one into decimal but what would the Hamster be	Oh maybe 135	sd	4
If we do the hamster we do tricks to treats	For every one trick thats three and a half treats	sd	2
Alicia	Thought it could be like a four to four	sd	4
What do you mean four to four actually	For every	sd	1
For every	Four to 11	sd	2
Four to 11	Trick	sd	1
Trick	Yes 11	aa	2
Oh 11	That would be lower than all both	sd	4
Do you know Damien	I dont know the actual number but I think that we could change the number of tricks that they do	sd	4
Yes to what	To three	sd	4
If we scale this up to three what happens	The we have to scale that up to 105	sd	4
Youre right	the hamster gets more treats than	sv	4
Theyre getting in the middle	Basically 1 and 35	sd	4
That you see how it would be in the middle	Yes	b	1
Yes	That makes sense	sd	1
Do you notice how we have two for all of these its a little bit easier to compare all of them	Yes	b	1
Im going to need a little bit of help remembering where we left off	Its 51 correct	sd	1
We ended by talking about	That we had to take away a whole five students and one adult	sd	4
We got 207 total people on the trip	Wait	sd	1
Yes	You added which ones	sd	3
We need to get our total number of students up to what number Crew	172	b	4
What do you guys think	Yes	b	2
Why does that make sense David	It makes sense because we have 38	sd	2
It makes sense because we have 38	Dont we have 35 students	sd	2
How do we know that we need to get this up to 172	Not sure	sd	1
Whats up Andrew	Can I give a possible	sd	1
Sure	75	b	4
Do you have any questions as were going through	Miss Davies	sd	1
Yes	Why cant you do four	sd	3
Why couldnt I multiply by four	Yes	b	1
Yes Rose	When you multiply the ones to the five instead of using 30 to the five could you also multiply  use the five on the bottom	sd	4
Will you put the magnet in too	Yes	b	1
Yes	Im totally confusedhow you went back to the oneinstead of doing	sd	3
Other people probably have this question	Yes	b	1
Yes Luna	You went back to the one why did you  in the first place	sd	3
Yes	If you didnt have any directions telling you how would you know	sd	3
It looks like my smart board may have frozen	Again	sd	1
Can I borrow somebodys notebook today	Yes	b	1
Yes	You can borrow mine	sd	1
Will you put the magnet in too	No	b	1
We just know that we need to get our number of bars up to 130	100 what	ba	3
100 what	130	b	4
You could have done something else	Like 10	sd	4
Remember were trying to get to 130	Yes	b	1
Yes	Could we multiply it by the first column	sd	4
Wait  multiply that column we can add a column	Yes	b	1
Whats 5 x 5	25	b	4
Whats 5 x 40	200	b	4
200	200	b	2
Do you think we need to go all the way to 200	No	b	1
Do you have a different proposal	Times by two and then add column one	sd	4
Cole what are you thinking	Maybe you multiply by 3	sd	4
How comes youre proposing three	I you do 3 x 4 that would be 12	sd	5
I you do 3 x 4 that would be 12	Since its 40 it would be 120	sd	5
Since its 40 it would be 120	Thats really close to 130	sv	5
Chase do you like to coach Maria	Well you could add maybe the first column and then	sd	4
Make sure youre coaching	You could see if you could add one of the columns maybe twice or	sd	2
Sophia what are you thinking	You could see its in another column that you could use not just the 40	sd	4
Andrew what do we need to do make sure that we have enough bars for everybody	You just add the one column one more time then you would need 17 boxes with six extra bars	sd	4
To start multiplying by  then to subtract	Leave it in the comment section and subscribe to Pewdiepie and	sd	1
Leave it in the comment section and subscribe to Pewdiepie and	Can I go to the restroom	sd	1
Perfect	Can I go to the restroom	sd	1
Wait hold on before we do if you have one of these markers on your desk press the on button just to turn it on	Oh okay	b	1
So who else had this on their desk	Hunter did	sd	1
Can you turn it on	Its on the side	sd	1
Its on the side	The little power button	sd	1
The little power button	Did you press the red button	sd	1
Miller can you tell us what are benchmark fractions	A benchmark fraction is one and half or maybe three fourths or one fourth	sd	4
Kingsley why do we use benchmark fractions	To estimate	sd	4
So if we were looking for the three fourths then we would look at the benchmarks and say Well which one is it closer to	Is it closer to one or one half	sd	4
Number line on the top of page 88	This is page 88	sd	1

Mark the number line with your estimate and label it B	What page is it	sd	1
So on your white boards solve this and then label your estimate with B	Arent we on three seven	sd	1
Arent we on three seven	Three eight	sd	1
No I switched it so were on the right lesson	What lesson is it	sd	1
Three seven	Because every time I would	sd	1

Do the two of you have math you need to be doing	Okay well this is fun	aa	1
Okay well this is fun	Every single	sd	1
I would like you to share with your partner	My shoulder partner	sd	1
I would like the person who shares first is going to be has the most pets and you each have 30 seconds	Overall in our whole family	sd	1
No it is not important enough for us to waste time having a discussion about what pets qualify	Ive got four	sd	1
Raise your hand if youre going first	How many pets do you have	sd	3
How many pets do you have	Wait does made up pets count	sd	2
You have 30 seconds to share where you put B and what your reasoning is	I think B goes here because if B goes here its because	sd	4
Charlie would you please share where you put B on your number line	I put it in between one and one half and two	sd	4
Why did you do that	Because with the equation I just did one third plus one and three fourths and I got two and four thirds	sd	5
Miller what do you think about Charlies answer	I disagree because its a ray over a half and it added like a two basically because three is bigger than one fourth so I added that	sd	5
I disagree because its a ray over a half and it added like a two basically because three is bigger than one fourth so I added that	Not really I just	sd	1
Not really I just	In my head	sd	1
Frida what do you think about what they said	I agree more with Miller	sd	2
I agree more with Miller	My answer was between two and two and a half so I got two and one fourths	sd	5
Okay	So what I got was	sd	1
So what I got was	I got around two because one and three fourths is above one and one half plus the one third Thats kind of a big fraction so I got close to two	sd	5
Hunter	I agree with Nolan	sd	2
Okay tell me more	I agree with Nolan because I also got near two because we started off with one and three fourths which is greater than the half	sd	5
Great	And we added one third so I got right by two	sd	5
Lets do the Lets see what it tells us	I like this benchmark fraction thing	sd	1
That last row theres supposed to be room to walk behind you	Okay Im scooting forward	sd	1
Okay Im scooting forward	Capital C	sd	1
Capital C	Youve got to scoot your desk forward	sv	1
Mmhmm Lets see how we can use the launch okay	Well it sucks for pirates because they dont learn the alphabet because they spend years at sea	sd	1
Was 30 seconds enough time	No	b	1
So Abraham Do we know where your math journal went	Im trying to find it	sd	1
Im trying to find it	Im just	sd	1
Im just	Ill find it	sd	1
Were only estimating today	Oh we are	sd	1
Oh we are	I didnt know	sd	1
So now lets see	Thats me	ba	1
So Frankie will you please share your thinking with us	I put it kind of close to one and one half	sd	4
I put it kind of close to one and one half	Yeah	b	1
Because	I put it there because I feel like seven eighths is kind of like a whole	sd	5
I put it there because I feel like seven eighths is kind of like a whole	Really close to a whole	sd	5
What did you Frankies answer	I slightly disagree with him but I get how he got his answer	sd	2
Okay	So Im pretty sure that he probably got the right answer because I actually moved up the seven to an eight because I know that seven eighths	sd	5
So Im pretty sure that he probably got the right answer because I actually moved up the seven to an eight because I know that seven eighths	Seven is close to eight and thats a whole	sd	5
Seven is close to eight and thats a whole	And I also know that a half is half to a whole but then I also realized that its going to take one of the two away so thats how I got one and one half	sd	5
What do you think about what Parker said reflecting on your answer	Im kind of thinking what youre thinking Parker	sd	2
Im kind of thinking what youre thinking Parker	I can kind of see why you chose that answer	sd	2
So Parker your thinking that you explained	Dang it I did it again	sd	1
Dang it I did it again	Ah I thought it was addition	sd	4
Ah I thought it was addition	Me too	sd	2
Me too	Same	sd	2
Same	I thought it was addition	sd	2
I thought it was addition	I messed up	sd	2
I messed up	We all messed up	sd	2
We all messed up	We thought it was addition	sd	2
Oh	I got one half	sd	4
I got one half	A little more than one half	sd	4
Thats what I literally just said the answer would be a little more than one half	I thought you said one and one half	sd	1
I said it would be a little more than one and a half	Is it a half	sd	4
No	Half	sd	4
Half	One and a half	sd	4
One and a half	One and a half	sd	2
One and a half	So one whole	sd	2
So one whole	Okay	b	1
Okay	One and a half	sd	2
One and a half	Half of one	sd	2
Half of one	So one and one half	sd	2
So one and one half	Yes	b	2
Yes	Okay	b	1
I think sometimes theres a habit of you like just see the numbers and you go to work	Nope	sd	1
Nope	Hmhmm	b	1
So we read we just didnt get a picture in our head of what was happening	No	b	1
Okay	I read it carefully but I didnt realize it was supposed to be subtraction	sd	4
Lets do our next one	Next time Ill read it carefully	sd	1
Who knows	Now I can do it	sd	1
Can I ask what youre typing Nelson	Hes on email	sd	1
Hes on email	Yeah he is	sd	1
Yeah he is	Hes on Gmail	sd	1
Like right in front of my face and type an email	Its hard not to actually	sd	1
I know its hard not to But you can do hard things	I think I saw one of these	sd	1
Why arent we just using the white board on this	Label your answer D	sd	1
Im not laughing	I found something bad on the back of my white board	sd	1
Alrighty my friends	I havent got my answer	sd	1
Im giving a chance	Its a baby calculator	sd	1
Its a baby calculator	Did you have a Frida in your class that was LILI	sd	1
Huhuh Are you doing math right now	Yeah	b	1
Raise your hand if youre sharing first	Im sharing first	sd	1
Alright	Aw	b	1
Aw	I got my answer wrong	sd	1
Share your opinion	Okay well Im on a roll	sd	1
Okay well Im on a roll	I kind of made a Because at my old school what we would do when were estimating fractions Well just bump one up so I bumped the two up to a four and then I did four plus four	sd	5
Right	Yeah	b	1
Two and one fourth See can I tell you guys something Im noticing	Yeah	b	1
Parkers talking not paying attention	What	ba	1
Is that clear	Yes	b	1
Isnt that closer to a two than it is to three	Yeah	b	1
So I dont know why we would bump it up to four	Oh so would I have bumped it up to a three	sd	4
Which benchmark fraction its closer to and its closer to two than it is to three	Okay	b	1
Let me show you something	Its kind of floating in my mind	sd	1
Or lets look at this number line right here	Yeah	aa	1
Im going to take a token away from you every time you do that	Okay	b	1
Okay	I only have one token	sd	1
Then it sounds like youre going to owe me some	I was about to say you could just do the line	sd	4
Two and one fourth is about here right	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense to you	It will soon enough	sd	1
Do you agree that this is two and one fourth	Yes	b	1
Is it closer to two or is it closer to three	Closer to two	sd	4
Did that make sense now	I think I got the answer wrong	sd	4
So lets just see	No learning	sd	1
No learning	Guys I can do hard things	sd	1
Whos number seven	It works	aa	1
Were trying to share our math thinking right now not having a whole side conversation to be videotaped to see how fast we can be	We need a video	sd	1
We need a video	Oh I forgot about that	sd	1
Oh I forgot about that	I disagree with Parker because as you said two and one fourth is closer to two than it is to three	sd	5
I disagree with Parker because as you said two and one fourth is closer to two than it is to three	So then to me I thought it would be just one third after two and a half	sd	5
So Miller what do you think of Juliets answer	I disagree	sd	2
Okay	I would move it a little close except	sd	4
Alright Miller please continue to share	I kind of agree with Juliet yet still disagree	sd	2
Okay	Except I put it more near the three because I immediately the one fourth and put a two and a half and I just simply added one fourth	sd	5
I want to hear from one more person	Yay me	sd	1
Yay me	Aw	b	1
Frida	I agree with Miller	sd	2
Sorry Frankie and are not listening to you Okay	I agree with Hunter and Miller because I put it more where Miller said	sd	2
I agree with Hunter and Miller because I put it more where Miller said	A fourth of the two and a half	sd	2
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I put it more where Miller put it	sd	2
Okay	I put it where Adri did because I just broke up two from the one fourth and just did it two and a half because thats on the number line and instead of one third I put one fourth	sd	5
One more friends	We go to lunch at 12	sd	1
We go to lunch at 12	Every single day	sd	1
Label your estimate E	Okay	b	1
Okay	Are we allowed to subtract	sd	1
Why would you not be allowed to subtract	Wait we can	sd	1
Wait we can	No	b	1
Why would I tell you	Did you read the problem	sd	1
Sums and differences	I put my answer	sd	1
Sums and differences	Yay I put my answer	sd	1
Yay I put my answer	This is fun	sd	1
This is fun	Miss this is fun	sd	1
Im glad its fun	Okay	b	1
Okay	I tried	sd	1
I tried	Kind of	sd	1
Kind of	Well not kind of but I tried	sd	1
Well not kind of but I tried	I said Kind of because I didnt know if I got it right or not	sd	1
Fair enough	I try	sd	1
I try	I really did	sd	1
Alright	Times up kids	sd	1
Im not going to have you	It is next week	sd	1
Begin	Wait let me do my thing again	sd	1
Wait let me do my thing again	For it to pick me	sd	1
Twelve is our Piper	Yay	sd	1
Yay	So I put it right after one half because we were starting at three and I put 13 16ths behind from two so I set that aside and I knew that three minus two equals one so I put it there	sd	5
So I put it right after one half because we were starting at three and I put 13 16ths behind from two so I set that aside and I knew that three minus two equals one so I put it there	And since 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought it would be a little bit close to a half	sd	5
What do you think of Pipers answer	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So I think its right after A little bit to the side from a half because were starting at three and so I took the 13 16ths aside for right now and I knew that three minus two equals one so I started by putting a little dot by one so I wouldnt forget	sd	5
So I think its right after A little bit to the side from a half because were starting at three and so I took the 13 16ths aside for right now and I knew that three minus two equals one so I started by putting a little dot by one so I wouldnt forget	And then I knew that 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought that it would be a little bit close to a half	sd	5
And then I knew that 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought that it would be a little bit close to a half	I disagree and agree	sd	2
I disagree and agree	I agree with your explanation but I disagree with where you put your dot	sv	2
I agree with your explanation but I disagree with where you put your dot	I put my dot closer to the zero because I thought 13 16ths are more than a half so Ive got to delete a half so I put it more near to zero	sd	5
Lets pick someone new	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Frankie and Parker	sd	1
What do you think about what Miller just shared	I agree with Miller	sd	2
Say that again	I agree with Miller because three and two already makes one but 13 16ths is already half so you have to take away a half and you still have a little more so I put it a little close to zero	sd	5
So	I thought it was lunch time for some reason	sd	1
Just because we finished that section does not mean that math is over	Its not even 12 yet	sd	1
Not even 12 yet	Thank god its not	sd	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Ive already got problems	sd	1
Keith what did you do	What I did is since 110 isnt the same denominator as a hundred I can multiply by 10	sd	5
Say that again	Because 10 isnt the same denominator as a hundred so I had to make that all the same thing in order to	sd	5
Did you pick up what hes saying	Yes	b	1
Now what	Now you use	sd	1
Now you use	The denominators has to be the same so you just put a hundred as the denominator then you add 10  25 and 0  5  5 1  2  3	sd	5
Heres the other answer I got	Because he did it	sd	1
How do you think people came up with 126	They didnt multiply or add the denominator	sd	2
They didnt multiply or add the denominator	They did not	sd	2
What do you think their mistake was Viviana	They didnt make the 110 into ten hundredths	sd	2
The number one rule when were adding and subtracting fractions is that what has to be the same	The denominator	sd	4
Walk me through it Sonia	You multiply 2  5 to get 10	sd	5
You multiply 2  5 to get 10	Then you have	sd	1
Am I ready to add now	Yes	b	1
How do we feel about that	Yes	b	2
Should I show you what the other	Yes	b	1
Yes	Is it a hundred	sd	4
Is it a hundred	It does equal to that	sd	4
It does equal to that	But did he get	sd	2
But did he get	But does that still count	sd	2
Is it equal to 12	Yes	b	1
Yes	I guess	aa	1
Is it equal to onehalf	Yes	b	1
We know that 5 is half of 10 but we also know that we could divide how many times	No	b	1
Renata Xavier Hailey Martine Jeremy Josh Viviana Sonia  Judith	You okay	sd	1
You okay	Youre okay	sd	1
Identify the first thing	We have to get the same denominator	sd	4
We have to get the same denominator	Change the denominator	sd	4
Change the denominator	Yes	b	2
Do they match	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	You have to change one of them	sd	4
Caleb what would you change	I would change 13	sd	4
Why would you change 13	Because if you multiply 3  3  9	sd	5
Because you know that 3  3 is going to give you	Whatever we do to the top we do to the bottom	sd	4
Kai	It would be 1  3 is 3	sd	5
It would be 1  3 is 3	There would be a three where the one was and also a nine where the three was	sd	5
So wed have 39	Why is it so annoying	sd	1
Its because of the magnet in here	What magnet	sd	1
What magnet	One of the magnets	sd	1
Whats our second step here Hailey	The second step here is to add 3  2	sd	4
What part of our fraction are they Judith	Our numerators	sd	4
Our numerators	Our numerators	sd	4
Are we done	Yes	b	1
Pretty easy huh	Yes	b	2
Talk with your table about what youre going to do	Because the denominators are not	sd	4
Because the denominators are not	So first Im going to start multiplying 4  3 to make it  and then times three	sd	5
So first Im going to start multiplying 4  3 to make it  and then times three	Ill have 3  3  times 3 then 6  and then the answer	sd	5
Once you think you have a game plan go ahead and go	Six times three Oh do you put a 12	sd	4
Ally whats my first step	You multiply your numerator and denominator	sd	4
You multiply your numerator and denominator	So you can get	sd	1
Shes right with what were going to do but I want to know why	First you have to have similar denominators for those two	sd	4
Josh	Three times four	sd	4
Three times four	Three times three	sd	4
Is that all of you	No	b	1
No	You have to do it on the top	sd	4
You have to do it on the top	No	b	1
No	You also do it to the top	sd	4
Now what Israel	We have 6  1  7 and	sd	5
Renata what makes it tricky	I think trying to figure out what times four because we usually do the half of the denominator	sd	5
When our denominators get tricky making that change	Yes	b	2
Really are there a lot of steps though	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Talk  table	The denominators arent the same	sd	4
The denominators arent the same	I multiplied 3  2 which is 6 and then I did 3  1 which is 3 and then I added then I got 56 and its probably not even	sd	5
Do you think we have some answers	No	b	1
No	It is the same thing	sd	4
It is the same thing	Sure	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	1
Eli	I did 3  2 which is 6	sd	5
Why did you change this fraction	Because its not the same denominator	sd	5
So youre making your denominator	Balanced	sd	4
Balanced	Then I did 33	sd	5
Then I did 33	I did 3 1  3  3	sd	5
Okay	25  55 I mean 56	sd	4
How did he do	Good	ba	2
Good	He did really good	sd	2
Do you see where your mistake is	Yes	b	1
Whats different	Theres a mixed number	sd	4
Viviana whats different	Kind of its a mixed number	sd	4
Does that change our steps	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Kind of	sd	2
Judith how would you change our steps for this	Because you first have to do 1 and 23 as an improper fraction	sd	5
Judith says First lets make it improper then lets check our denominators then we can add and possibly we might have to go back to what	Mixed	sd	4
Mixed	Mixed	sd	4
You think you can do it	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
Lets see what you can do	Im pretty sure I know how to Im going to plus make it improper	sd	4
Im pretty sure I know how to Im going to plus make it improper	You just done it	sd	2
You just done it	No	b	2
No	Im not even  add those	sd	4
What did he do to add them	What did you do	aa	3
What did you do	I remember you	sd	1
I remember you	I add	sd	4
I add	To improper you have to  2  2	sd	4
To improper you have to  2  2	I know	aa	2
I know	53  16 so that 3  2 is 6 and then 5  2 is 10 so you have 16	sd	5
We decided our first step should be to make it	Improper	sd	4
Right	Yes	b	1
One times three is	Three	sd	4
Right	Technically it does	sd	4
Do our denominators match	No	b	1
So what do we need to do	Times two	sd	4
How do we feel about Elis choices here	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
Two times five is	Ten	sd	4
Ten	the denominator	sd	2
Kai	Its improper so you have to put it to proper again	sd	4
We still have to add	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Add	sd	1
Add	6  16 is	sd	4
6  16 is	I know its a mixed symbol	sd	4
Are we done	No	b	1
No	We have to change	sd	4
Now we have to go back to	Mixed	sd	4
Do I have enough to do two wholes	No	b	1
After seeing it like this was it really that hard	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
Take it one piece at a time	Yes	b	1
What am I going to do Renata	Youre first going to turn them into a mixed number into an improper	sd	4
How did you turn the mixed number into an improper fraction	I put  in between them the one and the five and the plus	sd	5
I put  in between them the one and the five and the plus	Did one 1  5 and it led me to five then I add 5 5 and then we get we dont change the denominator	sd	5
Now what	No	b	1
Now what	You do 2  5 and thatll equal 10	sd	5
Clara	We have to add 12  6  18 and then we have  improper fraction	sd	5
As hard as were making it	No	b	1
Lots of steps	We have to think about it	sd	4
Could you know how to do all of the steps	Yes	b	1
Once youve finished this problem youre going to check with me and then you can move on to imagine and get some lessons passed	Can we have this next	sd	1
Sounds good	Yes	b	1
Karla whatd you get for number one	2 and 58	sd	4
2 and 58 do we agree	I disagree	sd	2
Whats 7 times 3		b	4
Over		b	4
How many times does 8 go into 21		b	4
21 minus 16		b	4
		b	2
Okay 7 times 2	Wait Ms Koski where did you get the 16 from	sd	3
Malcome call on someone please	8 times 2 is 16	sd	5
So the closest eight can go into 21 is twice without going over but I have to subtract from the numerator	Oh oh oh oh	b	1
Oh oh oh oh	Oh	b	1
Number two Janelle	1424	b	4
Jackie	Multiplication identity property	sd	4
What did you get	1416	b	4
This is also what	78	b	4
This is also an equivalent fraction and its multiplicative identity property	Its because 22 is technically 1	sd	5
Number three Rodney	4256	b	4
Hunter	Two divided by 12	sd	4
Katelyn or Laurel	Well we noticed that there were two halves in one container where it said half but besides that we also saw the two glasses of water and we saw the red lines going through them so we knew there was 12 there	sd	5
What would be the difference if we did a half divided by two divided	A half divided by two would mean how many twos are in the half right	sd	4
But there is none	So that doesnt make sense	sd	3
I think Laurel might be able to help	When you divide 12 by 2 youre splitting it youre dividing your 1 into two separate individual spaces	sd	5
But instead I give them two glasses of water	Wait is this what were doing today	sd	1
There are	Oh okay	b	1
Harmony	Its kind of like this white bread	sd	1
Its kind of like this white bread	Its China its Chinese bread	sd	1
Its China its Chinese bread	And sometimes theres like a hole in the top of the bread where you can put stuff in it	sd	1
So say I want this vegetable in it I want meat in it I want this sauce in it and you can stuff things into it	You can also like cut it up	sd	4
How many pieces of pita bread will she have to share	Wait how many bread does she have	sd	1
Classityclass	Yessityyes	aa	1
How many pieces of something	All of them	sd	4
What is my number sentence Melvin	14 divided by 2	sd	4
Switch it	Or 2 divided by onefourth I mean	sd	4
Rodney how many	Eight	sd	4
Yes	Would it be 18	sd	4
It would be 18 if you were doing 14 divided by two	Okay	b	1
Who would like to read this problem aloud	Brian has three yards of string	sd	1
Brian has three yards of string	He needs pieces of string that are 12 yard long to make pulleys in science class	sd	1
He needs pieces of string that are 12 yard long to make pulleys in science class	If Brian uses all three yards of string how many 12 yard pieces will he have	sd	1
Okay	Your mic is turned off again	aa	1
Give me the important information	Brian has 3 yards of string	sd	4
What else	One half yard ball	sd	4
For this problem do we need to know how long 12 yard is	No	b	1
We usually do	Its not the question	sd	4
What is our question	How many 12 yard pieces will we have	sd	4
Classityclass	Yessityyes	b	1
Malcome	Three pieces of string in half	sd	4
Three pieces of string in half	Split three pieces of string in half	sd	4
A perfectly yard long string	It doesnt have to be a yard	sd	4
But we need to have how many		b	4
Classity class	Yessityyes	b	1
Six frogs	Six yards of string	sd	4
I dont want it to make it look like I wrote six and a half	I noticed something and like  like when youre dividing it by one half	sd	4
Put on your marker not your lid	So what I did was I drew five circles and I split them evenly into thirds and then I did five divided by 13 equals 15	sd	5
Grace	She drew her circles and her numbers very nicely so I could see them	sd	2
Rodney	So I drew five lines and I split them into three equal pieces	sd	5
So I drew five lines and I split them into three equal pieces	And then I wrote the numbers on top and it ended up being 15 holes	sd	5
And then I wrote the numbers on top and it ended up being 15 holes	So my answer is 15	sd	5
I want to see a clear number sentence with an answer as well	Ms Koski this reminds me of whenever we did	sd	1
Okay Finish up about 30 seconds to finish up your picture and your number sentences	I think your mic is turned off again	sv	1
What was the answer for four divided by 16		b	4
Rodney		b	4
	Is this independent	sd	1
Sorry I got to	onefourth and then	sd	4
onefourth and then	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Half of the whole thing	sd	4
Half of the whole thing	It looks like two squares	sd	4
It looks like two squares	Its just two big squares with four of each	sd	4
Its just two big squares with four of each	My answer for 2B was	sd	1
My answer for 2B was	Trapezoid	sd	4
Trapezoid	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
No	Fivethirds would be a trapezoid and two triangles	sd	4
Fivethirds would be a trapezoid and two triangles	A rhombus	sd	4

Yes	Its not a question exactly about this but what if you have an odd number and you try to	sd	3
Its not a question exactly about this but what if you have an odd number and you try to	So you decided to start with three right	sd	4
So you decided to start with three right	And what fraction did you say that these three were worth	sd	1
And what fraction did you say that these three were worth	Okay	b	4
Okay	Then I colored in two	sd	4
Then I colored in two	212	b	4
212	And then I added three plus two to get 512	sd	5
And then I added three plus two to get 512	And then I divided 212 by two	sd	4
And then I divided 212 by two	Because	sd	1
Because	Because it cant be two in the numerator	sd	5
Because it cant be two in the numerator	I divided 212 by two and the numerator and the denominator	sd	5
I divided 212 by two and the numerator and the denominator	And I got onesixth	sd	4
And I got onesixth	Then I	sd	1
Then I	Then I divided 312 by And then I got onefourth	sd	4
Then I divided 312 by And then I got onefourth	I think it would be 512	sv	4
I think it would be 512		b	4
	Its not a question but	sd	1
Its not a question but	I did one part just	sd	1
I did one part just	What I added to 112 was 412	sd	4
What I added to 112 was 412	We do to the bottom	sd	4
We do to the bottom	No	b	1
No	There was less steps	sd	2
There was less steps	Even	sd	4
Even	This is hard	sd	1
This is hard	You seem so happy	sd	1
You seem so happy	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So I started with 210 up there	sd	4
So I started with 210 up there	Yep	b	1
Yep	And for 210 I divided them both by two	sd	4
And for 210 I divided them both by two	Because in the rules it says you cant have more than one in the numerator	sd	5
Because in the rules it says you cant have more than one in the numerator	Now my pen color is black	sd	1
Now my pen color is black	Now the pen color is black	sd	1
Now the pen color is black	Im dividing them Oh my God	sd	4
Im dividing them Oh my God	Im dividing them both by two to find my denominator	sd	5
Im dividing them both by two to find my denominator	And 10 divided by two is five so I got onefifth for 210	sd	5
And 10 divided by two is five so I got onefifth for 210	That theyre equivalent	sd	4
That theyre equivalent	Same amount	sd	4
Same amount	And then for	sd	1
And then for	And then for 510 Now Ive forgotten what I did	sd	3
And then for 510 Now Ive forgotten what I did	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Um you divide five by five	sd	4
Um you divide five by five	Because then your numerator would be one and then you do the same for the denominator	sd	5
Because then your numerator would be one and then you do the same for the denominator	And then	sd	1
And then	Its half	sd	4
Its half	Its half of 10	sd	4
Its half of 10	Five is half of 10	sd	5
Five is half of 10	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So now I have onehalf which is 510	sd	4
So now I have onehalf which is 510	And	sd	1
And	Youre trying to make 710 so youre going to add onefifth and onehalf	sd	5
Youre trying to make 710 so youre going to add onefifth and onehalf	So	b	1

I need to go to the restroom	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	Do to the bottom you do to the top	sd	4
Do to the bottom you do to the top	210	b	4
210	You do to the top	sd	4
Zoey were you partner A or B	Partner A	sd	1
Zoey when I talk about how the placement of the decimal point will change the language would be I think that the decimal point will move either to the right by however many or to the left so is the decimal point on the four going to move to the right or to the left when you multiply it by 10 square	To the right because you are multiplying you move to the right and when you are dividing you move to the left	sd	5
How many place value	Two times	sd	4
Tera and Kayla youre not done	Oh yes	b	1
Alve are you partner A or partner B	Partner B	sd	1
The rest of you can sit down	I thought that it would be nine	sd	4
Okay so the answer is nine	Yes	b	1
Whats going to happen to the decimal	Its going to move	sd	4
Its going to move	Its going to move two places to the left	sd	4
Wayne are you partnering	Yes	b	1
The decimal place will move	Will move	sd	1
Which way	Left	sd	4
To the left how many spots	Three	sd	4
The answer will be	0805	b	4
805 what	805 thousandths	sd	4
Bruce are you partner A or partner B	Parten A	sd	1
All right that worked out well too so use a complete sense to tell me what is going to happen with that first factor	I think that the decimal will move five places to the right because since youre multiplying it by five you re	sd	5
By 10 to the fifth	Yes youre supposed	aa	1
Attaching	Youre attaching five zeros	sd	4
What is the answer	The answer is 7900	sd	4
Those of you who are standing will you please read the learning intention	I will use	sd	1
Go	I will use estimation to solve decimal multiplication problems	sd	1
What is estimation	Its you round the factors and the numbers problem to try to find around what your answer will be like close to an answer it will be	sd	4
Ready	I will know I am successful when I can solve and explain the strategy used on problems one and two on journal page 219	sd	1
Alexander look up here	I started  with addition I added to eight times then I added these two I got 16 so I put the six here to carry the one up there then I added the one	sd	5
Mariah you used the same strategy or did you stop in the middle of it	I checked it	sd	1
Hudson you want to share your strategy	I used this strategy	sd	1
Okay you guys listen up	I did like I know that one block is 12 centimeters tall so I doubled it to see how much two was and got 24 and then I doubled that one more time to get 48 so its how much four blocks is	sd	5
I did like I know that one block is 12 centimeters tall so I doubled it to see how much two was and got 24 and then I doubled that one more time to get 48 so its how much four blocks is	Since four times two is eight I just	sd	5
Tera why do I have people share their strategies	So that we can see different mathematical thinking	sd	4
Okay Finn come on up	I just put one into two different parts	sd	5
I just put one into two different parts	I did two times eight	sd	5
Oh lets do it this way	Twotenths times eight and then	sd	4
Twotenths times eight	16 and then the eight times one and I got eight and then I  8 plus 16 and that equals 96 centimeters	sd	5
Annie tell us how would you estimate that problem	I would have done eight plus one	sd	4
Eight plus one	Plus two	sd	4
Youre multiplying	I would round the 12 down to one and round eight to be eight because thats more simple	sd	5
EIleen will you please tell her again	I would round the 12 down to one times eight because thats close to 96	sd	5
Can you please repeat that for me	She rounds off eight plus  eight times one and eight times two	sd	2
Portia	I rounded eight to 10 and then 12 to one	sd	5
Can you repeat that oneKayla	Rounded up eight to ten	sd	4
Rounded up eight to ten	Multiplied 82	aa	4
You multiply 10 by what	By one	sd	4
Matty	Because you split it up and the estimate is close to it	sd	5
How did you estimate	110 times three equals 330 which is near 308	sd	5
In the second one how would you estimate that Tera	I did one	sd	1
How would you estimate that one	10 times three equals 30	sd	5
What did you notice	We already got the answer for 12 times eight which is 96 but for the one right before that where youre multiplying it times eight but then decimals moved over two to the left decimals are left in the answer and when you only have a decimal theres no decimal in the answer	sd	5
Norman tell me about the factors	I was going to say when I noticed that when you go down its just divided by ten to the power of one equals	sd	4
Portia what do you think	I also noticed in the answers the decimal point moved one to the right each time	sd	4
Okay what else Mariah	I also noticed that in the answers theySShave the same numbers	sd	4
What about the questions	In the questions they do too but the decimal is always in a different place value	sd	4
Okay because theseSShave different place values right	Yes	b	1
Yes	similar ones that dont have like in 12 times eight and 12 times eight	sd	5
similar ones that dont have like in 12 times eight and 12 times eight	In 12 times eight theres a decimal in that one and its not in the eight and the twelve	sd	5
Is there a decimal on this one	No	b	1
Where is the decimal go	At the end	sd	4
How can you figure out where the decimal goes on any of these	You can estimate	sd	4
Clay what does that mean if Im going to multiply these making them into whole numbers	Youre going to estimate them and	sd	4
Nope this one multiply	Wait you multiply them	sd	4
What am I going to multiply	You are only going to multiply the whole numbers	sd	4
Okay so what would that be	Six times two	sd	4
Six times two	You are turning it into a whole number	sd	4
You are turning it into a whole number	Wait are you talking about  or estimate  whole numbers	sd	4
First youre going to	Estimate	sd	4
Second youre going to	Multiply the whole numbers	sd	4
Now youre going to	Ignore the decimals	sd	4
No youre going to ignore the decimals so this is actually going to be 68 times 21	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	I get it	sd	1
Whats the third thing youre going to do Lisa	You place the decimal point	sd	4
Got it	Yes	b	1
First step was	My first step was to estimate so I rounded 68 up to seven and then I rounded 21 down to two and I knew seven times two is 14 and then it said to ignore the decimals so I made 68 into 68 and then I made 21 into 21 so it needs to be  as in 428 and then in order to place the decimal I put my estimate and then it was 14 so I knew that was a tenths place so I put the decimal after tenth place	sd	5
Wayne are you with us	Yes	b	1
Would it help you to make an estimate with that	No because I think it would be something like zero times zero equals zero and that wont really help you with your problem	sv	5
Wayne are you with me	Yes	b	1
Okay are you guys with me	Yes	b	1
Do you want me to do the first one with you	No yes no yes no yes	b	1
Okay if you would like some support please come up here and were going to work together	219	b	1
Remember when were estimating Missy	To 10	sd	4
Annie	Between the three and	sd	4
Im not listening to that	Yes	b	1
Yes Hunter whats your question	Can I go get my water from your desk	sd	1
Stop worrying so much about that and listen okay	Okay	b	1
Travis read aloud and proud	Six boys are supposed to run every day at recess	sd	1
Six boys are supposed to run every day at recess	By the end of the year they had to run 1926 miles	sd	1
By the end of the year they had to run 1926 miles	If they each ran the same amount of miles how far did each boy run	sd	1
Whats one thing that we know Casey	Six boys	sd	4
Trevor can you repeat what Frida just said	They have to run 1926 miles	sd	1
Do they have to run those miles	No	b	1
No	Thats what she said	sd	2
They didnt have to but they did	I heard that her say that	sd	2
Vance	Six plus	b	4
No what is the question asking us to find out	The numbers	sd	4
Number of what		b	4
What are we trying to figure out in this problem Wade	How many miles they ran	sd	4
Vance what are we trying to figure out in this problem	How many miles they ran	sd	4
Divide what	1926 by 6	sd	4
Hunter can you walk me through it	Yes	b	1
Oh my gosh	First we need to figure out all the problems weve introduced	sd	5
Why did you skip all of those and go straight to 600	Because we dont need the small problems	sd	4
Why dont we need the super small problems	Because it will take forever to complete the problem	sd	5
Because what are we trying to fit into		b	4
Keep going Hunter	Then 6 x 200  1200 and then 6 x 300  1800 and thats our question	sd	5
Thats all you did	Yes	b	1
All right now what	Now the highest we can do is 1900  1000	sd	4
Do I need to set up my problem first	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Okay now what	Then we take 300 and put it on the side of	sd	4
What is that 300 again	How much it takes to get to 1800	sd	4
How many what	Sixes	sd	4
Hunter		b	4
Now if you take that away Im sorry this is Hunters problem not mine	Now we need to take it away 0  6 is 6 2  0 is 2 9  8 is 1 and 1  1 is 0	sd	5
Now we need to take it away 0  6 is 6 2  0 is 2 9  8 is 1 and 1  1 is 0	Now we can do 6 x 10  60 so we put the 10 on the side then we put 60 below	sd	5
Now we can do 6 x 10  60 so we put the 10 on the side then we put 60 below		b	5
	Then subtraction then 6  0 is 6	sd	5
Then subtraction then 6  0 is 6	We cant do 2  6 so we tip so we go to 4	sd	5
We cant do 2  6 so we tip so we go to 4	1 is now 0 2 is now 12 and 12  6 is 6 and then 0  0 is 0	sd	5
1 is now 0 2 is now 12 and 12  6 is 6 and then 0  0 is 0	So now we can do another 10 so we put to that on the side then we put 60 and then 6  0 is 6 and 6  6 is 0	sd	5
So now we can do another 10 so we put to that on the side then we put 60 and then 6  0 is 6 and 6  6 is 0	Now we can do 6 x 1 so we put the one on the side and then we put 6 under 6 and then 6  6 is 0	sd	5
Now we can do 6 x 1 so we put the one on the side and then we put 6 under 6 and then 6  6 is 0	Now we need to add all these	sd	5
Now we need to add all these	300  10  10  1 is 321	sd	5

How many times	Three	sd	4
Albany how many times can I fit 6 into 19	Three	sd	4
Three so thats my dividing 19   6 is 3	You multiply 6 x 3 is 18 so I will subtract it	sd	5
Yes and then third subtract	Then you will get one	sd	4
Okay now	Check	sd	4
Can I fit six into one	No	b	1
Whats fourth	You bring down	sd	4
Again	Divide then youll dive 6   6	sd	4
What do I have now	6   12	b	4
All right Albany what am dividing	6   12 I will get 2	sd	5
First divide second	Multiply 6   30	sd	4
No	By	sd	3
By	By two is five	sd	4
6 x 2	No two	sd	4
6 x 2 is		b	4
12 and then subtract	You are going to get zero	sd	4
Can I fit six into zero	No	b	1
No so then	Bring down	sd	4
Can I fit six into six	Yes	b	1
Then	Then you multiply	aa	4
Then	Subtract	sd	4
6  6	Zero	sd	4
Zero	Zero	sd	2
Zero	Check	sd	4
Check	Bring down	sd	4
Do I have anything else to bring down	No	b	1
Hey do I have a remainder	No	b	1
Did I get the same answer	Yes	b	1
First thing youre going to do is in your math workbook so go ahead and get out your math workbook and turn to page 201		b	1
	200 and what	sd	1
Be there in five	What page	sd	1
Wait a minute what does that mean onehalf dozen	Half dozens	sd	1
Courtney what does that mean	A dozen means 12 and half a dozen is six because 6  6 is 12	sd	5
Courtney has that background knowledge that a dozen equals how many Courtney		b	4
If I didnt know what a one half dozen was could I figure out just by looking at the picture	Yes	b	1
Greta	He collected 151 eggs	sd	4
He collected 151 eggs	That only six eggs can fit in the carton	sd	2
Yes I would like you to	No I dont have any of these	sd	1
Penelope what were we making with arrays	Square numbers	sd	4
What is it	A factor	sd	4
So we definitely looked at a three by three array right	Yes	b	1
Are you following me	Yeah	b	1
So now ah drive me crazy	can we still write that on our paper	sd	1
Do you agree	Yes	b	1
Julia what would you do	Count them by fives	sd	4
So five times five is		b	4
Did I have to count dots	No	b	1
Did I have to count boxes	No	b	1
Okay	How I did it	sd	1
How I did it	So I just	sd	1
Or we could look at this as seven groups of five five plus five plus five plus five plus five	Or five groups of seven	sd	4
Whats five times seven		b	4
	Oh Im just close	sd	1
Oh Im just close	Im very close	sd	1
If you think Im only 20 then	Miss  youre like 30 something	sd	1

No shes probably at least	Youre 20	aa	1
Youre 20	No shes 27	sd	1
No shes 27		b	1
So lets try a different one are you ready	Okay	b	1
And be ready to share some strategies	Yeah	b	1
Julia has requested that we wait one more minute	Okay	b	1
Owen what was your strategy	I counted by two	sd	4
Why did you count by twos	Because it was  number	sd	1
Because it was  number	So I counted by twos	sd	4
Mila what did you do	Count by 10s	sd	4
Is there a right way or a wrong way	No	b	1
What answer did you get		b	4
10 20	10 20	b	1
10 20	Which ones easier	sd	3
Which ones easier	Either way you got the same answer	sd	4
Might be easier might be faster but either way thats the same answer right	Yeah	b	1
I like bananas	I like bananas too but I dont eat them	sd	1
Are you ready	Yes	b	1
Are you sure	Yes	b	1
Yes	Im sure	sd	1
No dont do that	Oh no what is she doing	sd	3
Four by six	Okay	b	1
Okay	Thats kind of easy	sd	1
Thats kind of easy	Thats kind of easy	sd	1
Julia what did you do	I did	sd	1
Ella what did you do	I counted by four	sd	4
And I saw you you were writing things down werent you	Yeah	b	1
And then you did five six seven eight		b	4
And then she counted one two three four five six groups of four is		b	4
Now I would love love love love	Okay	b	1
We are less than 22 if that helps you to look for the page	Less than 22	sd	1
Im going to put them on the board	Its 22	sd	1
Its 22	22	b	1
22	We found it	sd	1
We found it	Its just	sd	1
Its just		b	1

	I am 37 already	sd	1
	I already found it	sd	1
whats my area		b	4
	Yes	b	1
So were going to do eight of them	Yes	b	1
So I added one more group of five that gives me 40		b	1
How are we feeling	Good	ba	1
Questions	No	b	1
Thank you	What if I dont want to take it down	sd	1
I know	Jonah stop breaking  the law	sd	1
Jonah stop breaking  the law	Are you starting right now	sd	1
Were starting right now	Jonahs breaking the law	sd	1
Jonahs breaking the law	Hes still playing	sd	1
Asher	Miss	sd	1
Yeah	Im hungry	sd	1
are you ready	Yeah Im ready	sd	1
Thats why were labeling so we remember what an ordered pair is	Ms Reeves	sd	1
You remember	Ms Reeves	sd	1
Ordered pairs are always in parentheses	I remember that	sd	1
The whole thing	So wait	sd	1
So in this case	Its seven and then negative 55	sd	4
Point to B for us	This one is B and is negative eight	sd	4
Whats the ordered pair Aiden	Three and four	sd	4
D	This one and its negative 35 and 02	sd	4
Just to make you keep that in mind	B	b	4
And what would you say is that amount		b	4
Do you think that makes sense	Yeah	b	2
Go ahead	It looks like its about negative 80	sd	4
On what day		b	4
Anyone disagree or agree with what we have so far or have questions	S	b	1
S	S	b	1
Yeah	S stands for no	sd	1
Did Sarahs dot right here follow her point	11 negative 80	sd	4
So what does the point  six negative 50 tell you about the account balance	They spent something	sd	4
They spent something	They spent money on something	sd	4
They spent money on something	A lot of money	sd	2
I think this is what it means overall	Sorry I tripped on the cord	sd	1
Just go get  no big deal	This stuff came out	sd	1
This stuff came out	Do you have a broom	sd	1
Oh I dont but theyll come and vacuum tomorrow	Sorry	b	1
They did not spend 5000 on that day	They spent way more than that	sd	4
How do you know	Because it goes from 250 275 down	sd	5
Yes	Negative 50	sd	4
So how much money did they have on day five	A lot	sd	4
A lot more right		b	4
Right here we had on day five they have 275	Oh	b	1
So really were thinking okay if we		b	4
So if at six negative 50 this really just says this means on the sixth day	They spent too much money	sd	4
There was a chRiver in 32500	Thats a lot	sd	4
So if we think about someones bank account over time and Im just going to do the dots here and plot this over time and it tells the story	It goes  like a heartbeat that goes	sd	1
From 350 down to 275  how much did they spend between day three and day four	Way more than they should have	sd	4
Way more than they should have	Zero dollars	sd	4
How much is that	7500	b	4
7500	I thought you were saying	sd	1
Electricity bill	Rent	sd	4
Going from negative 50 to 100		b	4
Why would you gain 15000	A loan	sd	4
A loan	Working	sd	2
What was that	Maybe it was a paycheck	sd	4
So theyre just plateaued right there	And then they spend too much money	sd	4
Going from 100 to negative 80		b	4
	No	b	2
No		b	2
		b	2
Yes so they spent 18000 which again  could be groceries or something totally necessary	Why did I say 20	sd	3
Oh well you were thinking of the difference between 100 and 80	They spent 20	sd	4
Right here they have	Gas	b	4
Gas	A lot	sd	2
A lot	Paycheck	sd	2
Its plus 32500	It took them 14 days	sd	4
It took them 14 days	It only took them 14 days to get out of debt	sd	2
It only took them 14 days to get out of debt	It took them 14 days to move the 2500 properly	sd	2
How can we interpret absolute value of negative 50 in this  case	Zero to peak	sd	4
Zero to peak	Well that would be 130	ba	4
What does the absolute value tell us	Its 5000 below zero	sd	4
What does that mean	Its 15 below zero	sd	4
Its 15 below zero	I mean 50	sd	4
I mean 50	Thats what I said	sd	2
Thats what I said	I said it and then you said it	sd	2
I said it and then you said it	Whats that one  negative 51	sd	3
Whats that one  negative 51	Thats absolute value	sd	2
Thats absolute value	Oh	b	1
Well it has a value but the negative the absolute value of negative 50 equals 50	Im smart	sd	1
Im smart	I said it right before you	sd	1
I said it right before you	Your brain is	sd	1
If you dont have this amount of detail in your notes you need to	Ms Reeves can I take a photo	sd	1
Ms Reeves can I take a photo	Can I take a photo	sd	1
3A equals 12	Quadrant 12 minus 14	sd	4
So  that opposite operation is  14 negative and  did you get  to an answer	Where should I put your recording thing	sd	1
Did you get an answer Alexander	Yes	b	1
Yes	I already did them	sd	1
I already did them	Its 491	sd	4
So is that 2A again	2B	b	1
2B	Ms Reeves may I use the restroom	sd	1
All right then	Since the  right next to the thing whatever	sd	1
Once I see it Im like Oh yeah	Calculator	sd	1
I love that youre trying its coefficient	Oh yeah	b	1
Yeah	Well since its right next to	sd	1
Yeah	So in opposite operations it would be 64 divided by two	sd	4
You got it	And I got 32	sd	4
Nice	Can we have a cooldown	sd	1
Or of course you may do work for other classes and that type of thing	Can I see my grade on my retake	sd	1
Asher do you have that open	Yeah	b	1
Your first assessment	I realized that a little  bit later	sd	1
I think I saw that I hadnt graded yours	Mine is graded	sd	1
Also if you are done with everything I have a four quadrant mystery drawing if anybody	Ill do it	sd	1
Ill do it	I want to do it	sd	1
Yeah those are fun	Can I see this	sd	1
Its just like this and it just gives you You have to figure out what the drawing is	I love those drawings	sd	1
Yeah theyre fun  and then you can color it at the end	Can I have one of those	sd	1
Yeah	I want to try that when I get home	sd	1
Hudson you want to bring one home	Im good	sd	1
Give her some help	What does she look like	sd	1
Oh how did you do that	I fell	sd	1
Today	Yeah  today	b	1
Well take care of it	Yeah	b	1
Do you want a bandaid	Sure	b	1
Its not still actively bleeding but it would be good to cover it up just to keep it clean	What happened	sd	1
What happened	Playing catch	sd	1
Yeah and then if you dont get picked up then	Ill  just have my backpack	sd	1
Yep	We need to pass	sd	1
What	We need to pass	sd	1
Oh yeah	pass out  please	sd	1
Okay so  intention please	look at other students work to see whether  in the same way I did to solve the problem	sd	1
what was the third part of what you needed to do	casserole that group B took	sd	4
What did you notice about the picture	What I noticed is that it kind of highlighted not highlighted but	sd	4
You can  do you want to come and point at it	Sure	b	1
Anybody else want to share	I noticed that so	sd	1
Come on up you can come point at it too	So what I noticed is  equal parts and	sd	4
Uhhuh	What I noticed is they said its threefourths of what they took but theres the denominator should be 12	sd	5
What I noticed is they said its threefourths of what they took but theres the denominator should be 12	So what I think they were thinking is breaking it into these rows so thats three but then they must have thought that the leftover would be the denominator	sd	5
So what I think they were thinking is breaking it into these rows so thats three but then they must have thought that the leftover would be the denominator	So thats what I thought they were thinking	sd	5
Thank you Carson	Maybe the whole row of the pencils	sd	5
Maybe the whole row of the pencils	So I think they thought each one of them would be its own	sd	5
So I think they thought each one of them would be its own	So they thought this was fourths because it split into fourths	sd	5
So they thought this was fourths because it split into fourths	And they thought only one of them would be threefourths  said it was  twelfths but I think they messed up	sd	5
And they thought only one of them would be threefourths  said it was  twelfths but I think they messed up	They thought this was just the whole part	sd	5
They thought this was just the whole part	But this was actually the whole but they thought this row was the whole thing	sd	5
Thank you	I think  threefourths which could have been  but its right in front of  that theres 12 pieces and it could have been	sd	4
Okay	And they said  casserole	sd	4
what do you think	What I think is that it could be focusing on just the group	sv	4
Why would they just focus on that group	Because it says	sd	1
Why would they just focus on this row	Because it says how much  instead of	sd	5
Why would they just be focused on the first row Logan	I think if you focus on the first row	sd	1
Listen up	because  you dont need to worry about group A	sd	5
because  you dont need to worry about group A	You just need to worry about group B because its easier	sd	5
You just need to worry about group B because its easier	Because thats what were trying to  how much group B took	sd	5
Because thats what were trying to  how much group B took	to disagree	sd	2
Okay keep going  come on up	to the other one because I was  question and they put this in number two	sd	5
to the other one because I was  question and they put this in number two	And it says in the instructions the amount of the whole casserole	sd	5
And it says in the instructions the amount of the whole casserole	So the entire casserole means group A is portion two	sd	5
do you want me to switch to the other picture or this one	it says that the whole casserole that group B took	sd	4
it says that the whole casserole that group B took	The amount of the whole casserole that group B took	sd	4
Were just making sense of this picture and why would they use  Why would they have this threefourths here for	It says the whole casserole which means all of it	sd	5
It says the whole casserole which means all of it	So this is the instruction thats the whole casserole	sd	5
So this is the instruction thats the whole casserole	Then you find out how much that group B took out of that	sv	5
So how much group B took	So they did take these three but the only problem is their denominator right there	sd	2
Okay	Thats what were trying to understand	sd	2
Carson	I think I know why they put the fourths	sd	2
Okay come show me	I think they got confused because	sd	2
Oh you think they messed up	Yeah I think they got confused because on the description of the problem it said that group A took all of that	sd	5
Yeah I think they got confused because on the description of the problem it said that group A took all of that	So they probably just thought it was  and they could forget about it	sd	5
So group A took this	And it came	sd	1
This is gone	So I think they can just forget about it and take it out of the problem and then they had four pieces left	sd	5
So I think they can just forget about it and take it out of the problem and then they had four pieces left	So I think thats why they have fourths	sv	5
Does that make sense why they would have threefourths	Yes	b	2
So then what this threetwelfths represents can you keep running with that Carson	I think  represents all of it	sd	4
I think  represents all of it	They model  just that	sd	4
They model  just that	This doesnt connect with this	sd	4
This doesnt connect with this	This they had the right answer and then this they went and forgot about this	sd	2
What is wrong with it	I noticed that	sd	1
Do you like this picture	Yeah	b	2
What dont you like about it	The denominator	sd	2
The denominator you dont like the denominator	subtract  from the denominator	sd	2
So Logan do you have something	Yes why would you choose subtraction when you have addition and multiplication	sd	3
What do you think Anna	I dont think subtraction correlates with  used for multiplying two fractions together	sd	2
Okay	I respectfully disagree	aa	3
Okay what do you think Carson	I do agree that the number problem is incorrect but I think that the subtraction factor is correct because this is what I did	sd	2
Do you want to tell them what your	My difference is that they subtracted the leftover to get the	sd	2
What is the  representing	The  represents how much group A took	sd	4
Oh okay	Group A took eight	sd	4
Group A took eight	And then so	sd	1
So we take away the	Yeah	b	1
Whats that last onetwelfth	That would be the leftover	sd	4
Okay	But then you have those three	sd	4
But then you have those three	But I think you should actually subtract those three too and have the one be your answer because thats the leftover so that would be the remainder of it	sd	5
The question was how much	Oh yeah	b	1
Thank you	Okay yeah	b	1
what do you think	I kind of agree and disagree because I agree with what Tom said dont you have to subtract the denominator but also 12 minus eight minus onethird it doesnt equal three	sd	5
Okay	It equals one	sd	4
It equals one	So dont really see how that would equal threetwelfths	sd	4
Oh	Yeah	b	1
12 minus eight is four minus one is three	Oh I thought	sd	1
Oh I thought	Oh	b	1
Oh	I was thinking of 10	sd	4
Anna what do you think	is that the  minus onetwelfth first and thats the sum of what everyone took all together	sd	5
is that the  minus onetwelfth first and thats the sum of what everyone took all together	so if they did eleventwelfths minus eighttwelfths which is greatest	sd	5
So is this the same as the others	No	b	2
The picture also does a really  Well what do you notice about the picture	So	sd	1
Oh	And its	sd	1
Theres four what	Theres fourfourths	sd	4
What is the fourfourths what does that represent	A whole	sd	4
Because when you said twelvetwelfths is the whole casserole so fourfourths is the whole what	Because four times three equals 12	sd	5
Because four times three equals 12	And threefourths right here	sd	5
And threefourths right here	Up here its threefourths times onethird	sd	4
What do you see Caleb	I know how they got the threefourth and onethird because the	sd	4
Come show us	The length for it is  because its going three	sd	5
The length for it is  because its going three	And then theres the width is four  times threefourths and you would get threetwelfths	sd	5
So what does the onethird represent	The length of the	sd	4
Carson do you know what the onethird represents	The onethird oh actually I do not	sd	1
The onethird oh actually I do not	I was going to say that they use math strategy for their number	sd	3
What was that	It was oh I forget the name but  really recently its where you get the	sd	1
The area  for multiplying fractions	I think yeah	aa	1
whats the one third represent	I think	sv	1
I think you know	Its because right here  this way	sd	1
So what are we left talking about	Fourths	aa	4
This is zero this is onethird this is twothirds	Threethirds	sd	4
What	casserole	sd	4
casserole	Casserole the entire thing	sd	4
Theyre asking how much of the whole casserole did group B eat		b	4
What have we been working on for the last three days	Fractions	aa	4
Fractions	Algorithm	aa	2
And what way to do that	Fractions	aa	4
And whats an area model Austin	I dont know	sd	3
What area models have we used to solve a half of a fourth	Paper	sd	4
And what have we done with that paper	We folded it	sd	4
We folded it into what	Fractions	aa	4
What other way did we do it James	By timesing the denominators	sd	4
Phone a friend	The other day we had to label the tick marks	sd	4
Youre going to have to demonstrate a couple of ways today	No	b	1
No	Yay	sd	1
So notice what it says here	One of my	sd	1
One of my answers is correct	Oh no	ba	1
What	Do you even have a pet	sd	1
Do you even have a pet	You keep getting	sd	1
I know and we do not have a pet	You should	sd	1
Because we travel too much	You should get a cat	sd	1
When its a normal time my husband and I probably leave four times a year	We go on vacation a lot too so we have to have people do our lawn	sd	1
Oh I know why its doing that because its outside my coat	Hello	sd	1
First of all I need to ask Mason what is your daily affirmation today Mason	Huh	b	1
What was your daily affirmation today	It was work hard and smile more	sd	1
Did you work hard to try and solve this problem	No	b	1
If youre working hard youre not doing bad selftalk are you	No	b	1
Im going to do it one more round and I want you to use your resources change your attitude as I know that if youve got positive attitude what are you doing underneath that mask	Smiling	sd	1
Can you explain what happened	Well Im not sure	sd	3
Well Im not sure	He kind of got it but he did say I have a six in front	sd	2
Round to the nearest tenth whats my number going to be	61	b	4
And if I round to the nearest hundredth	61 or 14 hundredths	sd	4
Does that make sense	Your microphone is	sd	1
My microphone is wonky because Ive got this thing on too	Youve got two microphones	sd	1
Okay do that make sense	Yes	b	1
Okay were going to try it one more time	Can we erase	sd	1
All right	Im sorry	sd	1
What happened with you and your partner	So we got different answers but for the first part we got the first one right	sd	2
So we got different answers but for the first part we got the first one right	The second one we didnt agree on	sd	2
The second one we didnt agree on	I did five tenths and then he did six tenths	sd	2
Can you explain that to Connor	Because the one before the eight Five	sd	5
Because the one before the eight Five	You go back to look if the one is above five	sd	5
What one	If its higher or more raise the score	sd	4
What one	The eight	sd	4
Because its to the	Nearest tenth	sd	4
So what would this be Dan	It would be six tenths	sd	4
Okay explain to me what happened here	So on the first one we agreed and got one	sd	2
So on the first one we agreed and got one	On the second one I got 06 he got 6	sd	2
On the second one I got 06 he got 6	On the last one I got 059 and he got 09	sd	2
What did you actually do	I rounded	sd	4
So you rounded the eight to a nine because of the six but what did you forget	To leave the five	sd	4
Is that what you did Mason	He got 09 or 009 he just didnt put the five	sd	2
Okay yes Maam	I have a question	sd	3
I have a question	What would you rather us do it	sd	3
What would you rather us do it	Would you rather us do 06 or just 6	sd	3
I would like you to do zero point	Okay	b	1
Turn to math journal page		b	1
Do not do not do not do not do anything yet	We already did seven	sd	1
We already did seven	Its 179	sd	1
Its 179	Oh Im so good	sd	1
Oh Im so good	Yeah we already did 177	sd	1
I think Im on the wrong math lesson	Its 179	sd	1
Just a second	Oh yeah its 179	aa	1
Oh yeah its 179	Yeah Im always right	sd	1
Why did you do 177	Its 58 were on 59 I think	sd	1
Im on 59 in my book	Is this 177	sd	1
What is your 177	Its 58	sd	1
Its 58	58	b	1
Okay so my math thing is cray cray	Or our books are cray cray	sd	1
59	That is odd	sd	1
That is odd	Thats so weird	sd	1
Thats okay Ill give you a piece of paper	Whats up	sd	1
Whats up	My names	sd	1
So they added something and didnt give us new Ts editions is what they did	We dont need these	sd	1
Not yet	Thank you	aa	1
And Im going to ask Austin to start	Hello	sd	1
First of all what problem are we solving	So were solving that that that that that	sd	4
Is that plus or times	Are you judging me	qy	1
Are you judging me	Yes I said	sd	1
Yes I said	Okay so first weve got to split it into four	sd	4
Okay so first weve got to split it into four	Split these into fours	sd	4
So what way are you going to split it into fourths what way would you like to split it into fourths	This way	aa	4
Okay so split it into fourths that way	With the who	sd	1
With the who	Split it into fourths	sd	4
Split it into fourths	Yeah but which way	sd	3
Choose someone to go next	Thats what I said	sd	1
Thats what I said	That is not what you said	sd	1
Did they miss a step	You need to color in three	sd	4
You need to color in three	You have to shade two fourths	sd	4
Okay	And then we have to shade in two of those	sd	4
And then we have to shade in two of those	And the answer is six ninths no six twelfths	sd	4
And the answer is six ninths no six twelfths	Yeah six twelfths	b	2
Yeah six twelfths	But we have to	sd	1
Now answer the question	Does that make sense where I did that	sd	1
Using the boxes	Do you just put these in the corner	sd	1
Do you just put these in the corner	Yeah	b	2
How many total boxes do we have there Austin	And then after that we can label them	sd	1
And then after that we can label them		b	4
Im not sure what youre doing	What do we do when were done	sd	1
Stand up	Stand up	sd	1
Stand up	Is that right	aa	1
Yep Im just looking to see if anybody did it differently	A little bit of PTSD	sd	1
A little bit of PTSD	Yes thats perfect	ba	1
Because she asked that question Im going to ask you to share	Do you know what PTSD stands for	sd	1
Do you know what PTSD stands for	No its not	sd	1
Why did you put three fourths down here and two thirds up here	What	ba	1
What	You got more than me	sd	1
No you did not do it backwards	I did it backward	sd	1
I would like Mr Connor to come up here and model what he and Miss Alyssa talked about and did	Okay so what we did was we did the tick marks and then	sd	5
Okay so what we did was we did the tick marks and then	And then after that we shaded in those	sd	5
And then after that we shaded in those	We forgot to label	sd	2
We forgot to label	And then after that we were	sd	2
And then after that we were	And then we saw that six twelfths was how much	sd	2
Miss Julia do you agree or disagree with what they did	I disagree with what they did	sd	2
How come	Because they worked the problem backwards	sd	5
Because they worked the problem backwards	They did the y coordinate first	sd	5
So your first fraction is always what coordinate	Y	b	4
Your second one is the x	Oh wait no your first ones the x because the x	sd	4
Because I wrote his name down the day we were wiping desks and he wasnt even one of my friends wiping desks	No he wrote it down because he wanted to tease it	sd	1
Okay here we go	Can I be there	sd	1
Yeah go ahead be up there together	So what me and Zach did was first we drew the fourth	sd	4
So what me and Zach did was first we drew the fourth	You can kind of see in there	sd	2
You can kind of see in there	In four and then we colored in three of them because its three fourths	sd	5
In four and then we colored in three of them because its three fourths	And then we colored in the third this way and then we colored in two thirds	sd	5
And then we colored in the third this way and then we colored in two thirds	And then the amount of them that were double shaded were three fourths	sd	5
Was my problem two thirds times three fourths or was my problem three fourths times two thirds	We just changed that because of what we were saying	sd	4
Yeah so youve got to make sure youre doing x and y	So we should have had the third going that way	sd	4
It was three fourths should have been on the x coordinate and the two thirds should have been on the y coordinate	Isnt that what we did	sd	4
Isnt that what we did	No	b	2
No	No x is on the bottom one	sd	2
Because you have the thirds on the bottom and the fourths on the side	Oh	b	1
Is it ever going to change the outcome of the answer	No	b	1
Where are you going to end up	In the wrong place	sd	4
Make sense	Yes	b	1
And friends on 180 it is going to ask you to	Ouch	aa	1
Ouch	What is happening to my leg	sd	1
What is happening to my leg	180	b	1
I want you to make sure whats the easiest one that youre going to write about	Multiply the denominator to the numerator	sd	4
I want you to pick another one and demonstrate it on your other paper	Do you want us to just do all of them	sd	1
And I want you to pick one of those to do on the paper	Wait how many of these	sd	1
Wait how many of these	The second one	sd	1
You know what a sage and scribe is right	Yes	b	1
Any questions	So on math boxes for example if I was odds and he was evens then I would only have one three and five written on mine and he would only have two and four	sd	4
Yes	Can I have a pencil	sd	1
Of course you may have a pencil	Do you need a sharpener	sd	1
Do you need a sharpener	I have a sharpener	sd	1
I have a sharpener	I have	sd	1
Oh what size led do you need	Normal	b	1
Normal	I dont know normal	sd	1
I dont know normal	07	b	1
Is it seven or five	I dont know were about to find out	sd	1
It should be written right here	Oh I didnt see this	sd	1
Alyssa thank you for sharing	In your own words first	sd	1
In your own words first	Okay	b	1
Explain how you do those	You got games on your phone	sd	1
You got games on your phone	You got games on your phone	sd	1
You got games on your phone	So what do you do	qy	1
So what do you do	One method we discussed in class	sd	1
One method we discussed in class	One method we discussed in class was	sd	1
Explain that to me	With folding paper	sd	4
Tell me what weve learned in the last couple of days	Okay so then after youve solved these we have to pick two of them and do it on this paper	sd	4
So what did I say to the class when I allowed them to use that demonstration	So we pick two of these we do one here and then we do one here	sd	4
So what did Abi say was the easiest strategy	We have to solve all of these ones up here	sd	4
Perfect and then what was my response on what I wanted you to do for number one	Thats a lot of things	sv	1
Thats a lot of things	Lets change it	sd	1
Can you tell me what you wrote for number one	I said For example  three sixth you multiply the denominator two times six equal 12 then you  numerators one times three equals three and then	sd	5
What did you write	First what we do is multiply the denominator with the two fractions and then do the same with the numerator or you could do it with an area thing	sd	5
Can I have your attention for just a minute	What	ba	1
I already asked James this question so Im going to ask someone else this question	Yeah	b	1
Did you complete number one	What do you mean	qy	1
Did you guys write something down for number one on journal page 178	We did	sd	1
We did	Oh we are right now	sd	1
Oh we are right now	Its 79	sd	1
Can I ask what you are writing	Yes we are writing for the method for multiplying fractions discovered in class and were writing about paper folding	sd	4
About the what	About the folding method	sd	4
Go ahead Izzy	Because everybody knows how to do that and you want us to be able to understand how to do the other methods	sd	5
Did I give specific instructions not to use that method on your paper or you could write it but there had to be an explanation of another	Yes	b	1
Were those my instructions	Yes	b	1
I needed that so good job thank you	So we would fold our papers into sixths	sd	4
So we would fold our papers into sixths	The first fraction	sd	2
The first fraction	The other way	sd	2
The other way	First fraction denominator	sd	2
First fraction denominator	I want to do it	sd	1
How you doing friend	Good	ba	1
Good	Its the answer	sd	1
If when you get ready to do  and you only have to model one here and one here how are you going to solve the other one	Lets do two twelfths on this one	sd	4
But if Ive only asked you to model two doing area model how could you do the rest	Multiplying them	sd	4
You get to pick one and then you do that and youre going to sage and scribe these two yes	Wait you pick one of those three	sd	1
Youre going to solve all three of them	Oh	b	1
But then youre only going to model one of them over here	Oh	b	1
Okay	Im going to circle the ones at the bottom	sd	1
Im going to circle the ones at the bottom	Okay now we have to explain this	sd	1
Im going to ask you the same thing	So they kind of challenge you	sd	4
Why do you think thats going to challenge you	Because its big numbers	sd	5
Okay so you have to break it into bigger pieces	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No thats too hard	sv	1
You did not explain how this shows your thinking	Oh I chose that one that we could write	sd	1
Oh I chose that one that we could write	There you go	sd	1
There you go	Okay now what shall we do next	sd	3
Okay now what shall we do next	What do you think we should do next	sv	3
What do you think we should do next	After we solve it	sd	2
After we solve it	And what do we shade it into	sd	3
And what do we shade it into	Whats the six that we have to shade to	sd	3
Whats the six that we have to shade to	Oh	b	1
Oh	And then what do we have to do next	sd	3
He just asked you a question	Its from one half to three sixth	sd	4
Its from one half to three sixth	Does that make sense	sd	2
Does that make sense	Yeah yeah	b	1
Yeah yeah	Does that make sense	sd	2
Okay	My hand is getting all	sd	1
Oh would you do StMaP for me	Yeah	b	1
Play StMaP	We need help	sd	3
We need help	This one is subtraction and  common denominator is that the right thing to do	sd	4
Yeah	We werent sure if	sd	1
We werent sure if	So we picked this one to shade all this in but how would we do that	sd	3
You will have to use a different model	Well then we will pick a different one	sd	1
Remember how Do you have a whiteboard that I can show you	I do and I have it ready right here	sd	1
Tell me what the problem is	It is three fourths minus one	sd	1
Three fourths minus one third	Yeah	b	1
What tool would I have to use	Fraction circle	sd	4
And Im going to try and solve that with a box	Okay	b	1
That was three fourths times	What about if we do number 10	sd	1
What about if we do number 10	Because then we can find the area	sd	5
Because then we can find the area	Thats what weve been doing	sd	2
Thats what weve been doing	Really	aa	2
Really	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	The area	sd	2
The area	Its six fifteenths	sd	2
Its six fifteenths	She said to do it	sd	1
Yes in just a minute	Weve got to do number 10	sd	1
You can put on Mozart if you would like	Your labeling is fine just fix your tick marks	sd	1
Its not working	Is the other thing on the bottom supposed to be on	sd	1
Everybody read the learning target with me at the top	I can use strategy solver for me pictures number models to review fraction problems	sd	1
I know I am successful when Paulina	I explain my thinking to my team	sd	1
I explain my thinking to my team	I have followed the procedures of the showdown instructor	sd	1
Flip over on top card and read the problem	One in	sd	1
Oh	Showdown	aa	1
Well thats not really explaining is it	No	b	1
Were going to do a trial Yes	Can a captain use a circle this is just in case anybody	sd	1
Standley	If we dont know what to say if we disagree should we get the math bookmarks out	sd	1
The what	Those math bookmarks	sd	1
Five four	Three two one	sd	1
Okay tell me one thing an architect needs to consider when theyre building a gingerbread house Maddy	How many materials they need	sd	4
Materials and maybe quantity of materials how much	How much they cost	sd	4
Yes the cost of materials	Material	sd	1
Sarah	Measurement	sd	4
Carrie	How much of each thing they need how long maybe	sd	4
How long what needs to be	The materials theyre building with	sd	4
Who can add on to that Maria	How long or wide the gingerbread needs to be	sd	4
How long or wide the gingerbread needs to beMia	Area	sd	4
Danielle	I think that the architect would need to consider the area because if you dont consider the area you might have a nonequal house or it might be lopsided or something	sd	5
Sarah I see youve got a burning idea	Also with area you want to know the area because if your house is too big it could hit other buildings and then it would be bad	sd	5
You would want to think almost about city planning	What about perimeter	sd	4
Do you think we need to consider perimeter as well	Yes	b	1
What about another measurement of space	The amount of inches and how wide and how high it should be	sd	4
The amount of inches and how wide and how high it should be	Basically volume	sd	4
You learned about this at the very very beginning of the year	I know how to do it	sd	1
You dont know what Im going to ask	is talking to me about volume here	sd	1
Ivy can you add to that	Width and height	sd	4
Width and height	Volume	sd	2
Volume	Volume	sd	2
Volume	Volume	sd	2
Width and height	Miss volume	sd	4
Tell me more about what you mean when you say timesing it out length width and height	Timesing I used	sd	4
Timesing I used	It means youre measuring the inside of a threedimensional shape	sd	4
Carrie	How much of something between sides but if you do the thing that means timesing the length width and height	sd	5
How much of something between sides but if you do the thing that means timesing the length width and height	If you had eight for the height you would times it by the width lets say the width is five	sd	5
If you had eight for the height you would times it by the width lets say the width is five	Then you do it again by the height and length	sd	5
Maddy	Weve gotten the little cubes and then put them inside of the whole	sd	4
Yes weve used cubes to measure volume	Weve also used multiplication to help us measure volume by measuring how tall it is and how long it is and the width of it because then wed multiply them together to get the volume	sd	5
Okay Sarah	Rulers because yardsticks would be too long but a ruler would be a good size to figure out the size if you want squares and they would help	sd	5
Okay	Depends on the size of it	sd	4
Depends on the size of it	You could use a meter stick for any of those things	sd	4
Could you use	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
Why not	Because gummy sharks theyre not really straight	sd	5
Because gummy sharks theyre not really straight	When youre building you want things to be straight so theyre not weird or lopsided and gummy sharks theyre straight and theyre also a little bit harder since theyre not necessarily flat and that could be harder and theyre very small	sd	5
Danielle what do you say about gummy sharks	I disagree with Sarah because if you use the gummy sharks for the length and width you could just like This is how many gummy sharks how long it is or how tall it is	sd	2
Danielle argues that you could use gummy sharks to measure the volume	I disagree with Danielle because if you want to try and measure the volume and fill it up with gummy sharks and try and measure that	sd	2
I disagree with Danielle because if you want to try and measure the volume and fill it up with gummy sharks and try and measure that	Gummy sharks aint squared and the same on both sides all the sides	sd	4
Okay Im going to give you some other options could you measure the volume of the gingerbread house with mini marshmallows	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Luis what do you think	Yes I guess	sd	1
You guess	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Tell me a little bit more about that	Because I dont know	sd	1
All right	I think you can because the little marshmallows are kind of like a seven unit so you can say If you measure with four you can say its four seven units long	sd	5
Yes	I disagree because you need a solid thing to measure because those can easily be squished and then the house will be messed up	sd	2
Okay another important consideration I havent thought about before	If theres gaps in the  they might be smaller	sd	5
Why Smarties	Theyre more close to a square	sd	4
You dont know	and theyre probably going to be the most accurate	sd	4
Is that the shark	Yes	b	1
Yes	They get so weird	sd	1
What unit would you choose and why Adrian	I would choose the mini sharks because theyre long and it might be easier to play with it	sd	5
What did you say Maria	I chose Smarties because its a solid candy and it wont For the marshmallows if you squish them together its not going to be the measurement  four centimetres	sd	5
I chose Smarties because its a solid candy and it wont For the marshmallows if you squish them together its not going to be the measurement  four centimetres	If you squish them its not going to be the same measurement	sd	5
Can you share what you told me about the Smarties	No	b	1
Mia do you remember what he said	They stack easily	sd	4
This afternoon when you are building with your group or partners and then you have an opportunity to measure your house think about what weve talked about and what you might consider when youre choosing the material to measure your house with	because you did everything	sd	1
because you did everything	Youre finding two thirds of two thirds	sd	4
Youre finding two thirds of two thirds	I did	sd	2
I did	We did something like this yesterday	sd	4
We did something like this yesterday	I didnt of two thirds	sd	2
I didnt of two thirds	I didnt figure out how to make	sd	2
I didnt figure out how to make	Uhoh	b	1
Uhoh	She	sd	1
She	No	b	1
No	out of	sd	1
out of	How do I make into a fourth	sd	3
How do I make into a fourth	I made into a half	sd	2
I made into a half	Huh	b	1
Huh	A third	sd	2
A third	You have to make it into two thirds	sd	2
You have to make it into two thirds	do that	sd	1
do that	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	do that	sd	1
do that	Caleb	aa	1
Caleb	Caleb	aa	1
Caleb	Caleb	aa	1
Caleb	Caleb	aa	1
Caleb	Im just saying	sd	1
Im just saying	On what	sd	1
On what	On what	sd	1
On what	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	I know	aa	1
I know	Its this	sd	1
Its this	No you do	sv	1
No you do	No	b	1
No	Its down this way	sd	1
Its down this way	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	This right here	aa	1
This right here	It might not be exact thirds but	sd	4
It might not be exact thirds but	Its okay	sd	1
Its okay	There you go	sd	1
There you go	Yes	b	1
Yes	All right	aa	1
All right	I just did it	sd	1
I just did it	I just didnt look	sd	1
I just didnt look	Good job Caleb	sd	1
Good job Caleb	Thats my pencil	sd	1
Two thirds so that means there needs to be how many parts	Three	sd	4
Three	Three	sd	2
So the instructions are fold and shade a piece of paper so youre folding and shading	I know	aa	1
I know	I know two thirds	sd	1
I know two thirds	fourth ninths	sd	4
fourth ninths	Is it four ninths	sd	4
Is this your pencil	Whose pencil is this	sd	1
Whose pencil is this	I found it in my desk	sd	1
Im sorry	is this your pencil	sd	1
is this your pencil	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
No	We have no	sd	1
We have no	Do you know whose pencil that is	sv	1
Do you know whose pencil that is	No	b	1
No	Its not my pencil	sd	1
Its not my pencil	No	b	1
No	Im good	sd	1
Im good	Dude seriously	sd	1
Dude seriously	No	b	1
No	I want to win	sd	1
I want to win	This is my pencil	sd	1
This is my pencil	This is not my pencil	sd	1
So did anybody get the answer	They dont know	sd	1
They dont know	four sixes	sd	4
four sixes	Its four tenths	sd	2
Its four tenths	Its four tenths	sd	2
Its four tenths	Its four tenths	sd	2
Anna what did you get	Four ninths	sd	4
Two thirds of two thirds is four ninths and tell me what you did to get that	Well I multiplied four and	sd	4
You multiplied	Yeah	b	1
Okay	And I  and then with the denominator I put 33 again	sd	4
So did you do the folding part	Yes	b	1
So first you folded counting right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	1
So the first step Landon would be what	So folding it into thirds	sd	4
So we fold that way into thirds and we want two thirds of two thirds so what am I going to shade here	Two in thirds	sd	4
What am I going to shade	Two thirds of it	sd	4
Yall see that	Yeah	b	1
So what is the whole	two thirds	sd	4
The whole is two thirds	Three thirds	sd	4
Three thirds	I said three thirds	sd	2
So then what did you do after that Joey	I did it to the side	sd	4
You pulled it into the other direction	Yeah	b	1
And then what did you do after that to find two thirds of two thirds	I shaded	sd	4
So it would be this and this	Yes	b	1
Should we	I dont have it	sd	3
Talk to your partners	multiply it but I think its	sv	4
Or is the product greater or less than the factors	Its greater	sv	4
Its greater than	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Two thirds or four ninths	Two thirds	sd	4
Why does it makes sense that two thirds of two thirds would be less than two thirds	I know how to solve it	sd	1
Are you guys ready	Yeah	b	1
Why does it make sense that the product of two thirds of two thirds would be less than the factor of two thirds	Because the area	sd	1
Caleb	I think	sv	1
I think	I thought four ninths was smaller than two thirds because for two thirds to get a whole its just one more one third away from getting one whole	sd	5
I thought four ninths was smaller than two thirds because for two thirds to get a whole its just one more one third away from getting one whole	And then four ninths would 608 we know	sd	5
Kevin	I agree with Caleb because one third and now also youre doubling a numerator so that is four thirds then also you have triple the denominator so that might be why you are	sv	5
Why the product is smaller	Yeah	b	1
Kevin do you have a different explanation	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So paper to show	sd	1
Stand in front	Okay	b	1
Okay	this is two thirds as a whole and two thirds of this so I can and this is a whole and then I take two thirds of that	sd	5
this is two thirds as a whole and two thirds of this so I can and this is a whole and then I take two thirds of that	Its two thirds of two thirds	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Landon do you have something to ask him	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Can I go up and show	sd	1
And so when you listen to others short of making you repeat it I could make you repeat it but I think if you really pay attention and make sure you understand what theyre saying then you will be able to explain it as well	So the answer if four ninths which is this but we have the thirds so the two thirds goes all the way down here and then the other two thirds goes out here	sd	5
So the answer if four ninths which is this but we have the thirds so the two thirds goes all the way down here and then the other two thirds goes out here	It goes out onto the thirds two thirds	sd	5
It goes out onto the thirds two thirds	So theyre bigger than each other	sd	5
So theyre bigger than each other	Well not bigger the two thirds extends out more than our answer each way	sd	5
Well not bigger the two thirds extends out more than our answer each way	It extends out four ninths more	sd	5
It extends out four ninths more	And then plus if that one the answer here this one goes out here and then this one goes out here	sd	5
And then plus if that one the answer here this one goes out here and then this one goes out here	So its four ninths larger than our answer	sv	5
So its four ninths larger than our answer	Because its the two thirds	sd	5
Because its the two thirds	Its hard to explain	sd	1
Liam or Im sorry Hunter did you have another explanation	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	explanation is	sd	1
explanation is	Even though were multiplying its still thinking only being on	sd	4
Exactly	But say you have 10  you have 10 ones if you would take one over two of that then youd get five 15 because youre getting only a fraction of	sv	5
But say you have 10  you have 10 ones if you would take one over two of that then youd get five 15 because youre getting only a fraction of	So even if its and youre getting only two thirds of that because its not all in the two thirds	sd	5
So the dimensions would be how long each side is	Three by three	sd	4
I think its one because one times one equals what	I think its one because length times width	sd	5
I think its one because length times width	Then look one two three four five six seven eight nine	sd	5
Then look one two three four five six seven eight nine	And because you go down to three three three three three it comes back	sd	5
And because you go down to three three three three three it comes back	Three six nine	sd	5
Three six nine	Three times three is nine	sd	5
Three times three is nine	Three six nine one two three four five six three ways to show it	sd	5
Three six nine one two three four five six three ways to show it	Three six seven eight	sd	5
Why do you have to talk to me that way Colin	I just said one	sd	4
What	I just said	sd	1
Matt	Me and Jace thought that the area was nine	sd	2
Mia	The area is one	sd	4
And how do you know	Because one times one is one	sd	5
Is everybody with me	Yep	b	1
Joey	Its two by two	sd	4
Two by two	Yeah	b	1
This whole thing is one	Thats	ba	1
This whole length of the line is what	Two thirds of it	sd	4
Did you guys all write that down	Yep	b	1
So multiplication for the area of the shaded rectangle would be what	Basically nothing	sd	1
Peyton	Probably two thirds times two thirds	sd	4
So there are one two three four so what fraction does each of these represent	Fourths	aa	4
And what would this be	One fourth	sd	4
One fourth	Two fourths	sd	4
Two fourths	Three fourths	sd	4
Three fourths	A whole	sd	4
So the dimensions would be one fourth by what did you say	Two fourths	sd	4
So then whats the area	Three 16ths	sd	4
Because there are how many pieces total	16	b	4
16 so those are 16ths	And then	sd	1
And then one fourth times three fourths	Is	b	1
So the multiplication numbers  so this would be one fourth times	Three fourths	sd	4
Three fourths	Equals	b	1
It didnt like me doing that turning it on and then turning it off	Yeah it follows you around	sd	1
Yeah it follows you around	It follows the necklace	sd	1

Did everyone put 96	Yeah	b	2
So what did you put for the divisor	Three	sd	4
What was the quotient	32	b	4
Does everyone agree with that	Yes	b	2
So in order to get the largest quotient Harriet should make the largest dividend and the smallest divisor	Wait was this a three	sd	1
I would say this is a three	How come	b	3
They explained their thinking and they explain their mathematical reasoning	But why just a three	sd	3
Because they explain one way to solve	then	sd	1

How many of you guys play or have watched a baseball game	inauidble	sd	1
inauidble	I played baseball	sd	1
I played baseball	Ive watched it	sd	1
But in the baseball game do you go up against your own team members	No	b	1
No	Only scrimage	sd	1
are the numbers in my 624 ever going to go up against each other	No	b	1
No	No	b	2
No they are on the same team	Do I write that down on my monster	sd	1
Do I write that down on my monster	I	b	1
But were going to talk more about that is just kind of a visualization of why were not doing 600 times 2600 times four because these numbers are on the same team	Okay	b	1
So here is place oh Alexander go ahead	could you make the body	sd	4
In my math monster	The next step is to make you already have a body	sd	4
The next step is to make you already have a body	So you already have an arm right	sd	4
Oh do we	actually no	sd	1
actually no	the next step after the body is the arm	sd	4
the next step after the body is the arm	If you dont have the arm then you cant do 124 times eight is and 600 times 8 20 times eight and four times eight	sd	5
Exactly	All of those	sd	1
Alright go ahead and mute please	I did make my monster have the biggest arm ever so I can fit all of them in	sd	1
How am I going to do 600 times eight	Going six times 8	sd	4
And what is six times eight	Six times a is	sd	1
Anybody what is six times 8	42	b	4
Well thats really close		b	4
		b	2
		b	4
If we dont our multiplication facts	And you have to make them count your zeros	sd	4
Now what about 20 times 8	20 times eight is 16	sd	5
20 times eight is 16	And you have to count your zero so 160	sv	5
And last but not least Matteo what is four times eight	24	b	4
24	s	b	1
Are you sure	no	b	1
So four times eight be		b	4
And zero plus zero plus two is what class	zero plus zero is two	sd	5
8 plus 1		b	4
Im not going to give you longer than one minute because we should be copying this down already	T	b	1
Yes Keily	When are we going to go over the answer of the of what was your mistake on the one photo	sd	1
is my head there	kind of	sd	1
Do We have a question	I have a question	sd	3
Okay	Um my question is how do you come up with the number like two times one equals	sd	3
Does that make sense or no	Yeah that makes sense	sd	1
Alexander	I dont understand how you got like the body equations	sd	3
So 80 times 6 and nine times 6	That makes sense now	sd	1
Any other questions about where or how Ive gotten where I am	My question is are my sums correct	sd	1
Are what correct	My sums I got for eight times six	sd	1
Matteo can you tell me what your answer is and how you got it	I got 480 Because I did eight times six which equaled 80 and then just added zero	sd	5
You mean equals 48	Yeah	b	1
Nine times six is what Margo	9 times 6 is 54	sd	5
Okay so nine times six equals 54	T I have a question	sd	3
Yeah	Like is it doesnt matter which order you do it	sd	4
Like is it doesnt matter which order you do it	can you like do like six and then you like find Nine	sd	4
So the next step would be to do the leg which is just 480 plus 54	isnt an arm	sd	4
So the arm was our answers right here	Oh ok	ba	1
If I try to add these lined up like this is this gonna give me the answer	No	aa	1
But is that is that a very different answer from my 534	Yeah	b	1
What year was I born	Youll be 60 years old	sd	4
1960 1971 1980 2012 81 remainder one nine remainder 16 11600 18005 14965	Is that even a year	sd	1
What are you thinking	I think its 1940 though because my grandpa 60 so I just took 20 away and its 1940	sd	5
What do we think when we see those answers	For the 81 with a remainder of one and the nine with a remainder of 16 I dont really think that makes sense	sd	4
Why doesnt it make sense to have a remainder	Thats not really a year	sd	4
And this would say that I was born in the year nine	9 what	ba	3
9 what	Dinosaurs	sd	1
Dinosaurs	We were not alive at that point	sd	1
What else do you notice	I figured out that	sd	1
No I wantWhat do you notice about the numbers up there	Well the last three are way far in the future so you cant be born in the future if youre here right now	sd	4
What year is it		b	4
		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
Oh my gosh	Well be dead at that point	sd	1
This is way way way in the future	Probably flying cars	aa	1
Probably flying cars	Unless you time traveled	sd	1
I mean I guess we could have traveled back in time but these seem kind of unrealistic right	so big that the earth would be	sd	1
And we usually dont write years with remainders	Thats just weird	sd	1
Is that fact	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
One day every year I get to celebrate my birthday	Same	sd	1
Does this number have anything to do with my problem	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
If you used this number in figuring out your solution it has nothing to do with	You have to use the 41 because its basically saying how many days until your birthday	sd	5
No	Its just saying how much days are in a year	sd	4
Im 41 years old	Are you actually	sd	1
I obviously this right	Also the year were in right now	sd	4
What	The year were in right now	sd	4
What does that have to do with anything	Because thats the year that were actually in	sd	5
So what year are we in		b	4
		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
So that wasnt in the problem but you guys tell me I need that	Then you can just minus 21 and then 2000 year 20 and then if you minus 20 you get 19	sd	5
Julia	Because its the year were in now and if you subtract it you can get to places you want for the year	sd	5
So if I take the year now and subtract the number of years Ive been alive that will tell me when I was born	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah thats what I did	sd	2
Yeah thats what I did	And besides that sort of states taking away	sd	2
So the year I was born plus 41 is going to give me		b	4

Does 2012 makes sense	No	b	1
No	No because then you would be 8	sd	5

No youd be nine	No youd be nine this year	sv	2
was born in 2012	My little cousin was	sd	1
Again one of those questions T was born in 2012	Youd be nine	sd	4
Okay	Because youre 41	sd	5
Because youre 41	1940 is too You would be too old	sd	2
If I was born in 1940 how old would I be	60	b	4
60		b	2

And now I can take from here to turn this into		b	4
	12	b	2
Whats 12 minus four		b	4

	I got the answer	sd	1
I got the answer	I knew it	sd	1
So yeah I was born in 1980	My mom was born in 1980	sd	1
Youre picking out numbers and youre just doing it	You have to think about the subtraction and actually the addition	sd	4
Those are all connected	T	b	1
but theyre not relevant to what you were asked to solve	I think the reason why they have a remainder and why it could be weird it was because some people thought it was division	sd	5
They put them in there to trick you	Theres	sd	1
Theres	I didnt know the answer but I did solve	sd	3
Yes	Now I kind of get why I got 11600 because I calculated how many days youve been alive	sd	5
Carrie what do you know	Im pretty sure that rays you kind of draw lines and you could also use rays to multiply	sd	4
But yeah okay good connection	Its kind of like geometry	sd	4
What else do you know	Rays helps when youre doing multiple	sd	4
Can you come up and put your journal under here and share what you did	I had a circle and I did eight eighths	sd	5
I had a circle and I did eight eighths	I thought it would be faster so I did one eighth times eight would equal eight eighths or one	sd	5
Harold what did he do	He did the same thing as me which is use the multiplication times tables	sd	2
Oh wow	I did tenths	sd	4
Explain your equation here on the bottom	I did one tenth times 10 because if you did one tenth that would be 10 and I got 10 tenths or one	sd	5
Marylin come on up	For mine I did fourths and I did one fourth plus one fourth plus one fourth plus one fourth equals four fourths or one	sd	5
She has her addition equation and Marylin what would be the multiplication equation	one fourth times four equals four fourths or one	sd	5
Its really good	I did eighths and I went four eighths plus four eighths equals eight eighths	sd	5
Does that seem fair	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
If youre not the oldest does it seem fair	No	b	1
In royal families is it always fair	Nope	sd	1

What did you do at first and then how did you revise your thinking	What I did at first was I divided it like this and gave the half to the oldest daughter and then I divided this into thirds and gave one third to one daughter and another third to another daughter	sd	5
What I did at first was I divided it like this and gave the half to the oldest daughter and then I divided this into thirds and gave one third to one daughter and another third to another daughter	Then I said Queen Arlene gets a third of the land	sd	5
Then I said Queen Arlene gets a third of the land	Then I realized that the queen right here decided to keep the land so I knew that Queen Arlene didnt really want the land in this question	sd	5
Then I realized that the queen right here decided to keep the land so I knew that Queen Arlene didnt really want the land in this question	Then I realized that the oldest daughter still got half but then if the queen wouldnt want a third of this land I erased the third and divided the half in half to get each of the youngest daughters gets one fourth	sd	5
One half plus one fourth plus one fourth does it equal one	Yeah	b	1
Can you read your explanation Ray	No Queen Arlene cant do it because if you divide the rectangle into two halves and then divide one half into another two halves that would equal two fourths or one half and then give the youngest two daughters one fourth and give the oldest daughter the other half then Queen Arlene to give all the daughters a piece of land and also the youngest two daughters would get one fourth not one third of the land	sd	5
Grant can you come up and share	I thought it was no in the beginning	sd	5
I thought it was no in the beginning	I divided two sisters first and then I drew a half over here to show that it would not work because theres not enough to put a half there	sd	5
I divided two sisters first and then I drew a half over here to show that it would not work because theres not enough to put a half there	Thats basically what it says in my words here	sd	1
How did you get your answer then	I got my answer for no or for the second one	sd	1
For the first one	I got my answer by pretty much looking at it and seeing that one half is not equal to one third	sd	4
Rory would you come up and share what you got for number two	For number two I also on the diagram since I know shes keeping one half of her land that means the whole is going to be one half	sd	5
For number two I also on the diagram since I know shes keeping one half of her land that means the whole is going to be one half	This I said was one half and out of that one half she would get two eighths the youngest sister would get two eighths two eighths and then the youngest sister would get four eighths	sd	5
This I said was one half and out of that one half she would get two eighths the youngest sister would get two eighths two eighths and then the youngest sister would get four eighths	If you had the one two sixteenths two sixteenths and four sixteenths	sd	5
What does that mean	No I was just doing that so that you would see that this is a half	sd	4
Well if you basically put the two eighths plus two eighths together how much is that	Four sixteenths	sd	4
Its actually four eighths and four eighths is really what	Four eighths is really	sd	1
Four eighths is really	I dont know	sd	3
Its a half	Its a half	sd	1
Heres his equation at the bottom but instead of two sixteenths plus two sixteenths plus four sixteenths what are you going to change that to	One half or the eight sixteenths	sd	4
Marie can you come up and share what you had	Okay	b	1
Okay	I started by the queen has one half and so I started by before I did the one fourth and that one eighth I did the oldest one would get two thirds and the younger sisters would each get one sixth	sd	5
I started by the queen has one half and so I started by before I did the one fourth and that one eighth I did the oldest one would get two thirds and the younger sisters would each get one sixth	I did one sixth plus one sixth was one third and one third plus one third equals one but I figured out that this is only half of the land so then I changed it to one fourth and one eighth and one eighth	sd	5
I did one sixth plus one sixth was one third and one third plus one third equals one but I figured out that this is only half of the land so then I changed it to one fourth and one eighth and one eighth	I know one fourth plus one eighth plus one eighth would equal one half and one half plus one half is a whole	sd	5
Does everybody agree with Marie on this problem	Yes	b	1
Ray do you want to share something else	I did the same thing as Marie except I drew it a different way	sd	2
I did the same thing as Marie except I drew it a different way	The queen still gets her half and the oldest daughter gets one fourth of the land and the two younger daughters get one eighth of the land	sd	5
The queen still gets her half and the oldest daughter gets one fourth of the land and the two younger daughters get one eighth of the land	Then I did one half plus one fourth plus two eighths equals one	sd	5
Grant did you get something different	I got something different	sd	2
Oh come up and share	I did a lot of explaining on this	sd	1
I did a lot of explaining on this	I ended up with each sister the older sister gets a fourth out of sixteenths because the mom wants to get half of her	sd	5
What is four out of 16	Four out of 16 is	sd	1
Whats equivalent to four sixteenths	One fourth	sd	4
If you divide by four on the top and bottom you get one fourth	Oh	b	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Agree disagree or have a question about one of our responses on the board	I agree with the first one phrase because on 14 if you multiply both of the numbers by two it gets you to 28 which is really close to the	sd	5
So I heard you say that 14 is equivalent to 28	Yes	b	1
What is 12 how many 18 would that be	48	b	4
What might you say to them	I would say to make sure that you check what the numbers can be	sd	4
Okay like equivalent fractions	Yes	b	1
All right Kylie agree disagree or have a question	I agree with four	sd	2
What is 58 really close to	Its really close to 12	sd	4
Yes so its sort of like we have 12 plus 12	Plus 18	sd	4
How do you know that its a little bit bigger than one	Because its a little bit bigger	sd	5
Which one	He knows that 58 is a little bit bigger than 18 and its a two	sd	5
Quinn what would you like to add	To add on that I know that its more than one because 12 and 58 is more than 12 of an 88 so 12 plus 18 is more than a 12 is more than one its	sd	5
What does that say	Is closest	sd	1
Or closest to 510 which is 12	I dont know what that says	sd	3
I hope you just figured that out	Yes I see it	sd	1
Yes I see it	I understand it	sd	1
Whats a question that you think someone could ask if theyre not sure how to solve this problem	I think I know	sv	1
Jason whats the question you might ask if you needed help starting with number two	What would 58 be closest to in a fraction	sd	4
Maybe we could also think about it like money	Yes like its 58 cents	sd	4
Whats 58 cents close to	50	b	4
50	50	b	2
Its close to 50 cents	Then you could like round it down	sd	4
Yes we could round down 58	Yes	b	1
How much bigger would it be	Wait you mean in decimals	sd	1
Thats for like 80 cents is the 80 cents bigger	No	b	1
No	Oh wait 8000 wait	sd	4
Oh wait 8000 wait	In between	sd	1
What place that is in between 10ths	8100	b	4
What do you think Kylie	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Yes	b	1
Its 8100ths bigger	Okay I was like yes	sd	1
Yes Caroline	I think it would be a lot closer to the fourths not too far from one here	sd	4
If you want to come join me at the front of the room youre more than welcome to do that but page 58	What page	sd	1
What page	18	b	1
Does your page 58 look like this	Yes	b	1
In your note catcher	Yes you forgot a pencil up there	sd	1
Thats okay	Well make the best of it	sd	1
Its getting old	How old	sd	1
How old	Like really old	sd	1
Like really old	very crazy named it	sd	1
What did you name it	I realized its a girl and then each year froze	sd	1
I realized its a girl and then each year froze	We were like Oh girl you can do it	sd	1
All right go ahead and put your pencil in your note catcher close it	What page is that	sd	1
What page is that	58	b	1
Quinn do you know	15	b	4
I have 10 and 1015 yes	How do you find the common multiple	sd	3
The common multiple	Yes	b	1
If I think about counting by threes I could go 3 6 9 12 1518 and then count by fives and go 5 10 15 20 and I can see that they have a common multiple of 15	Would you like multiply them together	sd	4
Yes Jordan	I think you only because if you do 3 times 5 is 15 and 3 times 2 is six and yet three times	sd	5
Please say that again for me	3 times 5 is 15	sd	5
You guys feeling okay about that one	Yes	b	1
Is that coming back to you a little bit from elementary school	Yes	b	1
Parker what are you thinking	No	b	1
No what are you thinking	I thought three	sd	4
What do you think Chris	36	b	4
Ill start with a common factor for 9 and 12 is	Three	sd	4
9 divided by 3 is 3 and 12 divided by 3 is 4	Then were done	sd	4
5 times 4 is	Twenty	sd	4
We have one two three so we have one two three	Three	sd	4
Whats seven times three crew	Twentyone	sd	4
Brianna what are you thinking	One and 536	sd	4
I want to see your	Ms wrote it	sd	1
Whats the common multiple between 9 and 6	Three	sd	4
Well thats a common factor but were looking for a common multiple	Its four	sd	4
Its four	Nope thats a factor	sd	2
You have three	Its 24	sd	4
Whats three plus five	Three plus five is eight	sd	5
You can get back on	Were done	sd	1
Do you see how theyre all of your steps here	Yes	b	1
Thats the common factor between	Why is it moving towards her	sd	1
Will you go help Will you go help Caroline	Yes	b	1
What do you have for number one	Nine and 16	sd	4
Nine and	16	b	4
Oh Id love to see your work	We got nine and 37	sd	4
I want to see your work for that one	This I did in my head	sd	1
What	I got 13	sd	4
Just have	Its 12 nine and 12	sd	4
Its 12 nine and 12	On the second one we got 13 and 1740	sd	4
Do you guys see how I went through all my steps here	Yes	b	1
Hey crew this is your minute and a half warning	Were done	sd	1
Were done	What do we do now	sd	1
How did you get eight and 96 to nine and 12	Eight 96	sd	4
Eight Plus 96 is the same as one and 36	Parker stop	sd	1
Bless you	Thank you	aa	1
What do you think	They forget to find	sd	4
Im going to go one two three and I want to hear from all of you	Fifteen	sd	4
One whole is made up of	115s	b	4
You can say it	115s	b	4
How many 115s	1515	b	4
Do you like my picture	Yes	b	1
I practice all day for you guys	Wow	ba	1
Wow	That was good	sd	1
Its called the roundup and add back you say it	Roundup and add back	sd	1
What would that be crew	12 and 615s	sd	4
Do you guys want to do one more together	Yes	b	1
All right	Yes please	sd	1
What do you think Quinn	A common denominator between eight and three is	sd	1
What do you think Adam	Twentyfour	sd	4
Im going to round up so Im going to subtract six	Right yes	b	1
Im going to have seven and 3124s but remember I cant have a mixed number and an improper fraction here	Which equals eight and seven	sd	4
I will see you guys later	How about homework Ms Davies	sd	1
What do we get if we have the fraction 7500 what does that look like as a decimal	075	b	4
What strategy are you using to go from fraction to decimal	75 blocks	sd	4
Do I have any big pizzas	Yes	b	1
How many tens do I have	Seven	sd	4
Youre with me	Yes	b	1
Emmanuel what did you get	I got 036	sd	4
What do you guys think	Yes	b	2
What fraction do we have	310	b	4
Do you guys all agree	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes we do	sd	1
Yes we do	Its straw	sd	4
Why do you say its 300	Tenths	sd	4
Tenths	I wrote 1003 you still get a half 1000100 and you say that 3 under the 100	sd	5
Grenada	3100	b	4
Do you guys agree its 3100	Yes	b	2
What do I have to do to 20 to get a hundred	I am going to have to times	sd	4
Times what	Times five	sd	4
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
10 x 5 2 x 5 what do I get		b	4
60	Yes	b	1
Now can I turn it into a decimal	Yes	b	1
Whats our decimal	06	b	4
Grenada what did you do	I divided it	sd	5
I divided it	Like this one this fraction at the bottom I divided by 2 and the top I also divided by 2 and then I got 610	sd	5
Ready to try another one	Yes	b	1
Hard one	No	b	1
Isnt he	Does he have a microphone	sd	1
Does he have a microphone	Maybe more microphones	sd	1
In order to make a fraction what do I have to do	You have a point	sd	4
You have to have a denominator of 10 or		b	4
We could go to 100 by multiplying by		b	4
2 times 3 is  and 20 times 3 is  60	They are the same with just a zero	sd	4
However when we write this 610 looks like		b	4
60100 looks like		b	4
Yes because if we do this as a picture would we have any whole pieces	No	b	1
Do we have any longs	Yes	b	1
Do we have any babies	No	b	1
Do I still get the same amount	Yes	b	1
Yes	Its like if you have 35 and times two	sd	5
Its like if you have 35 and times two	It would get six	sd	5
It would get six	How would you get the tenths for it to get 610	sd	3
Say that again	How would you get the six how would you get the twos to make 610	sd	3
How did we get 610 here	No	b	1
No	How did you get those twos that are three	sd	3
I know my fraction down here is going to be 100 out of how many pieces do I get	Eight	sd	4
How many do I get	Eight	sd	4
Ariana		b	4
If I had to draw this out using flats longs and babies what would I draw for this	Nine longs	sd	4
I outline this place and then just do one of these	Miss we do the same thing to the other up to five because its 09 00	sd	5
Good	Yes	b	1
You guys ready	Yes	b	1
On your marks get set	Okay	b	1
Whos going first	As	aa	1
Nylah lets start with you	So I thought it was nine times six because in each of those little boxes theres threebythree and three times three is nine	sd	5
Okay	And there was six this way and that way and then I just did nine times six and I thought it was 56	sd	5
Try that one more time	Oh it would be 54	sd	4
Go for it	Okay so when I saw it I saw that there was three in each and three right there	sd	5
Okay so when I saw it I saw that there was three in each and three right there	And I did three times three and three times three in the upper row and the bottom row and added that and I got 18	sd	5
And I did three times three and three times three in the upper row and the bottom row and added that and I got 18	And so twos 18	sd	5
So you saw three times three once	Yeah	b	1
And then you saw three times three again	And then	sd	1
Okay	I saw two of those boxes equaled 18 and if one is nine then three must be 27	sd	5
And then what did you do	And then I said well two of them is 18 then three of them would be 27 and so I took the bottom row is 27 and the top row is also going to be 27	sd	5
Jude	So I kind of saw something similar except to find the six boxes I thought for some reason that they were like one big box and then I did two and three and then I did two times three equaled six boxes and then I just looked at the squares and counted three times three which is nine and then I just multiplied to that	sd	5
So I kind of saw something similar except to find the six boxes I thought for some reason that they were like one big box and then I did two and three and then I did two times three equaled six boxes and then I just looked at the squares and counted three times three which is nine and then I just multiplied to that	And then with that	sd	1
And then you did that times You saw three groups by two groups	Yeah	b	1
Yeah Asa	I didnt do it this way but you could add the top of a box with all the tops would which would equal nine and then you could go by the side and basically make it one big square and itd be six times nine	sd	5
Would you guys like to do another one	Yes	b	1
Be ready for this one	Is it harder	sd	1
No its just different	That was very skeptical	sd	1
You guys ready	Yes	b	1
So on your marks get set go	So what I did	sd	1
So what I did	I got to count all of them and then there were clumps of a six and then down I counted seven so I did six times seven to get 42 and then I knew to divide that in half to make half circles and then I still didnt get an answer from that	sd	5
Go for it	Well I think I counted wrong so I dont think I have the right answer but I do know how to do it	sd	4
Yeah tell us your strategy	So what I counted is I counted the left column and the top row and then I multiplied those by each other	sd	4
So what two numbers did you multiply	Six and eight	sd	4
I like your strategy to think about it like an array	And then I divided it in half	sd	4
Why did you divide it in half	Well because since the things were half of them I decided that instead of making it three times four I would just divide it in half	sd	5
So whats 48 divided by two		b	4
Did I hear from Jason last time	No	b	1
Go for it Jason	So what I did is I saw that there was eight in one row	sd	5
So what I did is I saw that there was eight in one row	Eight halves	sd	5
Eight halves	So then I just counted essentially six rows in total	sd	5
So then I just counted essentially six rows in total	I took two of them two of the rows and added them together since they were half of a whole	sd	5
I took two of them two of the rows and added them together since they were half of a whole	So counted it up	sd	5
So counted it up	Since there were six rows there was three rows in each so I added those	sd	5
Since there were six rows there was three rows in each so I added those	That is 48	ba	5
That is 48	And then half of it is 24	sd	5
And then you saw those two groups three times	Yeah	b	1
So he did six times two because there were six You said there were six in each row or in each column	Eight in each	sd	4
Campbell did we hear from you last time	No	b	1
Go for it	All right	aa	1
All right	So I got two answers because I wasnt sure what the bottom row was	sd	5
So I got two answers because I wasnt sure what the bottom row was	It was either seven or eight	sd	5
It was either seven or eight	So I did both of them	sd	5
So I did both of them	So I counted the top row was six and the bottom which was seven or eight	sd	5
So I counted the top row was six and the bottom which was seven or eight	And then so then I found that half of both of those because  each half was four and have half of each of those and for six is three and for seven is 35 but for eight it was four	sd	5
And then so then I found that half of both of those because  each half was four and have half of each of those and for six is three and for seven is 35 but for eight it was four	So then I timesed it together and I got 12	sd	5
Yes Jude	So I saw it was seven	sd	4
So I saw it was seven	So I got a 21	sd	4
So I got a 21	Yeah same	b	2
Yeah same	I got seven	sd	2
I got seven	I counted seven	sd	2
I counted seven	I could like it could be a	sd	1
Like seven	No seven going down	sd	4
So seven this going vertically	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then going horizontally I got six so then I did that times six times seven and then I got 42 so I just divided it by two because I knew that they were all in half which equaled 21	sd	5
And then going horizontally I got six so then I did that times six times seven and then I got 42 so I just divided it by two because I knew that they were all in half which equaled 21	But also if it was eight in the red maybe 24	sd	5
She saw these groups right here and shes like well if I put these together and kind of flip this one around and match them Is that right Jason	Yeah	b	1
Alicia	I did it in an even different way	sd	2
I did it in an even different way	So I took the top row which is six and then I put each of those together to put two halves together to make three wholes	sd	5
So I took the top row which is six and then I put each of those together to put two halves together to make three wholes	And then I went down the sides	sd	5
And then I went down the sides	I was too nervous	sd	1
I was too nervous	I think I got seven and then I did three times seven	sd	5
So you kind of matched them this way	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You could also divide six by whats it called two to get three rows and then you would use seven and then do seven times two equals 14	sd	5
You could also divide six by whats it called two to get three rows and then you would use seven and then do seven times two equals 14	And then plus 14 equals 17	sd	5
So that would be three times seven which is 21	Oh not seven not 17 sorry	sd	4
I think its page seven in your pink packet	What a coincidence	sd	1
Listen to the word equivalent	Equal to	sd	4
Yeah	Speaking of that on the long weekend we actually doubled the recipe of a cake and it tasted the same	sd	1
Did you make two cakes or did you just double the size of your cake	Doubled the size	sd	1
What kind of cake	Lemon raspberry	sd	1
Carolina	Well this was a few weeks ago but I was making Parmesan and if I followed the normal recipe it was going to be too much because we didnt need that much so I cut it in half	sd	1
Yeah Gavin	So I made hot cocoa for my family a few weeks ago and theres 15 people in our family so I have to triple the recipe	sd	1
I love all of this practicing youre doing and I dont know why Im not coming over to all of your houses for desserts all the time	You can come over for Thanksgiving if you want	sd	1
Has anyone ever had tuna noodle casserole	No	b	1
Where have you had it before	My mom makes it	sd	1
Yeah Campbell	I was having some in preschool and threw it up on the side of the road	sd	1
What do you guys think is in tuna noodle casserole	Tuna and noodles	sd	1
I dont think there	Cheese	aa	1
Not in the recipe but there could be	Is there those little crispy things	sd	1
This is something that I remember having at my grandmas house when I was little	My mom My grandma made that	sd	1
During the last five minutes add the French fried onions and let sit for 10 minutes before cooking	Serving	sd	1
Use your recipe on page seven if you need a reminder	Do we need to write two sentences	sd	1
Yeah	Do we have to write it like cups and ounces	sd	1
How much soup do we need	10	b	4
How much cheese do we need to get Allie	Would it be one one cup	sd	4
Go for it	Three cups	sd	4
Yes Jude	So I did 10 and then I did the two little dots for them and then one and then dots and then three	sd	5
So I did 10 and then I did the two little dots for them and then one and then dots and then three	Does that still work	sd	1
Yeah	Are commas okay too	sd	1
All right go ahead man	So I made the set of lockers	sd	5
So I made the set of lockers	And then I found  eight	sd	5
And then I found  eight	Why eight	aa	1
Why eight	Because remember	sd	1
Because remember	And then	sd	1
So you set up eight lockers	This person every single one of these	sd	4
I couldnt follow	I made an oval	sd	5
I made an oval	So heres Jim	sd	5
So heres Jim	So every other block	sd	5
A little louder	All right	aa	1
All right	So now Jimmy two is going to go to	sd	4
Jimmy two we got two Jimmys	Yes	b	1
Yes	Every kid is named Jimmy	sd	1
Thats kind of confusing	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So every other locker  and she would agree to every third	sd	4
So when you had your sample size how did you come up with your final number based on your sample size	Well I used a pattern	sd	4
What was the pattern	So it started going by fours so it started going too long so it was that	sd	5
Words are hard	So it started going down	sd	4
So it started going down	Theres only one locker each time	sd	4
Okay so what was your final answer	It was 200 because	sd	4
200 opened or 200 closed	200 open	sd	4
Okay	Because theres 800 here and then how many were open  and then 800 divided by 4 is 200	sd	5
Do you want this or not	No	b	1
Okay	So what I put down is I drew 10 lockers and I put the number 108 because 100 times 10 is 1 000	sd	5
So what I put down is I drew 10 lockers and I put the number 108 because 100 times 10 is 1 000	So  I put O for open  and then I did closed and then	sd	5
What gave you your final number based on your what you saw from your sample	So then I got online	sd	1
So then I got online	And I got seven and then I multiplied that by 100 and got 700 lockers where clothes and  that was three and I multiplied that by 100 and its 300 lockers	sd	5
Walk us through yours	Okay so I drew 100 lockers and I drew 10 people	sd	5
Okay so I drew 100 lockers and I drew 10 people	And I kept number one because they were already open so number one number two number two is right	sd	5
And I kept number one because they were already open so number one number two number two is right	So I put a red tally on every single one that was closed	sd	5
So I put a red tally on every single one that was closed	So number three I used blue four was orange five actually I used gray six was blue seven was brown eight was purple nine was yellow and ten was dark red	sd	5
Okay	And then once I was done I counted how many were open and closed	sd	5
And then once I was done I counted how many were open and closed	And there were 55 that were open and 45 that were closed	sd	5
And there were 55 that were open and 45 that were closed	And then I multiply that by 10	sd	5
And then I multiply that by 10	And I got 450 closed and 550 open	sd	5
But you when youre doing your samples do you need to put more people than there are lockers	No	b	1
Mia what do you think	You can just repeat the first person	sd	5
What	You can just repeat the first person on the locker	sd	5
Rory	Well I think the reason you chose that is because that 20 is a factor of 1000	sv	5
Riley	Its gonna well theres a row of 20 lockers	sd	4
So after person one is here every single locker is	Open	b	4
Lucy	Every third	sd	4
Theyre what	Every third	sd	4
Lets have Emerson help me out	Three	sd	4
Rory	Multiples	aa	4
369 12 1518 are multiples of what	Three	sd	4
So whats it going to happen	Close	sd	1
So what is person three gonna do	Open it	sd	4
Whats person number four going to do	Open every fourth locker	sd	4
Going to what	Open every fourth locker	sd	4
Riley what do you think	Its because its a multiple	sd	4
Can one go into eight	Yeah	b	1
Can two go into 8	Yeah	b	1
And if this fifth person comes along and touches every fifth locker which lockers Victoria will be touched by the fifth person	The fifth locker	sd	4
Which locker	The fifth	sd	4
Okay what else	The tenth	sd	4
What else	The fifteenth	sd	4
What else	The twentieth	sd	4
Rory	Eleven	sd	4
Diego	Seven	sd	4
Havent gotten to the seventh person	Four	sd	4
Do they touch any others	No	b	1
So seven is done and it is	Closed	sd	4
Is nine done	Yes	b	1
And is it open	Yes	b	1
Riley what do you think	I think multiply four times five	sd	4
Because if this sample were represented the rest of the way	No 400 times 5	sd	4
Jordan what do you see	The pattern so far is open closed closed open closed closed closed	sd	5
Closed	Oh I didnt notice that last one	sd	1
What locker	25	b	4
Victoria	Divided by three	sd	4
I have what	You have four two and then one more	sd	4
Anthony	Factors	sd	4
Alice whats unique about those numbers and their factors	Each factor is one number	sd	4
What are the factors of the number three	One and three	sd	4

Any number up here	12	b	4
Leah	Four and three	sd	4
What else	Six and two	sd	4
Huh	Even	sd	4
How many factors does nine have	Three	sd	4
But how many factors does 16 have	Three	sd	4
What are all of these numbers	Odd	b	4
Which means all of our closed lockers have what	An even number	sd	4
And all of our open lockers have	Odd	b	4
Victoria what do you think	Times five	sd	4
But what types of numbers have an odd number of factors	Square numbers	sd	4

Mia	Shapes	sd	4
Huh	The only thing I know about geometry is that I feel like shapes	sd	4
Rory	Angles	sd	4
In our world that has a name and were going to find it	Its a point	sd	4
When did we use it	Decimal point	sd	4
What does it do	The decimal point separates your whole from your fractions	sd	4
Anybody have a guess in geometric terms what a point is	A point is where something starts	sd	4
What did I just draw	A dash	b	4
A dash	A line sorry	sd	4
Or do you know what it is	I think I know	sv	1
Emerson theyre called	Line segments	sd	4
So a line segment looks just like a line except where the arrows are there is a starting point and a	Ending point	sd	4
For our line segments we put points on the ends for our starting and our stopping point but does a line have points	No	b	1
Rory	Is it called a ray	sd	4
Do you know Miss Rory what a ray is	Where theres a point and a line going on forever	sd	4
Aria	Because its passing through	sd	5
Can I have more	Yes	b	1
Charlie what did I do	Wrote A and B	sd	4
Diego	You labeled them	sd	4
But what did I use	Lines	sd	4
Good you got something to learn man	I think its a shape thats	sv	4
Its still line segment A B F is just a	Passthrough	aa	4
Guys I would use a text box and make sure youre using a white inkWhy will it not let you	I dont get this	sd	3
I dont get this	T	b	1
Point seventy 2	I dont get this	sd	3
3 times oh youre just doing the math enter number here 21	T can use my white whiteboard for this	sd	1
Yes you may	Ms Strathom  I cant type the letters in the box	sd	1
What	Its letting me type only the top row	sd	1
Its letting me type only the top row	Its letting me check numbers in the top row of the letters but I cant get x	sd	1
Are you trying to explain	T I cant What I mean is I cant type x for the times	sd	1
Just type the answers in	Okay	b	1
Okay	You wont know if its ours because we cant type letters	sd	1
Just type in the answers	T	b	1
Yes	I have a question	sd	3
Okay	So when we multiply the like the three tenths times the seven tenths like do we put like the two numbers	sd	3
So when we multiply the like the three tenths times the seven tenths like do we put like the two numbers	Like do we put 21 Or just 021	sd	3
Is that what you just asked me	Yes	b	1
So if I multiply 300ths times seven tenths Do I really have two holes Maddy	No	b	1
There you go	T	b	1
Im sorry what	T	b	1
T	Um inaudible so that answers might have to be like smushed together	sd	1
Adam do you know what youre doing buddy	Im adding both	sd	4
What honey	I said Im adding both of the answers	sd	4
So make sure you are writing your answer on your whiteboard	I dont know how to	sd	3
I dont know how to	inauidble Thats like way too much	sd	1
What are you saying Adam	Im saying like thats its hard	sd	3
Im going to stop sharing and I am going to ask Miss Julia to turn her camera on	Okay	b	1
Go ahead	I use this I use a sticky note just because my dry erase marker ran out	sd	1
I use this I use a sticky note just because my dry erase marker ran out	So I did the twenty one plus the inaudible And when I did that I got to 200 I mean 231000ths and then I added that by the 6 plus 6 the those ones and that and then when I added them all together I got 3007 3000 2376 thousandths	sd	5
Okay Landon do you agree and why	Well Im kinda confused	sd	3
Thank you	I just dont understand area model inaudible	sd	3
Okay so is the purpose right now understanding the area model or adding the decimals together	Adding the decimals together	sd	4
Do you see how all of my decimals are in a row	Yeah	b	1
So do you see the difference between your whiteboard and my whiteboard Landon	Yeah	b	1
What did I do that you did not do	I think I started with the biggest number first and then I did  the smallest	sd	4
The order I put the numbers in or lining the decimals and place values up	Lining the decimals and place values up	sd	4
Can you do that Landon	Yeah	b	1
Okay now what Im going to do is I am going to do this student paced and you are going to work together Im going to keep a group of you with me	Can I work with a group this time	sd	1
Everyone needs to join	T	b	1
Yes	I have to go inaiudible	sd	1
And guys Im gonna have you do this on your whiteboard and paper rather than on the paradox	T	b	1
Yes	Mine isnt loading and Ive tried to reload it but its not working	sd	1
Landon Does that make sense to you	Um are you doing like are you doing like the real problem	sd	1
Um are you doing like are you doing like the real problem	Because its supposed to be 4700ths	sd	5
Landon		b	4
So how youre going to multiply	So how youre going to multiply this is you are going to do seven times seven	sv	4
Okay	Which equals 49	sd	4
Okay where am I going to put the nine Maddy	You are going to put the nine under zero Itd be 009	sd	4
You are going to put the nine under zero Itd be 009	I think	sv	1
009  okay so now what am I gonna do with the four the Four Maddy	Um it would be in four tenths	sd	4
Um okay so now what am I going to do Maddy	You are going to bring the decimal down and put it in front of the four	sd	4
Because remember when we get 28 we had a whole because I had two wholes from my 10th	Yeah	b	1
Does that make sense	That makes sense now	sd	1
Oh all right Duncan go tell me what Im doing now	Okay so what you would do next would be for tenths times  one 100ths	sd	4
Okay so what you would do next would be for tenths times  one 100ths	And that would equal	sd	4
What does that equal	Um it would equal point 5000ths	sd	4
But four times one is not five	Oh no its four	sd	4
Can you turn your mic on please	Yeah	b	1
sWhat is the next thing I am going to do	You have to do seven tenths times 1100ths	sd	4
Do you see	Oh okay	b	1
What is one 100ths times 700ths	Um is it I think its 710 1000ths	sv	4
Reese what is the first thing I have to do Reese before I start adding these What do I have to make sure Ive done	Your supposed to inaudible I cant really see your screen that well	sd	1
Your supposed to inaudible I cant really see your screen that well	The multiplying part	sd	1
No weve already multiplied Reese	Yeah I know but adding	sd	4
What am ai doing over here	Adding	sd	4
Im doing	Adding	sd	4
but what is the First thing I need to make absolutely sure Id done before I start adding these	the decimals are lining up	sd	4
decimals or lining up Adam what else do I need to make sure lines up	The numbers	sd	4
Okay add your numbers up and be ready to share your answer	I cant see the numbers	sd	1
Well if you were doing this Ela with me you should have been writing them down	I am	sd	1
I am	I am doing them with you	sd	1
Duncan can you share your answer with us	Um so I got 28 850  wait no	sd	4
read the numbers to me first	Um so 28 and then 49	sd	4
Can you see my screen	I did it like this	sd	4
28 0049 0004 00007	Yeah thats what I did	sd	4
Okay so what is seven plus zero	plus zero is seven	sd	1
whats nine plus four	Um that would be 13 So then carry the one	sd	4
And alls you will be doing is solving themYou will be writing out what you will be responsible show you what youll be responsible for momentarily	T can we erase our white boards	sd	1
Are any of these repeating	No	b	1
You can only use one number at a time	But its a lot	sd	1
So what were trying to figure out is whats the biggest value of X you can get at the end and whats the smallest value of X you can get at the end	Do the whole numbers 1 through 9 need to be positive or it can be negative	sd	3
They need to be positive	Because theyre whole	sd	5
Then see if you could eventually find the biggest option or the smallest option	Does it have to be in between 1 and 9	sd	4
Okay	Why is there money on the wall	sd	1
For the firebird reptilia	What	ba	1
The firebird  The cash and the flash fundraiser	I thought  last semester too	sd	1
I dont think so	Where is there that loud banging noise coming from	sd	1
Make sure you have your homework on your desk please	Wait a minute	sd	1
Homework	Is it four	sd	1
Great thanks buddy	Can I get a stamp	sd	1
Is that	Ive got  play on the movie and then get paid	sd	1
Okay can you show it to me tomorrow	Yes	b	1
Vick try it	Can you hear me	sd	1
Can you hear me	But your answer can be negative	sd	4
Yes but like the numbers on the box is	I think the biggest one is not	sd	1
No you cant use that	I think its 9	sv	4
Hes not good enough	No hes good enough	sd	1
No hes good enough	He has	sd	1
Sylis what do you think for largest	7	b	4
Tell us what numbers you put in	I put in 1x plus 2 equals 9	sd	5
What is x equal to	7	b	4
Say it again Terrance	What if its 1x plus 1	sd	4
You cant repeat two 1s	answer have to	sd	1
answer have to	What if its 1x equals 9	sd	4
Evan do you have an option for the smallest	7	b	4
What numbers did you put in	1x plus 9 equals 2	sd	4
Its most helpful to have 1x because they need this to divide by 1 doesnt really change it	Does the answer have to be 1 through 9	sd	4
Could be a fraction or a decimal	for the x	sd	1
for the x	Like the answer of the equation	sd	1
You mean like the X equals at the end	No	b	1
No	The thing on the right side of the equal sign	sd	1
Because theyre really good at it	What	ba	1
Have you ever seen an elephant hiding in a tree	No	b	1
Because they really good at hiding	I think that was the funniest one Ive ever	sd	1
Do you need to show your steps exactly like I do every time	No	b	1
I just noticed that	Hi	b	1
Did anybody in here get X equals 2 as a final answer	Wait for E	sd	1
Wait for E	No	b	1
Thank you	I got X equals 2 but then I just multiply them both by 1	sd	5
Its not a dead end if you get to here you just have to know how to change it really quick	I got five but I think its the	sd	4
Like 10 divided by 5	Yes	b	1
Yes you might have 10 divided by 2	Yes	b	1
Terrance	What math would you have to do to get X equals 2	sd	3
You get X equals 25 and so its easy to change it into X just by changing both sides X equals 25	You just take it away	sd	4
If X equals 2 whats the opposite of X	2	b	4
Regina	I got 1265 for D	sd	4
I got 1265 for D	Yes	b	2
Yes	I got 1265	sd	2
I got 1265	Then I got 21429 for a number	sd	4
Regina what did you divide by the end	10	b	4
Tobias why are these more tricky	I think because they have a plus on 1 or I was going to say	sd	5
Tomas	Because they have an X on both sides	sd	5
X on both sides you see that Tobias	Yes	b	1
Okay	What would happen if you have an answer that is 5XX	sd	3
Wait how did you get that	Would that be the same as 5X squared	sd	4
Yes I could see or Ill look at your because it shouldnt happen for these problems	No I was just wondering	sd	1
We actually will talk about some of those things in two units from now	Okay	b	1
Ill show you	Also to the  sign in	sd	1
Thanks	Mr G can I start	sd	1
Yes you can start	I already started	sd	1
I already started	Mr G	b	1
You type in Google Classroom	These are the worst	sd	1
These are the worst	Find the mistake	sd	1
I know its  has the five	Really	aa	1
Really	Look Im already on this	sd	1
Look at the instructions on the board and none of the instructions say  do the practice game	Mr G you said there was a	sd	1
Mr G you said there was a	Wheres the code	sd	1
Wheres the code	Right here	aa	1
On Tuesday it should say period seven code	I joined	sd	1
I joined	How do we open that	sd	1
How do we open that	Does anyone know the code	sd	1
You click over here	Mr G whats the code for your classroom	sd	1
Then  do you have a Khan Academy account	Yes	b	1
Just make sure that your name is at the top if you have one and then if not then youll create one	Then click on the first	sd	1
Is this yours now	Yes	b	1
If youre okay with it you can just make your date of birth the year two years earlier because then it wont ask you to do that and it makes it easier for your account or you can put your own emails there and then approve it or you can put parents email	Could we put yours	sd	1
Scroll up	Is that where you put	sv	1
do you have a Khan Academy account	How did they know my email	sd	1
You have a Khan Academy account	Yes I think I made	sd	1
Regina did you go to Google Classroom	Yes	b	1
Get rid of a tab up here	Mr G what is	sd	1
Then you can just approve it yourself	You do control shift and then that thing and then you	sd	1
Do you have a Khan Academy account	No	b	1
Ruth can you just sign up as well	In this it says we have to get Do we have to 100 in here	sd	1
Youve got an account	100 you just send screenshots	sd	1
Make sure your user names in there	Yes and then	sd	1
Scroll up	only do I have to make a copy	sd	1
That means you didnt open up your own in Google Classroom	You did	aa	1
You did	I did not do that	sd	1
I did not do that	the rules	sd	1
Yes right there	Wait Mr G are we supposed to know	sd	1
Wait Mr G are we supposed to know	Its 0  18 then it would be 18	sd	1
You didnt	Mr G what should we do for a username	sd	1
Just something thats related to your name	Im so confused	sd	1
Im so confused	My name because I have an account my names	sd	1
A rectangle from there to here	Mr G can I make a new account	sd	1
No	Why not	sd	1
Lets go Tobias	Its not letting me	sd	1
If you are having trouble either logging on to Google Classroom or making a Khan Academy account please raise your hand and then Ill come help you out	Mr G I dont know what happened	sd	1
No spaces	No space	sd	1
Right here	That	aa	1
Yes you can do that	Itd be smart to enter my address number	sd	1
What are your two favorite numbers	Six and four	sd	1
Then as we do that	Do I need to do that	sd	1
No then now youre done	Whats the answer	sd	1
Yes	I dont have the wait how do you find your screen	sd	1
How are we doing over here people	Mr G this doesnt have a selector	sd	1
Terrance you need help	Old photos	sd	1
Like your birthday just like 2005	What was that	sd	1
You need to get rid of some tabs	I have to create a parent account	sd	1
Okay and then nice  that need approval	No	b	1
No	Thats not even	sd	1
Im glad it was helpful	I used a link under Google	sd	1
Youre good to go	Mine is not even	sd	1
You start there and then go all the way down there	Yes because I made me my parent	sd	1
This the exercise	Yes like all the really good ones	sd	1
Try it again	What do I do	sd	1
Did you screenshot it	Yes	b	1
You can do insert	Right there	aa	1
Right there	I dont know	sd	1
You did the first one	Yes	b	1
Is it over here	Since I reloaded I wasnt logged in the whole time	sd	1
Since I reloaded I wasnt logged in the whole time	Mr G I reloaded and I wasnt logged in the whole time	sd	1
Log in	I need to redo it	sd	1
You already did this	Mr G where is the score	sd	1
Mr G where is the score	Wait that was practice	sd	1
Wait that was practice	What	ba	1
What	Jamie I dont have any of that	sd	1
you can click that on this one	What	ba	1
Okay	Can I just do this	sd	1
Sabrina whats up	Okay this is my username	sd	1
Thats why it didnt pop up  to do it	It increases	sd	1
It increases	Its 45	sd	1
Its supposed divisible by three  How are we doing over here people	Where are we supposed to go	sd	1
Just let it	P equals eight	sd	4
Thats the wrong Can you X out of that one	What does this do Mr G	sd	1
I think were going to work on it tomorrow as well	Mr G I just figured out two different ways to take screenshots	sd	1
There you go	Take the whole screen	sd	1
Just like	Okay how are you doing screenshots	aa	1
Okay how are you doing screenshots	I just accidentally clicked out	sd	1
I just accidentally clicked out	I did that twice on the same page	sd	1
I did that twice on the same page	Mr G	sd	1
Mr G	Mr G can we use a calculator	sd	1
Its on the  website	Try calculating how much sleep I have	sd	1
Try calculating how much sleep I have	5 I didnt seem to get any	sd	1
5 I didnt seem to get any	Its getting out again	sd	1
Thank you	I couldnt check that part	sd	1
So put the screenshot in there	Mr G	sd	1
Mr G	Negative 2Q	sd	1
Insert image	Thank you brain youre not making a mistake	sd	1
I think your screenshot were all here	What	ba	1
Theres that one	Mr G I cant get my username	sd	1
Then just take a screenshot	Three steps was the wrong answer	sd	1
but if you forget to do that then you can just do this and then you can click on  so you need to submit the ones	Oh thank you and then do we have to have one for every	sd	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	Mr G this is two steps	sd	1
Vick someone	I clicked on the third step because	sd	1
I clicked on the third step because	I dont get this	sd	1
I dont get this	I really want to  right now	sd	1
Do you believe youll be working with a partner for this	Yes	b	1
Whatd you get for the first one Clay	I knew so the 12 of 12 I knew that 66 would equal 12 so 12 of 12 would be 6	sd	5
I knew so the 12 of 12 I knew that 66 would equal 12 so 12 of 12 would be 6	I knew it would be 712 because 77 14 plus 12 and 12 would equal 15 so 712	sd	5
I knew it would be 712 because 77 14 plus 12 and 12 would equal 15 so 712	12 of 40 would be 20 because 202040	sd	5
Okay who can expand and tell us a different way to solve these	You could see how much two could go into 12	sd	5
You could see how much two could go into 12	Six times so that would be the answer but because its an even number about four two goes into 15 that will be 712	sd	5
Another way Franc	You could have 2 times	sd	4
Blank	Blank equals 12 and then you could do 2x7	sd	4
No keep going Franc Im going to stop talking	You could do 2x7 but	sd	4
Okay lets do it again	Thats what you meant as toolboxes	sd	1
Kayla Im going to come to you so you better be getting some answers	Hold on I need to substitute these	sd	4
Try and I will allow you to phone a friend okay	Im stuck	sd	1
Im stuck	Im stuck on the first one	sd	3
So 12 3	To get that and then multiply that and I get the answer	sd	4
Bless you	Thanks	b	1
Thanks	12  is 4	sd	4
4x2 is	Eight	sd	4
Five and 5x2 is	5x2 is 10	sd	5
Okay wait a minute	Wait no Im doing multiplication	sd	4
Wait no Im doing multiplication	Wait	sd	1
Big boys	For the first one I did 3 12	sd	4
Make sure you use the bigger number because itll come out to be Yes	12 34 and then I did four 4x28	sd	5
Do we agree	Yes	b	2
Okay tell me the second one	For the second one I did three times 15 equals five	sd	5
No you did Yes Im sorry	15x3	b	4
3x515 Im sorry	3x515 and then I did 5x210	sd	5
Okay and then what did you do in the last one sweetie	Then I did 3 6020 and then I did 20x240	sd	5
Okay so does five times anything equal 12	No	b	1
No but whats closest to it		b	4
I am then going to let Joseph do the second one and Im going to have Missy coach because you coached that one correct	Yes	b	1
I need you listening she is explaining	For the first one I did 12 5 and got 225	sd	5
Help	It was 23 instead of 13 so you have to divide it by two	sd	2
Why if I times two	Its a whole number	sd	4
Where did the 45 come from	It come from when you just make it four on top of a one	sd	4
Thats what I was wanting you to explain because some of them didnt understand where 45 came from because your partner behind you didnt understand where the 45 came from am I correct	Yes	b	1
Do you remember what it was	25 of 31	sd	4
25 of 31 and explain what you did	What I did was I used  divide five into 31 and I knew that 5x6 will give you 30	sd	5
Okay write it down as youre going	Then I saw that I still had that one you left for it and then put 15 forward and then I saw I needed to multiply it by two so I multiplied it by two and I got 1225	sd	5
Im seeing 15 but Im not seeing 25 on there	I multiplied 2x15 as well to get the 25	sd	4
So you did 615 times two which was 1215 then you did two times	Two times	sd	1
Do you know what Im asking you to do	Yes	b	1
When I multiply those straight Missy across just what do I have	25	b	4
Rebecca you are doing 25 of 81	We first write down 81 and then its 25	sd	4
Of 25	81 5	b	4
Should it be 25 of 81	Yes	b	1
Okay now you may do your process	81 5	b	4
Do you want to 81 in the Okay divided by five	81 5	b	4
I want the answer	You do 81 5	qy	4
Which is what		b	4
16 with what leftover	15	b	4
15	15	b	2
15 leftover so write 1615	1615x2 is 7 two you multiply	sd	5
Right so now shes telling you to do 16x2 which comes out to be what	That would be 1625	sd	4
My five group Im going to have	Miriams gone	sd	1
Okay so I want Kurt to explain what her thinking is and then Im going to have Judy explain his	I do 34 and that I included 12 and then theres 14 left	sd	5
I do 34 and that I included 12 and then theres 14 left	You lift that 14 over into 12 that would make 28	sv	5
You lift that 14 over into 12 that would make 28	Then if you add one of the eighths to a half it would be 58 because you have to make	sd	5
Clairedon you need to be listening please	find the common denominator and it gives you 1218 I got 58	sd	5
Can you do it with the fraction circles	Yes	b	1
She was getting ready to get them to you	12 224 and the 18 I think	sd	4
Okay go	12 is equal to 24 and if you split 412 like Kurt said is 28	sd	5
12 is equal to 24 and if you split 412 like Kurt said is 28	The 14 leftover you split it into 28 and you put 28	sd	5
The 14 leftover you split it into 28 and you put 28	Because theres 28 for each 14 you take 28 over 28 over here you get one more 18 and you put it on each side and that will be 38	sd	5
Do you see how he did that	Yes	b	2
The 12 of What was	Three	sd	4
Was it 12 of 3	Yes	b	1
12 of 3	Were still working on ours	sd	1
Dottie are you done	Yes	b	1
It is 12 of 3	and then you have 12 of 2 is one so you can split the leftover 112	sd	4
Agree or disagree	Agree	sd	2
Theres that and theres that	Got it	sd	1
Clairedon what was the most challenging part of that for you	I think the most challenging part of that for me was like if you were to divide like 12 of 24 when I was trying to figure that out I saw that it was hard because you just have a whole that you could spread into pieces to have a fraction to make it into	sd	5
Anyone else want to add to that	My most challenging part was that the whole numbers couldnt be divided by a half	sd	4
When the fraction you mean couldnt be divided by a half	Yes	b	1
Alayna who is your partner at your table with you	I was just saying that	sd	1
The first thing I would like you to do is fold the paper in half vertically	Wait what if it went this side	sd	3
It should look like this am I right	No because now it looks like a book	sd	4
You can have two pieces of paper on your desk	Yes but this was my first piece	sd	1
So if my paper is an entire fruit bar what does it represent now	A half	sd	4
Half of that fruit bar so Larry has half of this fruit bar what part of the half fruit bar are we trying to find	A half	sd	4
Now you are going to fold your sheet in half which is now	The taco way	sd	4
Okay so now you had it folded this way now youre going to open it up and fold it in half	Fold this	sd	1
What does this represent	14	b	4
What is it really	12	b	4
12 of a	12	b	4
Which means Larry gave his brother	14	b	4
My whole sheet was what type of	A whole	sd	4
Then I folded it because Larry only had	No it was a 14	sd	4
No Larry only had	12	b	4
Then he wanted to split what he had with his brother	He gave him 14 of the bar so he has 34 left	sd	5
So a half of the half is a	14	b	4
Oh my gosh disconnected that is going to make me crazy	Sorry	b	1
Your book is gone then	Awesome	sd	1
Hi this is a hot little mess	Yes	b	1
We keep pushing it down but it keeps coming back	So I dont know if youve seen the Chronos Extreme covers basically you just need an extreme cover	sd	1
I just want this gone to work	Okay	b	1
I dont know	Okay	b	1
Okay	You know what	sd	1
You know what	Im actually going to send these things back now with another guy and just get you slotted with our main package	sd	1
What is this	A whole	sd	4
A whole what	A whole veggie pizza	sd	4
So what are we going to do	Fold it in half	sd	4
Kaylee what am I going to do to represent what part of the pizza Ava has	Were going to fold this into two halves and were going to color or pencil one of these halves	sd	4
Okay wait Asher what am I representing with my paper	12	b	4
12 of what	12 of the veggie pizza	sd	4
Who has the half of the pizza	Ava	sd	4
What am I folding it into	Fourths	aa	4
How are you folding it	Into thirds	sd	4
Into thirds	You cant fold it like that	sd	2
How am I folding the paper	Into thirds	sd	4
Does everyone have a piece of paper that looks like mine	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
What did she eat	23 of the pizza	sd	4
Color in two of those thirds	of a part of a pizza forget it	sd	4
How much of a whole pizza did she eat	23	b	4
How much of that half did he share with his brother	14	b	4
How much of the whole pizza did she take	A half	sd	4
How much did she eat	23	b	4
Ready	I have no	sd	1
In this first one what am I going to fold this paper into	A half	sd	4
What am I folding the paper into what does it tell me to do first	a half	sd	4
Explain why I would do a half first	Because if you did 13 then you can find it	sd	5
Because if you did 13 then you can find it	Its not a 12 of a 13 its	sd	5
In my book what would I do here	Fold	sd	4
Now what do I need to look at next	You need to look at 13	sd	4
Do I need to color in my half	Yes	b	1
Okay now what am I folding the paper into	23	b	4
Okay so now does my paper represent a 13 of a half	Yes	b	1
What does my paper now represent	a half	sd	4
No whats the answer	23	b	4
No	16	b	4
16	Because its	sd	1
How many total pieces do I have	Seven	sd	4
How many of them did I use	13	b	2
Do the next one by yourself	Ourselves	sd	1
Split it in half Clay	sit on the chair	sd	1
What is my fraction	46	b	4
What did you come up with	26	b	4
Youre going to pick one to model on a piece of paper the other one youll get to draw	Okay	b	1
Okay	Yes	b	1
So whats the first thing you need to divide the paper into	Fourths	aa	4
Here Kayla that was yours for you homework	Will you give us time to	sd	1
What do you think is easiest to split it into	Fourths	aa	4
lets count them	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	One two three four	sd	1
One two three four	Three by four	sd	1
Now I have to divide it into what	Thirds	sd	4
How many of those thirds am I going to color in	So then youll have 112	sd	4
Why do I have 112 Becca what does that tell me I have	12 squares	aa	4
Ricardo youre looking at me funny	Why did you not color that one as well	sd	3
That comes out to be 112	You didnt actually give us the whole	sd	4
What do you think Gabby	Another strategy though it might be similar to find a common denominator	sd	4
Well yes	That makes sense	sd	1
That makes sense	Yes because 4X312	sd	5
So did we apply and extend our understanding of finding fractions of whole numbers to finding fractions of fractions	Yes	b	1
Do I expect you all to be pros at it	No	b	1
Can I what	Never mind	sd	1
Is it definitely recording	Yes	b	1
Yes	counting	sd	1
counting	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes its counting	sd	1
Yes its counting	Yes your face is on it now	sd	1
Whats happening	He put the kleenex over the camera	sd	1
He put the kleenex over the camera	No I didnt do it	sd	1
No I didnt do it	Yes you did	aa	1
Yes you did	No I didnt	sd	1
No I didnt	Jane you know he did	sd	1
Jane you know he did	You guys stop talking	sd	1
Do you remember doing that	Yes	b	1
Isaiah	38	b	4
38 and how did we know it was 38	We knew that it was 38 because  since  four and eight it would have to  four by two and that would be eight and that  same thing to the numerators	sd	5
28 plus 18 is	Three	sd	4
Three	You dont remember this	sd	1
You dont remember this	No	b	1
If youre talking that means you need help so please raise your hand if you need help	Is this dark blue	sd	1
Is this dark blue	Thats purple	sv	1
12 plus 14 using your fraction circle pieces	12	b	1
What did you do first Isaiah	I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	sd	5
I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	So	b	1
We did cross off the 12	Thats what I was going to say	sd	2
Julian say it again	I already knew 12 was 24 and 24 is equals 12 and then I knew 24 was	sd	5
The next step is 24 plus 14 equals what was our answer	34	b	4
Green	I think its light green	sd	4
I think its light green	Wait I think its the purple right	sv	2
Wait I think its the purple right	Okay purple it is	sd	2
All right does that make sense now	Yes	b	1
Skyler does that makes sense	Yes	b	1
Dont say yes if you dont If youre lying to me dont lie and say yes	I get it	sd	1
Ari can you explain how you got your answer to this one	Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	sd	1
Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	sd	5
What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	Then thats as far as I got	sd	1
Okay then the light green might not be the right one	Its purple	sd	4
Did that work with purple	Yes	b	1
Blake can you explain your thinking for this one please	I know 12 is 48 and then I did four plus three is seven so I got 78	sd	5
Say that again	I knew 12 is 48 so I did 48 plus 38 and I got 78	sd	5
You see the difference there	Yes	b	1
Drew why do we estimate	We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct	sd	5
Have you been using them	Yes	b	1
Josh do you have your answer	Yes	b	1
I like seeing youre thinking	I dont get it	sd	3
How is this problem different from other problems we did	Because 13 and then 12	sd	5
Isaiah	Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	sd	5
Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that	sd	5
What do you think about that Theo	I think that you just have to find a way that both  another fraction that fits into both of them	sv	4
Can you say that again a little louder	You have to find a fraction thats fits evenly in a 12	sd	4
Ava can you repeat what she said	You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13	sd	2
Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Adam share your thinking for me please	Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then	sd	4
Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange	Yes	b	1
Okay	Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	sd	5
Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	Then I used the purple pieces to see that it would be like 612 on each side so then I would take away the two that I used to find that and then it would be 1012 but then you can also convert that to 56	sd	5
You said you used the 14	I just used those to find out Because then I could put the purple pieces over them to see like Because it was a perfect match if I put that and there was room left for the purple	sd	5
So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012	Yes	b	1
Piper	So I learned this strategy at my old school	sd	1
So I learned this strategy at my old school	You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	sd	5
You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	You can multiply them both by each other	sd	5
You can multiply them both by each other	So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it	sd	1
You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right	I know	aa	1
The first thing I heard you say was that you know you could multiply the denominators	Yes	b	1
Then youd have to figure out 12 is how many 16	Three	sd	4
Then you had 36 plus 26 equals	56	b	4
Theo	I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	sd	5
I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56	sd	5
Were going to do	Do I got to press something  because I have no  for this	sd	1
I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think	Yes	b	1
Okay so just do the top one right now 13 plus 14	Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again	sd	3
Were going to learn that in another lesson	No I mean like the one that weve been doing	sd	1
Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112	412	b	4
Does that make more sense	Yes	b	1
I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make	A lot	sd	1
A lot	A lot of more sense	sd	1
Adam	What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	sd	5
What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	Then that would be 412	sd	5
Then that would be 412	Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	sd	5
Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	and got 712	sd	5
Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to	Not try	sd	1
So tell us what youre confused about	I dont know how to add	sd	3
Let me see if I can  No for the whole class to hear	Okay	b	1
Okay	Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	sd	5
Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	sd	5
13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	Then you know that	sd	1
Lydia	You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can	sd	5
Lydia the 13 and the 14 are what colors	Orange and yellow	sd	4
The 112 is which color	Light green	sd	4
What does she need to do with 112 Lydia	Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	sd	5
Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	That would be 412	sd	5
Lydia continue	Then on the 14 do the same thing	sd	1
Then on the 14 do the same thing	Which would be 312 and then 312 plus 412 is 712	sd	5
Skyler does that make more sense	Yes	b	1
Which math tool	Fraction	b	4
So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer	No we dont	sd	1
No we dont	Why is it always doing this	sd	1
Which one of those things will make you more successful	Adding	sd	4
Adding fractions or knowing where the iPad is pointing	Adding fractions	sd	4
Is this one feeling easier than the last one	Yes	b	1
Ari  can you share your thinking	Okay	b	1
Okay	Since Josh  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	sd	1
Since Josh  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	That one worked and those are 15	sd	4
And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they	No	b	1
Theo	I got	sd	1
Respond to what Ari was saying	I think that he would  but but he had to convert into 110 because	sd	2
To convert to 110 because he	Yes because	sd	1
Ari and what do we think about that	I agree with Theo because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410	sd	2
What I want you to do open to page 95 in your Math Journal	Should we	sd	1
Do you think you know the formula for perimeter	Length plus width plus width plus length	sd	4
Everybody read that with me	I can find the area when the perimeter and only one side length are known	sd	1
Everybody tell me the formula for area	Length times width	sd	4
Do we know the width	No	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Hey Louie what did you get	330300	b	4
Right James	I got 3303 because I did 367 because thats the length	sd	5
I got 3303 because I did 367 because thats the length	I got 734 so I know what the length is	sd	5
I got 734 so I know what the length is	Then I did 752 which is the perimeter minus 734 to equal 18 then I divided that by 2 to get 9 so I know that theres nine on each width	sd	5
Then I did 752 which is the perimeter minus 734 to equal 18 then I divided that by 2 to get 9 so I know that theres nine on each width	Then I did 367 x 9 to get 3303	sd	5
Jaden you did too you did the same thing	Yes	b	2
What did James do at the beginning Mila	He knew that in the perimeter was 752 and to get the perimeter you have to add up all the sides to get the same length so if you add those	sd	2
If this is 367 the other side is going to be	367	b	4
Now can I do area on step one	No	b	1
Louie what did he do	He added 3  up together and then he did minus of the perimeter and then minus 752734 and he got 18	sd	2
Who thinks they can summarize step number three and share step number three Jaden	James did 18   9  2	sd	2
Why did he do 18   2	Because he got 18 x 2 and we all know 18 is the product of 9 x 2	sd	2
I see what strategy did you use for multiplication	Partial	sd	4
Did you get it right Louie	No	b	1
What did you do at the beginning	What I did is I added 357 twice and I got 734	sd	5
What I did is I added 357 twice and I got 734	Then I added up to 752 and got 18	sd	5
Then I added up to 752 and got 18	Then I knew that each side was 9 and then I did 9 x 367 and did 300 9 times and got 2700	sd	5
Then I knew that each side was 9 and then I did 9 x 367 and did 300 9 times and got 2700	Then I messed up on 60 9 times I had those and I actually got 440 instead of 540	sd	5
Then I messed up on 60 9 times I had those and I actually got 440 instead of 540	Then I did 7 x 9  63	sd	5
Then I did 7 x 9  63	Then I added those together and got 3000	sd	5
Joey	I would put the 9 on the bottom instead of the 5	sd	4
That would be my one little takeaway from this	I would also put the 9 at the ones	sd	2
What is something that maybe you could think about for next time	Maybe	sd	1
Do you see the one two three and four	List the steps	sd	4
You had that right	Yes I got this	sd	1
Yes I got this	I added 367  367  734	sd	5
I added 367  367  734	I thought that times were 18 so I had 18	sd	5
How did you get the 18 over here	When I got this I got 18 so I got both side for 18	sd	5
When I got this I got 18 so I got both side for 18	Thats how I got the	sd	5
What are you going to do next time if you have the perimeter	Try to split them in half	sd	4
Were going to also look at this second part which is finding areas by subdividing	I dont think I can ever stop counting on that like 507	sd	4
Okay come on over have a seat	He keeps on doing it	sd	1
What is this compared to Are they the same	No	b	1
Jaden	That one isnt a complete square  complete rectangle	sd	4
Knowing how to add things up but something I noticed if I were to complete this rectangle would I know my length and width	Yes	b	1
Hillary whats the length	The length is the three	sd	4
Holly	10	b	4
So everybody add up seven	Seven	sd	1
Plus three	12	b	4
Plus four	16	b	4
Plus 10	26	b	4
Plus six	32	b	4
Beep beep beep beep	Beep beep	sd	1
Mila what are you thinking about this rectilinear figure	You would have to divide it from  You would have to cut that part out then add two together	sd	5
What would be the area	53	b	4
53	54	b	2
Will you please put it down	Its off	sd	1
You turned it off	I didnt even touch it	sd	1
I didnt even touch it	I need a pencil	sd	1
I need a pencil	I didnt turn it off	sd	1
Emma will you turn yours on	I turned them on but they turned back	sd	1
What am I looking for	equal a thing	sd	4
How else could you describe it huh	Equal fractions	b	4
Julia	One half	sd	4
Miguel what are you thinking	Two fourths	sd	4
And what would you do to this Miguel	Put a line in like this	sd	4
Do you agree	Yes	b	1
Same right	Yeah	b	1
Penelope	Three sixths	sd	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
Lets give everybody some think time now	I notice something awesome	sd	1
I notice something awesome	I know the answer but Im not going to raise my hand because I want everyone else to have a chance	sd	1
Owen whats something you notice about the fractions	On the bottom is two four six	sd	5
On the bottom is two four six	Its counting up by twos	sd	5
What do you see Matteo	I see that on the tops its counting one two three	sd	4
Alejandro what do you see	I think Im noticing the numbers on the bottom one two three two four six	sd	4
Miguel	I see that theyre still halves but theyre just cut in half	sd	4
Nathan what do you notice	I think theyre still equal when you cut it in the half	sd	4
I didnt change my amount at all did I	No	b	1
Audrey what do you notice	Pieces are getting smaller	sd	4
Yeah whats happening to my denominator	Getting bigger	sd	4
Ben what did we do	What we did is we just cut it one more time than what the one half is so basically its exactly the same	sd	4
David how else could you explain it	We just added two	sd	4
We just added two slices	Yeah	b	1
James	So really I figured out that if we halve the whole thing so one from half and halve it again	sd	5
So really I figured out that if we halve the whole thing so one from half and halve it again	So if we halve it then we have to double one halves into two fourths	sd	5
Yeah	So I actually had two strategies	sd	1
Okay	So I used adding and multiplication because as you can see at the top of these two numbers it just goes one two but if you count by twos it actually gets here	sd	5
What would you multiply two by to get four	Two fourths I think	sd	4
Two fourths I think	Two times two	sd	2
Do we agree	Yes	b	1
James	So I figured out that really theres another cheat too	sd	1
Okay whats that	The other cheat is you just add one to the numerator and two to the denominator	sd	5
The other cheat is you just add one to the numerator and two to the denominator	Two four six	sd	5
Two four six	One two three	sd	5
Is there a cheat we could use to get to this fraction	Yep	b	1
Did we double	Oh I see	sd	1
Did we double	No	b	1
We went from one piece to how many	Three	sd	4
Did we double	No	b	1
No	Yeah	b	2
What did we do	We tripled	sd	4
Miguel	You can times three	sd	4
You can times three	Yeah because triple means three	sd	5
Yeah so if I multiply by three and I multiply by three what do I get	Three sixths	sd	4
We made equivalent fractions by doing what	Multiplying	sd	4
Are you ready	Yes	b	1
Write this down	This is the words of Samwise	sd	1
Okay	What about multiplication	sd	1
I said multiplication and division	Oh	b	1
Oh	I thought you said	sv	1
Could you do more	Yep	b	1
Is it still equivalent	Uhhuh	b	1
So were saying one half is equal to four not six four whats	Eighths	sd	4
What am I multiplying one half by to get four eighths	You can still count by twos just by getting to the eight and even if you go to the top where it says one and four I dont know what that counts by but I know it still counts by something	sd	4
So what else do I write	By fours	sd	4
Two times four is what	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Two four six eight	sd	4
What did we multiply by	Were quadrupling it	sd	4
We multiplied by four	Is that right	aa	1
That is right	How is it working	sd	3
So now lets look at this one	What happens	ba	3
What happens	Im all of the sudden going	sd	1
Im all of the sudden going	Wait is that Trent	sd	1
I screwed that up	Is that five tenths	sd	1
Hold on	I think you actually did twelfths	sd	4
Do you see that I knew what I was doing and I actually didnt	Its okay	sd	1
Three sixths is the same as one half we agree	Yes	b	1
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
You do to the top	So youre	aa	1
So youre	I think its called quintupling the amount	sd	4
Okay	I cant remember	sd	1
Let me see how youre feeling	Double triple	sd	1
Double triple	Amazing	sd	1
Amazing	Amazing	sd	1
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Whatever I do to the top	You do to the bottom	sd	4
Okay	Miss  You put six tenths	sd	4
Penelope what do you think	I think five	sd	4
I think five	Thats what I was going to say	sd	2
Anybody else think five	Yes	b	2
Remember the rule that whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	sd	1
Whats a fraction you came up with Nathan	Two sixths	sd	4
Nathan what did you multiply by	Multiply	sd	1
Did you use the rule	No	b	1
What do you think Nathan should have multiplied by to use the rule	Three	sd	4
One times two is	Oh yeah	b	1
Right	Yes	b	1
Matteo	Times three	sd	4
What did you get for your fraction	Three on the top and nine on the bottom	sd	4
James whats another one	I actually figured out something	sd	1
Okay	So really you take the one third	sd	5
So really you take the one third	Since its one third you add one to the numerator	sd	5
Since its one third you add one to the numerator	Since its a third you add three to the denominator	sd	5
Thats why I said its multiplication or division	Yeah but I realized if you want to go in order	sd	4
David	By three	sd	4
By three	And by one	sd	4
Penelope	One ninth	sd	4
Penelope	Two eighths	sd	4
Yeah	Two thirds	sd	4
You didnt multiply the top and the bottom	Okay	b	1
What about this one	100 300	b	4
Whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Could we use any number	Yep	b	1
Yeah	You could do 7624	sd	1
You could do 7624	You can do 2426	sd	1
Because whatever we do to the bottom	We do to the top	sd	4
Is this the first time youve  a piece of paper	No	b	1
Are we using pictures anymore	No	b	1
Because were multiplying	Done	b	1
So whats your new fraction	Four and twenty	sd	4
Thats a good one huh	Ive got something	sd	1
Matteo what did you get	Times two	sd	4
Times two	Thats what I did	sd	1
Thats what I did	Two on the top and 10 on the bottom	sd	4
And five times five		b	4
Whatever we do to the top	We do to the bottom	sd	4
Which gives us		b	4
	So that wouldnt work	sd	2
Ben	Four twentieths	sd	4
So you did that one	And I times two that to get eight fortieths	sd	4
Miguel	Times six	sd	4
What is it	Times six	sd	4
What do you get as your numerator	Six thirtieths	sd	4
And I know that whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
So whats two times five	Ten	sd	4
So my numerator is going to be	Ten	sd	4
Whatever I do to the top	You do to the bottom	sd	4
What is nine times four		b	4
		b	2
	Thats also six times six	sd	4
Its pretty easy right	Yes	b	1
Can we use addition and subtraction	No	b	1
When you are finished you are welcome to move to  Question	If were get stuck can we use all our notebook	sd	1
That is always an option with math	I dont know how its possible but how am I getting better at math	sd	1
Because you have the best math teacher in the world	Exactly	aa	1
And Im going to make them kind of smaller so everybody gets a chance to share	Where did Emelia go	sd	1
So hopefully shell make it back	Are there only supposed to be three people in a group	sd	1
About two to three	inauidble	sd	1
inauidble	Okay um I think that nine 095 is bigger than 03 because three would only inaudible and zero point 95 is bigger than three	sv	5
Okay um I think that nine 095 is bigger than 03 because three would only inaudible and zero point 95 is bigger than three	What I said it will work because zero point 95 is bigger than 03	sd	5
Hunter Do you agree with Lionel	Yeah	b	2
How can you justify that	Cuz a 095 is a hundred and 030 is in the tenths	sd	5
It was decimals	inauidble zero	sd	4
Cooper what do you think	No	b	1
No	Like when like her first thing is correct but then her strategy is not	sd	5
Like when like her first thing is correct but then her strategy is not	Because it says like just three instead of she doesnt have any zeros there	sd	5
Because it says like just three instead of she doesnt have any zeros there	So that doesnt make it really correct	sd	5
what did you say at first	Well kind of saying was that 30 that 03 is 30 and zero point 95 is bigger	sd	5
Cooper do you have another example	not really	sd	1
Does it work to do it like that	Oh wait	sd	1
Would it be okay just to say four is less than 76	Yes	b	1
Once you think about that is it really four	No	b	1
River what do you think	I think it one is incorrect because the 03 is equivalent to 30000ths	sd	5
I think it one is incorrect because the 03 is equivalent to 30000ths	And if you do zero point 35 is less than equal to or greater than 04	sv	5
And if you do zero point 35 is less than equal to or greater than 04	But four is equivalent to 40000ths	sd	5
But four is equivalent to 40000ths	Making 35000ths less than 40000ths proving her wrong	sd	5
And Carter do you have an example to justify why it wont work that way	I mean technically have like the same answers as River	sd	2
So you agree with River	inauidble the problem I recognized and was gonna have the same answer as River	sd	2
And well do some more talking in just a few	Back inauidble the meeting andI just saw on chat on on mute and then turn this camera off	sd	1
Back inauidble the meeting andI just saw on chat on on mute and then turn this camera off	finally came off of his camera he left the meeting	sd	1
Thank you	He didnt share yet	sd	1
MSkylerssa what do you notice about that problem	I noticed that it is the exact same numbers that it was in the last problem	sd	4
What do you notice about that MSkylerssa	That	aa	1
Tell us what do you notice about the word problem	The measurements are different	sd	4
Emelia	I think that Skyler Skyler used more dental floss because Paulina	sd	5
I think that Skyler Skyler used more dental floss because Paulina	So four tenths is equal to 40 hundredths	sd	5
So four tenths is equal to 40 hundredths	And 40 is greater than is less than 56	sd	5
And 40 is greater than is less than 56	So thats how I figure if I use 56	sd	5
So thats how I figure if I use 56	So Skyler used more	sd	5
Okay Liam or River go ahead River	I would like to add on to that	sd	2
I would like to add on to that	I saw that 56 zero point 56 is 56000ths	sd	5
I saw that 56 zero point 56 is 56000ths	So when you look at it that way you see that that is more than half	sv	5
So when you look at it that way you see that that is more than half	And that zero point 40 is less than half	sd	5
And why would it be easier	It looks different because it has looks different because at the top two swimmers were at a point 68 thats different	sd	5
It looks different because it has looks different because at the top two swimmers were at a point 68 thats different	As usually it would only be zero point 68	sd	5
As usually it would only be zero point 68	And	sd	1
Are you trying to say that This actually has more than one	Yeah	aa	1
What do you notice after the decimal point with this	They have more numbers	sd	4
68 what	hundredths	sd	4
33	Hundredths	sd	4
Does that make it easier to compare	Yes	aa	1
And so which one is grater	The one that is greater is the 5868	sd	4
Were gonna have a math discussion using math terms	inaudible because 900ths and 009 And 09 to 09 is nine is 100 Is 90 And 009 is just like 9	sd	5
Whoa that was good thinking	I would agree with that	sd	2
Yeah	So Justin got 009 way off	sd	4
Where should that 009 be	It should be on the ninth millimeter	sd	4
So you look at the nine tenths and the nine tenths is really how many hundreds	90 hundredths	sd	4
Compared to nine hundreds is how many pennies	9 hundredths is like nine pennies	sd	4
We all said what	No	b	2
Emelia what do we know about those	That 900ths is nine and nine tenths is 90	sd	4
what would be a good way to say that	Austin is incorrect because The 009 is way off	sd	5
Austin is incorrect because The 009 is way off	09	b	5
Could you say way less	Yeah	b	1
How many hundredths	90	b	4
Do you guys agree with that	Yeah	b	2
And Nice job guys	33 I like numbers that have the same number for both	sd	1
33 I like numbers that have the same number for both	Hi Ms Tolliver	sd	1
did you guys finish number four	Yeah	b	1
Do you agree	We decided We agree	sd	2
We decided We agree	First of all we disagreed	sd	2
First of all we disagreed	But then I but then I looked at it more and then I realized that it theyre pretty much the same fractions	sd	4
But if I put it out of 100 how many hundreds would it be	90	b	4
Its nine	I disagree	sd	2
I disagree	I disagree now	sd	2
Oh why do you disagreeNow Leah	Because I see now that it says if we put them both in the 100ths then its nine out of 100	sd	5
Because I see now that it says if we put them both in the 100ths then its nine out of 100	So that means its its right like at the beginning kind of	sd	5
Oh so id you say 900 is less than 90 hundreds	Yeah	b	1
Hollis how are you feeling about this	Im feeling like a three	sd	1
why theyre not equal	Yeah	b	1
Nice work guys	Miss Tolliver	sd	1
Uh huh	First we all said no	sd	1
First we all said no	But then we changed it to Yes	sd	1
But then we changed it to Yes	Because I saw it as like the nine out of 100	sd	5
Because I saw it as like the nine out of 100	All those big marks would be 10	sd	5
All those big marks would be 10	So then nine would be almost the last one before one to one because then I thought of one as 10	sd	5
So then nine would be almost the last one before one to one because then I thought of one as 10	And then I thought of 90 well and then the 90 if Mark would be right there also	sd	5
And then I thought of 90 well and then the 90 if Mark would be right there also	Ah	aa	1
If you finish you can do prodigy okay	Mr G I have a problem loading the whiteboard	sd	1
Say that again Christopher	I have a problem loading the whiteboard	sd	1
And dont dont worry about the whiteboard for today	Alrighty	aa	1
Alrighty	Thank you Mr g	sd	1
substitute or eliminate	Substitute	sd	4
Okay and then what	Minue nine	sd	4
Okay if W equals one whats V	Then minus nine	sd	4
Or at least like whats the first step for the angles here	What each triangle like add up to 180	sd	4
What each triangle like add up to 180	Like each individual triangle	sd	4
Because I think this is the only one that we know two angles in right	Yeah	b	1
How about z	inaudible 145 inauidble	sd	4
about the sides	Its like a square and all sides are equal	sd	4
	Opposite angles inauidble	sd	4
Is that true for here	Yes	b	1
How about this one are opposite angles congruent	Yes	b	1
In this picture are all the angles the same	No	b	1
Are opposite angles congruent	Yes	b	1
What else do we know for square	They all equal 90 degrees	sd	4
So what do we have on the diagonals in a parallelogram	They bisect eachother	sd	4
How do these diagonals cross each other	90 degree angle	sd	4
Does anybody know what that upside down t means	Starts with a P	sd	1
anybody online knows the opposite of parallel is	Perpendicular	sd	4
Perpendicular	Perpendicular	sd	2
WHat Would this one be		b	4
So someone in here What do we think for this first one	parallelogram	sd	4
And Austin what do you think for the second one over here	For the second one I went with rectangle	sd	4
Okay great someone in here What do we think for the third one	Rhombus	sd	4
Maggie what do you think for this fourth one	A square	b	4
How do you know that Diego	Shape	sd	4
could be anybody online for this one	None	aa	4
It wasnt in the list	Kite	sd	4
Chris what do you think	Square	b	4
Anybody have a guess on this one someone online	Its a rhombus	sd	4
Okay what else do we know about a rhombus	That the diaginals bisect the angles	sd	4
So what does that make this angle up here	58 degrees	sd	4
What does that make 3		b	4
What does that make 2		b	4
180 minus 148 does 32 sound right	Yeah	b	1
Anybody have what what can we start off with Josh	The one that verticle Pt inauidble	sd	4
diagonals in every parallelogram	Theyre diagnal	sd	4
Even if theyre not even if theyre not the same	They bisect each other	sd	4
for that one was nad		b	4
homestretch last one		b	4
How come	Because its theyre the same triangle	sd	5
What was that	Verticle	sd	4
Close	Theyre opposite inauidble	sd	1
Wait did I draw that wrong	No you drew it Right	aa	1
No you drew it Right	I know what youre talking about	sd	1
I know what youre talking about	I can see it	sd	1
I can see it	I just dont know	sd	1
I think theyre alternate interiors like this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah that makes more sense right	Yes	b	1
Is the value of the expression greater or less than 45 x 9	I do not think that the first expression is greater than 45 x 9 because in the parenthesis it has 45 x 9 and then it has  50 so I know its going to be less than 45 x 9	sd	5
Look now I just stepped on Oopsie	Did it break	sd	1
Did it break	No	b	1
Bowie	I think it is greater than 45 x 9 because you re basically just doing 45 x 9 and we know the answer to it but then youre adding to it so its going to be greater than 45 x 9	sd	5
Allen	I think yes its greater than	sv	4
I think yes its greater than	Because that its 45 x 9 and then times two	sd	5
Adelle explain number one please	I got yes because of youre going to be subtracting so I could just tell by that that it would be less than 198  212	sv	5
Why is it yes	Its a yes because youre basically taking the answer and minusing the answer it equals zero so it is zero	sd	5
Amanda	Because youre splitting it in half so its not the whole four	sd	5
Yes yes and yes	Can you divide that in half	sd	1
Adelle	The sailboats	sd	4
Declan what did we do with the sailboats	I dont know I wasnt here	sd	1
Yes you were here	What sailboat	sd	3
What sailboat	The sailboat map page we did where we like	sd	4
The sailboat map page we did where we like	Oh that one	ba	1
Oh that one	Oh we made a sailboat from the coordinates on there	sd	4
Did you know before you even finished your sailboat if it was going to be larger or smaller	Yes	b	1
Adrianna	Because of the shape and size of the grid	sd	5
Andrea	Coordinates	sd	4
What two types of coordinates Andrea	X and Yaxis	sd	4
When we make a rule about what	How to enlarge a picture	sd	4
Bethany	Amy is designing a logo for her school club	sd	1
Amy is designing a logo for her school club	She plans to put a trapezoid around the letter RC which stands for Running Club	sd	1
She plans to put a trapezoid around the letter RC which stands for Running Club	Below is the picture of the original trapezoid she drew on the coordinated  grid is at the right	sd	1
Below is the picture of the original trapezoid she drew on the coordinated  grid is at the right	Amy decides she wants to include the school name so she needs to make the trapezoid wider	sd	1
Amy decides she wants to include the school name so she needs to make the trapezoid wider	She does not want it to be taller	sd	1
She does not want it to be taller	She developed a rule to help her fix the drawing Amys rule to follow the first coordinates on this	sd	1
Will that work	No	b	1
Doubling the first coordinate will that work	No	b	1
What coordinate is the first coordinate	We always go across first so the first coordinate would be the across one I think	sd	4
Jose	If Amy used the rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like	sd	1
If Amy used the rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like	Be specific in your description	sd	1
Give me one	Yaxis and Xaxis	sd	4
Another word xavier	Origin	b	4
Adelle	Origin	b	4
Amanda	The zero point	sd	4
The zero point	Coordinates	sd	4
Andrea	X coordinate and Y coordinate	sd	4
What are some other things you can do along with your response that makes your response even better	A model	sd	1
Jace	You could draw a picture	sd	4
Put your pencils down all I want you to do right now is listen	We think the new trapezoid will look wider on the Xaxis	sd	5
We think the new trapezoid will look wider on the Xaxis	Then another thing we think will look different is by being longer than the other half of the trapezoid	sd	5
Then another thing we think will look different is by being longer than the other half of the trapezoid	We also agree with Amys rule because if you double numbers it will make things bigger and she wants it to be wider	sd	5
We also agree with Amys rule because if you double numbers it will make things bigger and she wants it to be wider	Then we think thats going to be something that it may look like	sd	5
I can see a lot of agreeing	I dont agree with the picture but yes	sd	2
Bianca	I like how you used a variety of the math vocabulary when you described what the trapezoid would look like	sd	2
Any other stars	I like how I think it was very descriptive because you said it would be wider on the Xaxis which is true and you described it down here	sd	2
Andrea lets have you share and then were going to move on to the next part	What my table group thought of was we think the new trapezoid will look like it would be stretched out because it doubled a lot the Xaxis	sd	5
What my table group thought of was we think the new trapezoid will look like it would be stretched out because it doubled a lot the Xaxis	We know this because the shape did not go higher it went wider	sd	5
We know this because the shape did not go higher it went wider	If it went higher she would have doubled the Yaxis	sd	5
If it went higher she would have doubled the Yaxis	This makes the Y coordinate stay the same and the X coordinate double to be 10	sd	5
This makes the Y coordinate stay the same and the X coordinate double to be 10	We also know this because double of five is 10	sd	5
Jose give me a star	Good vocab	aa	2
Austin give me a star for Andrea	Its very detailed	sd	2
Amanda a star	It has a lot of description with words and her relation on coordinate and the X coordinate and	sd	2
Allen	That will be zero	sd	4
Yes why	Because zero times anything is zero	sd	5
Jace can you tell me what you and your partner talked about	We thought that it would go on 30 to 14 but then we thought that it was going to be higher maybe like 14 at the end	sd	4
Clarissa where do you think I should drag the C to	104	b	4
You guys agreed	Yes	b	1
Was that at 104	Yes	b	1
Briar	You would need to drag D to 100	sd	4
You would need to drag D to 100	Because the original shape was in that	sd	4
Wesley turn around face the screen	It was in that shape so it had a straight side and it has to line up with 104	sd	5
Uhoh okay	I think were wrong	sd	4
A is going to stay what Allen	00	b	4
Jaxon a comment	I noticed on the last one we dragged the C and D over but Im not sure we drag the other one because its 14 is the way I would do it	sd	5
I noticed on the last one we dragged the C and D over but Im not sure we drag the other one because its 14 is the way I would do it	Yes I was about to point that out	sd	2
Let s go back	But it didn t go forward	sd	4
But it didn t go forward	Oh it might not even	sd	2
Okay so I move this over	But they re the same	sd	4
Okay	It would be 33 24	sd	4
Like that	Yes	b	1
Yes	Now its good	sd	4
Wesley press next	Are we right	sd	1
Bianca	24	b	4
C Cynthia	104	b	4
D Jose	D would be 100	sd	4
E Catalina	It would be in 00	sd	4
Yes	The origin	sd	4
Bianca	Just a little bit I was expecting the Yaxis to change to make it smaller but it didn t	sd	4
Just a little bit I was expecting the Yaxis to change to make it smaller but it didn t	That we missed something it became larger on the Xaxis	sd	4
You were surprised just to see the Y coordinates not change	Yes	b	1
Allen	I feel that it just got wider not taller	sd	4
And why wider Allen	Because we times with	sd	5
Amanda	New coordinates	sd	4
Bianca	Yaxis	sd	4
Andrea	Intersect	sd	4
Briar	Xaxis	aa	4
Xaxis	X coordinate and Y coordinate	sd	4
Andrea	Perpendicular	sd	4
Andrea	Are we getting graded on this	sd	1
Are we ready	Yes	b	1
Ali what does it say	It says Use fraction circle pieces the red circle is the whole	sd	1
It says Use fraction circle pieces the red circle is the whole	Make two different combinations of fractions that the pieces that form one	sd	1
Make two different combinations of fractions that the pieces that form one	Get each combination write in fraction or addition	sd	1
Eli do you want to start with something like what kind of fractions you want to add	Onetwo	sd	4
One half	Yes	b	1
Did we make a whole circle	Yes	b	1
We have one half right	Yes	b	1
Following me	Yes	b	1
Could I write any number sentence using these fractions	Yes	b	1
Martin we use our model what does that equal	Three fours	sd	4
Haley what do you think	I think it equals one whole	sd	4
Why do you think it equals one whole	Because the two fours and one equals to two	sd	5
One half	One half	sd	4
One half	They both cover one piece of the whole one side of the whole	sd	4
Thats what you did to prove it	Sure	b	1
Do you think it equals one whole	Yes	b	1
Did I cover if I were to look at this do they cover the whole thing	Yes	b	1
If we were talking pizza if half of the pizza and went back and got a fourth and then another fourth did I eventually eat the whole pizza	Yes	b	1
Whatever I do to the bottom	Add it to the top	sd	4
Do we agree	Yes	b	2
What kind of fraction could we cover that with	Eighth	sd	4
Jahaira says four eighths	If you put them on top the circles and	sd	4
If you put them on top the circles and	If you put the other one	sd	4
Ill show you something different I dont know why it wont let us add a six	Three	sd	4
Three	10	b	2
Are these tests	Yes	b	1
Yes	We need a whole	sd	4
What fraction were those pieces	One threes	sd	1
Let me ask you is this statement true four eighths plus five tenths equals one whole	Yes	b	1
Do you agree with that	Yes	b	2
Does my picture prove it	Id say if you put in on top of the circle it wont make a whole because its	sd	4
What do you think Judith	48 is the same as 12	sd	4
Do you agree with that	Yes	b	2
Do you agree that five tenths is the same as one half	Yes	b	1
12  12	Two halfs	sd	4
Equals	Whole	sd	4
You dont get the what	The bottom part	sd	3
Youre going to working on the sheets	Byebye journal	sd	1
You have to say Yes Emmanuel or do you have to say No its not going to work	Does she have to be in that land	sd	1
What do you think from the question	Yes	b	1
Yes	her house	sd	1
No she says that she wants to divide it among her three daughters so shes not included in the division of the land	She wont have anymore land	sd	1
Think of the way to use fractions to divide the land	Whats a diagram again	sd	3
Sonia	Its somewhere where it tells you where it say  almost like a diagram  where it shows you where the nose or the  something where it is	sd	4
If were drawing a diagram of the land we might have a picture of the land and slice it up depending on who get which piece	Can we put names	sd	4
Can we put names	Can we give the daughters name because I want to show which ones which	sd	4
That will work	Okay	b	1
Okay go ahead	Is she a queen	sd	1
Yes shes a queen	Okay I hate this	sd	1
Ali why do you say no	Because the oldest daughter gets like half the land then the third daughter will get like a a third the other one will get 110 of the land	sd	5
Why do you say that	Because if its in thirds it has some in the middle like on the bottom  theyll only get a little piece	sd	5
Because if its in thirds it has some in the middle like on the bottom  theyll only get a little piece	But its a half	sd	2
Ali say it again	12 would take up half of the 13	sd	4
This is supposed to be her piece of the land but half of it is getting given to the older sister	Its not going to be even	sd	5
Its not going to be even	Because if they are three and one of them is supposed to get half of it and one of them is supposed to get a whole of 13 then the other one is supposed to get another one but it cant be even she cant do that	sd	5
Yes Renada	I proved it because it is bigger than  because 12  13  13 does not equal a whole	sd	5
What does it equal	It equals more than full and it equals	sd	4
In order to add my fractions together which one do you choose	denominator to another number	sd	4
What do I need to do to two to turn it into six Emanuel	You need to add 13	sd	4
Whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	sd	4
Whats our numerator	Three	sd	4
We are going to multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
Renada	Seven	sd	4
Seven	76	b	4
Is that figure then a whole	Yes	b	1
Actually can Queen Ann split her land that way	No	b	1
And the oldest daughter she wants to get more than what the other two daughters have	She can	sd	4
What are the fractions	This	sd	1
How much does each one get	Daughter one	sd	4
Do you feel like you need to talk about it	Yes	b	1
Jade tell me how you did this or whats your thoughts	How I did it is basically I did 12  28  24 because the oldest should have like in this part and then the youngest one can have the green part	sd	5
You took the yellow part and you just had one yellow part Jade	No I had two	sd	4
Okay look at this if I have two yellow parts	But then we had a pink and  the youngest gave two of the blues on top of the yellow	sd	5
Jahaira says she has another way Jahaira what did you do	How I did it was I know that the queen is going to get a half and then from the dark blue I got four because I know that the two little girls are supposed to get 13 from the smallest one and the bigger has to get two because they are going to be the bigger	sd	5
You said	One for the  the other for the other little girl and then two for the big girls	sd	4
Are they equivalent	Yes	b	1
Emanuel	The girls did actually get 23 but  said in 12	sd	4
So the queen got 12 queen has 12 and then	24	b	4
How many sisters are there	Three	sd	4
You got confused on the queen part	Are we supposed to be doing on the	sd	1
Okay did you come up with this you were able to divide it up like this	Yes	b	1
Hold on one second to that did you have a hard time coming up with this	No	b	1
Yes	We didnt know how big the total  should get because maybe they are not even	sd	4
Because why say that again	Because we didnt know if the girls could share one but we can see that the smallest ones can bring a lot of space for the two girls	sd	5
What fractions are we adding here what is my fraction equation that you wrote Caleb	12  14  18  18	b	5
What is the lowest number they have in common	They all have eight	sd	4
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
I do to the top	One times eight	sd	4
What do I need to do to four to make it eight	2 x 2	sd	4
Whatever I do the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
Eight eighths which is the same as one half did we prove it	Yes	b	1
How do you feel	Good	ba	1
Do you think Queen Ann is going to be happy about your suggestion	Yes	b	1
Do you think so	She gets more than	sd	4
So the title youre writing on your page today is square numbers	Uhoh	b	1
Its just a microphone thatll pick up because were recording okay	Okay	b	1
Should have been pretty big in third grade	Oh I remember how to do this in	sd	1
Do you remember hearing the word	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	In Con Academy	sd	1
Let me draw a picture of one and you tell me what you think	I forgot about it	sd	1
I forgot about it	Its been so long	sd	1
Its been so long	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Thats a three by three array	sd	4
Its a three by three array	Oh yeah now I remember	b	1
Okay you might have labeled this a three by three right	And actually what labels are is easy	sd	1
Now if I asked you how many dots were in there	Three times three	sd	4
So maybe something like this	Three times three is nine	sd	4
Have you heard of multiplication before	Yes	b	1
Okay great raise your hand if youve heard of multiplication before	In my math lessons	sd	4
Okay	Imagine	sd	4
Did you hear it last year	Yes	b	1
So now you were still in third grade last year right	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Multiplication is when you multiply a number with another number	sd	4
How did you figure out how many dots were here	Added like three groups of three	sd	4
Did anybody else do that	Yeah	b	2
And then what did you do	Count them	sd	4
Count them	Then add it	sd	2
Counted how	By threes	sd	4
And then tell me what youre doing okay	Ooh	sd	1
Ooh	Thats a big dot right there	sd	1
So how many dots are there		b	4
Ricardo what do you think	Counting by five	sd	4
Olando whatd you do	I did	sd	1
Okay	I did was count how many dots were there first and then count how many groups they were then I knew there was five then I counted five again because it was five in total	sd	5
I did was count how many dots were there first and then count how many groups they were then I knew there was five then I counted five again because it was five in total	And I knew five times five was 25	sd	5
Am I going to get the same answer	Yeah	b	1
Are you following me	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Arrays are my favorite	sd	1
Are we ready	Yeah	b	1
Okay are you sure	Yeah	b	1
Okay what kind of array is that	Two by three	sd	4
Did you have to count them	No	b	1
Hm did you even have to count by twos	No	b	1
No thats one of those patterns those dot patterns that were really used to seeing right	Yeah	b	1
When I think of this if I were to connect these dots  sit up what shape would I get	Square	b	4
Do we agree	Yes	b	1
What kind of array is this	A three by three	sd	4
This is a three by three	The one that we did in the first place	sd	4
If I connected my dots and I drew perfectly would this also be a square	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Lets do What kind of array is this	Four by four	sd	4
Would you say if connected that this would also make a square	Yes	b	1
How many dots are here		b	4
16 dots right	And theres another square in the middle of it	sd	4
A million by a million	What	ba	1
What	A trillion by sixtillion	sd	1
So that when I go ahead and turn it into a square or put it into an array and close it up I actually get	A square	b	4
Are you following me	Yes	b	1
Julia how do they connect	The dots are the groups you times your groups	sd	4
How is multiplication related to addition	You can solve multiplication by using division	sd	4
Not division	No I mean you can solve multiplication using addition	sd	4
Its just repeated addition right	Yeah	b	1
Its like us adding a group plus a group plus a group plus a group right	Yeah	b	1
Is there something else were really good at counting by	I can count by twos	sd	4
Can you guys count by two	Yeah	b	1
Thats something weve been practicing for a while right	Yes	b	1
Owen	Fives	sd	4
By fives okay we did fives	Tens	sd	4
We did twos we did fives	We can do six	sd	4
What		b	4
Tens can you count by tens	Yeah	b	1
So thats skip counting do you remember them calling it skip counting	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	No	b	1
You guys used skip counting when you were thinking of the threes right	Yeah	b	1
We could skip count by sevens if we wanted to right	We could skip count by 10 quintillion	sd	4
Were probably not memorized as well but if we did seven it would say seven and then		b	4
		b	4

12		b	4
You ready to try some work on your own	Yeah	b	1
These two numbers that were using to determine our array theyre called factors	Oh yeah	b	1
I dont know what page it is	What page	sd	1
I dont know	Oh I found it	sd	1
What page	I just passed it	sd	1
Were looking at lesson 21	I found it	sd	1
Page 35	35	b	1
All right on page 35 are you	No not yet	sd	1
No not yet	I got it	sd	1
	Found it	sd	1
What was the next	A one by one	sd	4
No they already showed us one by one two by two three by three four by four	Five by five	sd	4
Five by five and the one after that would be	Six by six	sd	4
They just want you	To do a square	sd	4
But go ahead and peek at page 36	Wait which page	sd	1
Aldo what is a fraction	A fraction is a half	sd	4
Its a fraction always a half	No	b	1
Meredith	A fraction is a number of something	sd	4
A number of something so if I say I have four dogs is that a fraction	No	b	1
Whats a fraction Andie	Its something divided into a whole and I feel like its so we could measure it  Each person get equal parts like if somebody gets 14 theres three more people that could share that	sd	5
Why is that a hexagon Miranda	Because a hexagon has six faces	sd	5
Six what	Sides	sd	4
Six what	Six sides	sd	4
Arden	Because	sd	1
Could you say that at one more time Arden	If you fill it up like this	sd	4
If you fill it up with your blues then you have how many blue pieces covering up the whole	Three	sd	4
Miranda	Because 23 is when if you take away third its 13	sd	5
Table two please take away 500 points	Its like a hexagon  23 its	sd	4
So if I know what 13 is could I figure out what 23 are	Yes	b	1
What did you find	I found that I would remove a third again but I put green	sd	4
Two blues is equal to 23 what are my greens equal to Natasha	16	b	4
16 why Natasha	Because you used six pieces to fill up the hexagon and one of them equals 16	sd	5
Did everyone hear what Natasha just said	Yes	b	1
Ash	She said a hexagon is  six and then one always gives 16	sd	2
How many is one equal to	16	b	4
Noelle can you tell me what one 12 is	One 12 is this one	sd	4
What is that one cSSed	I dont know I forgot	sd	1
I dont know I forgot	A trapezoid	sd	4
Ashton what did you find	46	b	4
Does everyone agree with Ashton	Yes	b	2
What does my sixth look like Rebecca	A sixth looks like a whole hexagon	sd	4
Weve just talked about that	Triangles	sd	4
You get way too caught up in the numbers when you guys can show me that you know why 23 and 46 are	equal	b	4
Clay what was your favorite fraction that you saw	We got 86000 2	sd	4
We got 86000 2	You didnt know	sd	2
You didnt know	200000 300000	b	4
200000 300000	For sure	sd	2
Okay I will teach you in a bit	Yes thats coming off	sd	1
Oh  what did you see	20 million 30 million	sd	4
Hey Todd will you read our learning intentions for today	Yes I can explain why the multiplication rule for equivalent fractions works	sd	1
What word does the answer usually have in it	Oh can we say Why	sd	1
No	Because	sd	1
Didnt you guys ever play that game with your mom	No	b	1
When you are explaining something you would explain the multiplication rule for equivalent fractions works	Because	sd	1
because Then as we can see here Do you guys remember this rule	Yes	b	1
Paige will you read the	Success	sd	1
success criteria please	I will go on successful with my answer to number 2C on page 184 is clear specific and concise	sd	1
If an explanation is clear Clay what does it mean	If its clear theres no more mistaking it Miss Esther	sd	4
What does specific mean Nessa	Very detailed	sd	4
You might	Write your systems of accomplishing	sd	4
T	Enough vocabulary	aa	4
That would be specific	Not Pacific	sd	1
Not Pacific	To be specific can you say Label	sd	1
Youre given	Why cant you be on	sd	3
To be specific you might give an example right	Yes	b	1
Fred what does concise mean	Just like	sd	1
I however am not usually concise in my explanation	Maybe to be more specific	sd	4
Why do Ms Gibsons look like concise answers	Because its clear	sd	4
What does concise mean	Concise means  likes to be concise	sd	4
Concise means  likes to be concise	Concise means its only its way	sd	4
River what do you think concise means	For me it would mean target to the point	sd	4
I want you to tell me what I want to know in as few words as possible but you also need to be clear and specific okay	Thats a lot	sd	1
Thats a lot	Yes	b	1
The multiplicative identity property is not something you have to memorize but you need to understand it	Can I read it	sd	1
Yes please	If any number is multiplied by one the product is that number	sd	1
Is that news to anybody	No	b	1
Are any of you thinking that Oh yes of course that is the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions right	Yes	b	1
Bruce will you read the instructions	Complete the following	sd	1
Complete the following	Prepare to explain your thinking	sv	1
Now	You dont have a pencil	sd	1
What do you notice about all those problems Asher	That they all have Theyre all multiplying them	sd	4
Youre multiplying what	Multiplying them by another number	sd	4
Tera	Youre multiplying a whole number by a fraction	sd	4
What did you have to think about Mariah	I had to think about when I multiplied the fraction by a fraction	sd	4
I had to think about when I multiplied the fraction by a fraction	Well when I multiplied the fraction by a whole number at first I thought that	sd	4
Are you listening	Oh but it starts out with five and then	sd	4
Oh but it starts out with five and then	Then I had to think about how you multiply a fraction by a whole number is always less than the product	sd	4
What are we multiplying by there	Thirds	sd	4
What is the answer	The answer is 5 x 2	sd	4
How do you know that	Because its a whole fraction	sd	5
It is	How I thought of it 5 x 2  10 and thats already bigger than 5 so you dont even need to do 5 x 1	sd	5
Youre multiplying by more than 1 right	Yes	b	1
Dean what do you think	I think its more than because 54 over a whole	sd	5
Awesome job	I think theres another one	sd	4
Are there more	Yes theres one more	sd	4
Yes theres one more	Im pretty sure that was  because 5 x 1  5	sd	5
Everybody say it	Multiplicative identity property	sd	1
give me one	12  12	b	4
Alexa give me one	44	b	4
Sarah	2525	b	4
Stella	66	b	4
Asher	93 93	b	4
Royce	10001000	b	2
What do you notice about the numerator and denominator	Theyre the Deane	sd	4
22 right	Yes	b	1
Then Im multiplying by what	20	b	4
This is 20ths right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Does everybody understand that all we are doing is multiplying by 1	Yes	b	1
Where the	The denominator and the numerator is equal	sd	4
Am I clear	Yes	b	1
I would like If you feel like you need some extra support with this I will be working at the back table so did this	Yes	b	1
So youre looking for a small numerator does that tell you that you have a smaller fraction	Yeah	b	1
Wyatt go for it	Basically Im just looking for a high denominator and a low numerator	sd	4
Basically Im just looking for a high denominator and a low numerator	Because if the denominators high and the numernate whats it called	sd	3
Numerator	Numerators small then basically you have a pretty small number	sd	4
Theodore do you want to go for it	Should I just tell the answer	sd	1
Which two numbers would you pick	I would pick 110 and 16	sd	4
So Leo can you tell us what is a strategy that we might be able to use to solve this problem	So with the bottom number I forget which one it is numerators or	sd	3
Numerators on top denominators on the bottom	With the denominator you want to find two numbers that and for the top one you want to find something thats going to equal half of that	sd	4
Sammie is there anything you feel like we could eliminate	Yeah 910 because it exceeds what we need	sd	5
Okay anything else we can eliminate Rose	78	b	4
How come	For the same reason	sd	2
Arriana do you see anything else we can eliminate because it already exceeds what were looking for	Possibly 48 because its already half	sd	5
Theodore what are you thinking	110 because its definitely too little	sd	5
Well we might add 110 to something later	Oh we can add	sd	1
Yeah Carter whats up	Cross out 48 if it sums out to be one half	sd	5
Mack since I have you are there any other cards we can eliminate that are more than one half	Im thinking 110	sd	4
Well we could add 110 to something else Theodore do you see what we could eliminate	34	b	4
Hunter what are your thoughts	I dont know if this goes over or not but 38 and 16	sd	4
So Hunter which are the two you wanted to try and add together	16 and 38	sd	4
Valarie your brain is just going going whats up	Would 24 be one	sd	4
So 1324 what do you guys think about that	Its close	sd	4
One fraction whats the size of that fraction	Its 124 away	sd	4
I see youve got your hand Arriana what are you thinking	40	b	4
How close is that one	140	b	4
Are you there Julia	Yeah sorry I think 1940 is going to be closer to one half	sd	4
Yeah what are you thinking Hunter	The problem says to circle the two numbers who	sd	4
Did we circle the two numbers whos sum is closest to one half without equaling one half	Yes	b	1
Was I right	Yeah	b	1
Did you hear somebody say that	Thats what we said	sd	1
Whats a number that we can count by threes and we can count by fives and theyll land on the same number	15	b	4
So 1615 Theodore	Can I tell the answer to the whole	sd	1
Sure	It would be 14 and 115	sd	4
Yeah Hunter	I feel I lost track of what were doing	sd	3
I feel I lost track of what were doing	How did you get three and one	sd	3
Arriana what do you think		b	4
What did I multiply by	Multiply by six	sd	4
To get from six to 18 Hunter what did I multiply by	Three	sd	4
Julia what should I do next	Sorry I know you asked me a question but you cut out I only heard my name	sd	1
What are we going to do next	Next we are going to I would make it into a mixed fraction	sd	4
No three plus five	Five plus three is eight	sd	5
And then whats 1218 plus 1518	So that would be 27	sd	4
What should we do next Sammie	You should probably get that 27 down to a non whats it called	sd	3
How many times will 18 go into 27	Once it wouldnt go twice	sd	4
Yep and then what would be left over	Four	sd	4
Well Im going to count up from 18 to 27	Sorry 10	b	4
Yeah Sammie do you want to take this one	It would be nine and one half	sd	4
And thats our final answer for this sum	I just wanted to point out one thing	sd	1
I just wanted to point out one thing	In the very first thing we did how we thought the common factor was 18 sorry common multiple was 18	sd	4
In the very first thing we did how we thought the common factor was 18 sorry common multiple was 18	Another common multiple that I think would have been a little simpler was just six	sd	4
Wyatt P what do you think that a common multiple between five and eight could be	40	b	4
Juniper what do I need to multiply five by in order to get to 40	Eight	aa	4
So we have 3240 and Julia what are we going to multiply 58 by	By five	sd	4
Okay Arriana help me add these together	So you add two and 10 which would be 12 then if you added the two numerators you would get 57	sd	5
So you add two and 10 which would be 12 then if you added the two numerators you would get 57	But its a reverse number so you have to do	sd	5
So 5740	And then I did 57 minus 40 to get my answer and I got 17	sd	5
Okay keep going	And that would be 13 and	sd	4
Okay I want you guys to try number three independently	T	b	1
T	So I get everything else Im just confused of once you have 12 and 57 how that goes to 12 plus 17 over 40	sd	3
Does that help you out Valarie	Yes	b	1
Yeah Hunter	Im confused so I get how you do two and four is 12 and then you add the five and the eight and then you add two more that would be 14	sd	5
Im confused so I get how you do two and four is 12 and then you add the five and the eight and then you add two more that would be 14	But then how do you And then you times five times eight and eight times five but then what do you do after that really	sd	3
But basically I have to add my numerators but keep my denominators the same and dont add those together	Oh	b	1
Yeah Harmony	Can you hear me	sd	1
Yeah I can hear you	Okay I was just wondering because Im a little bit confused on the part where you put it that way and then its 12 plus one 17th and 40th	sd	3
Okay I was just wondering because Im a little bit confused on the part where you put it that way and then its 12 plus one 17th and 40th	I dont know how to get that	sd	3
Does that make sense	Okay yeah it does but I was working on number three and then I got 19 over	sd	4
Yeah lets look at this one you guys ready to tackle this one	So would it just be that and the	sd	1
So one two three		b	4
What would that be crew		b	4
And then lets add our fractions together and what would we get		b	4
Do you guys have any questions about that one	Miss I get everything except how we do the nine over 24 and ten	sd	3
You mean like how we got to those equivalent fractions	Yeah	b	1
Oh okay then whats your question sorry	I dont get how you got the nine over 24 and the 10 over 24	sd	3
Not really	Not really	sd	3
Can you ask it and maybe someone else can help me out	I just dont understand how you got seven and 924 plus five with 1024	sd	3
Does somebody think they can explain it to Aubree	I can explain it	sd	1
Yeah Valarie go for it	So basically so youre finding the lowest common factor of both numbers	sd	4
The lowest common multiple yep	And since eight and 12 both go into 24 and its the lowest one then you times that and the numerator by it	sd	5
And since eight and 12 both go into 24 and its the lowest one then you times that and the numerator by it	And then you	sd	1
And then you	Oh okay	b	1
Hey Valarie I think you should have my job	No yeah thank you	aa	1
And then I guess tomorrow well tackle subtraction	Can I say I relearnt	sd	1
Yes okay	Thats cool	ba	1
Is there an  can I get one too	Yes it works	sd	1
All the information we could need	Yes can everybody get a paper	sd	1
Yes can everybody get a paper	No	b	1
What is it Anna	Nick and Tasha are buying supplies for a camping trip	sd	1

25	25 my bad	sd	2
You said one and a half where it should be 12	One half	sd	1
Is 12 and how much	25	b	4
Read part A and figure out what answer youre going to be looking for	Do we solve it	sd	1
Do we solve it	We dont	sd	1
We dont	She said we could do it	sd	1
She said we could do it	Im sure I can solve it	sd	1
You could underline any important words	Do we solve it	sd	1
Tell me Damien what information do we need to know	What fraction of the chocolate bar will Nick and Tasha use in total	sd	4
Whats the important part about that	How much in total	sd	4
Luke	I also circled fractions part	sd	2
Rita	only one of the fractions	sd	4
Rita can you repeat yourself please	One is also  in our fraction	sd	2
Thank you	Easy to do	sd	1
Caroline	One chocolate bar	sd	4
JD	That they will get the right amount	sd	4
Dylan	Dang it I just remembered it and then it just went poof	sd	1
Thats okay	They each tried to get how many pieces they could	sd	4
Then theres one other Isaiah	It says that Nick wants to cut one chocolate bar into pieces of equal size	sd	4
Bella	Equal size	sd	4
Lauren	How much should he get and how much she could give to Tasha	sd	4
Is your answers going to be a fraction	Yes	b	1
Read it again tell me if your answer is going to be a fraction	Yes	b	1
Adam	How may pieces	sd	4
How many pieces so your answer is going to be	Fractions	aa	4
Fractions	Fractions	aa	2
Riley	Do every question	sd	4
What else do you have to do to be successful as a mathematician on this problem	You have to know how many pieces	sd	4
Adam	Estimate	sd	4
What else	To show your work and draw a model	sd	4
Heres what I want	You want a model	sd	4
What am I going to tell those people	Show your work so you know	sv	4
Lauren	Its going to be easier for other people to see your work who dont really get it if you show your work more because then theres  other people are looking at it and they dont really  because you just do it in your head	sv	5
Its going to be easier for other people to see your work who dont really get it if you show your work more because then theres  other people are looking at it and they dont really  because you just do it in your head	They dont know how you got your answer	sd	5
They dont know how you got your answer	Theyre going to just think  Oh	sd	5
Gale what do you think	When theTmarks it you have	sd	4
Eliza	Showing your work if you just do it in your mind then you might forget something but writing down what you know can help	sd	5
Anna	To add on to Elizas even if you know what it is you should draw a model just so that you know  right	sd	2
Sawyer	To have  the candy bar the last part of it	sd	1
To have  the candy bar the last part of it	Its like they have	sd	1
Have a label	Yes have a label	sd	1
Yes have a label	They all have a label	sd	1
Rita	I have	sd	1
Wyatt	When you showed your work  if you want to write what you did	sd	4
When you showed your work  if you want to write what you did	Explain	b	3
Explain	Then you also have to learn good math grammar	sd	4
Part of the explain as Sawyer said is math vocab	Are you supposed to write how we did on the back of it	sd	1
What questions do you have	Do we really have to answer A B C  by themselves	sd	1
Caroline	Can we do it on the back	sd	1
Damien	Where is the	sd	1
Then you explain	Yes	b	1
Can you  Morgan gets back	Yes	b	1
If you guys  go after Morgan	The sensor works on the water problems	sd	4
Is anybody else going to the	No	b	1
That piece can be	No	b	1
No	I havent had	sd	1
Are we all on task	Yes	b	1
Were going to take four more minutes	Four more minutes	sd	1
I mean to discuss	Im only on number one	sd	1
We are going to share our thinking	Why does that keep on	sd	1
Explain your thinking	Part A I did 12 is 25	sd	5
Part A I did 12 is 25	I did that 2x510 and 410  equals to 12 and 45 is 9 so thats 910	sd	5
Sawyer what do you think about Riley got 910 what do you think about that	I was putting away my	sd	1
What do you think about that	I agree with her	sd	2
I agree with her	First I did 2x5 it was 10 and then I knew that 12 of a 10 was 510 and then 25t of 10 would be 410 so I did 5410 would be 910 of your candy bar	sd	5
Blake	but that didnt work out so then I used my fraction circle and I used my circles to  and I figured out that five of them	sd	5
Dylan	I have a question because I thought we were only supposed to solve A B and C but I dont get how they got 910 when its 15	sd	3
Can someone answer that JD	In order to add the fractions you have to give them the same denominators so thats why we multiplied and then found the 910	sd	5
What were the two fractions we were adding	12 and 25	sd	4
They made them 110 so they have a common denominator	Okay	b	1
Does that make sense now	Yes	b	1
Dylan I liked that you asked that question thank you very much	Youre welcome	sd	1
Then part B Henly	I drew a chocolate bar and I split it into 110 because I knew  110 equally and then I knew I have 12 could go into 110 overall	sd	5
What was your answer Henly	To 10 pieces	sd	4
JD	If you said 110 is that equal to 10 pieces	sd	4
You should two answers for C right	I got two only	sd	4
How many times	It should be this and this	sd	4
How many pieces of the chocolate bar should he get and how many pieces of a chocolate bar should he give to Tasha	Its nine	sd	4
Molly	For C	sd	1
For C	My answer is  explaining	sd	1
Thats perfect thats fine	I wrote Nick should give 4 and 12 to himself and 4 and 12 to Tasha because there are 910 of the bar so you divide them equally among 2 people	sd	5
I wrote Nick should give 4 and 12 to himself and 4 and 12 to Tasha because there are 910 of the bar so you divide them equally among 2 people	2 94 12 so Nick and Tasha will get 4 12 of the chocolate	sd	5
How many times is that	Four and one	sd	4
510 so how many pieces would Nick get	510	b	4
25 is how many tenths	410	b	4
How many pieces would Tasha get	Four pieces	sd	4
I would like someone to respond to Mollyn and that person who would like to respond is number 24	I heard Mollyn say	sd	2
I heard Mollyn say	Can you say that again	sd	1
in one minute	Could you say that	sv	1
Jake	I agree with Mollyn because once I added or  but once I got 1225 I figured out that Tasha would get 14 and Nick would get 15	sd	2
Itd be 410 and 510 right	Yes	b	1
All right youre going to title your notes today Just division	Nice I can write it big	sd	1
Alright Melanie tell us what division is	Division is basically backwards multiplication	sd	4
What else do we know about division Arethra	Its kind of like similar to subtraction	sd	4
Its kind of like similar to subtraction	Because like when you divide something you get small numbers and what you started with but its also kinda related to multiplication	sd	5
Jose T what do you know about division	is the opposite of it  Its the opposite of multiplication to and the same as a subtraction	sd	4
Brady what do you know about division	I know that its	sd	1
I know that its	So you take one number say like 12 Then you divide it by two And thats going to be I think two	sv	5
You guys see this Okay	Yes	aa	1
okay sweet	T	b	1
Yes Arethra	Why dont they have the same name for example factors in the multiplication problem	sd	3
Why dont they have the same name for example factors in the multiplication problem	They both have the same name but in Division both numbers have a different name	sd	3
Does anyone think they know the answer to Arethras question	I think	sv	1
okay Mabel what do you think	I think its different Because they should have the same name because some are very different equations to what youre learning	sd	5
So our dividend shows us how many we started with so 12 12345101112 and were breaking it up into how many groups	two	sd	4
And how many are in each group	Six	b	4
If instead of making them into two groups I divide them all up into groups of two	I dont think youre inauidble	sv	4
I dont think youre inauidble	And youre not going to get the um Youre not going to get a different answer	sd	2
Why not	I think that you are going to get a different answer	sv	4
Okay lets see	Youre gonna get a different answer	sd	4
Youre gonna get a different answer	Oh wait	sd	1
Oh wait	youre going to get the same answer because I did the math	sd	2
youre going to get the same answer because I did the math	And there were there were six groups of two	sd	4
Do we agree that theres going to be six groups of two Braxton	I agree with Brady are there I dont how to explain	sd	2
I agree with Brady are there I dont how to explain	I did the math I think it is six	sd	2
Count them with me	123	b	1
because all were doing or Im sorry Arethra	I think I know	sv	1
Okay tell me	because its like when you I do two groups of six you get the answer 12 and two groups and six groups of two you also get the answer 12	sd	5
Does anybody know what the answer to a division problem is	I think I know	sv	1
What is the vocabulary word	I think the vocabulary word is division	sd	4
I think the vocabulary word is division	I dont know	sd	3
anybody think they know what the answer to a division problem is	I think I know	sv	1
what is it	answer	sd	4
What is the answer to an addition problem	Sum	sd	4
What is the answer to a subtraction problem	Difference	sd	4
difference What about a multiplication problem	Product	sd	4
Youre telling me that people know all three of those that nobody knows what the answer to a division problem is	Sum	sd	4
Sum	Yes	b	2
It is a quotient	Like a quotation mark	sd	4
All right Eden can you tell us your your idea for a game	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	My game is that you pick a stick and whoevers name lands on it types to you in the chat for the question and then we try to solve it	sd	1
Alright Bruce go	How I solved this problem is is is I I was thinking about multiplication and then I multiplied it Four times five	sd	5
How I solved this problem is is is I I was thinking about multiplication and then I multiplied it Four times five	And then and then I got and then that equals 20  so and then there was a five in it so so I knew the answer was four	sd	5
Did anyone do the same thing as Bruce	I did it a different way	sd	2
I did it a different way	I did it the same but inauidble	sd	2
I heard a couple	I did it the same way too	sd	2
Braxton how did you do it	Um I so I put I put like in my mind of like 20 dots	sd	5
Um I so I put I put like in my mind of like 20 dots	And then I put five groups and then theres four groups	sd	5
And then I put five groups and then theres four groups	So I knew it was four	sd	5
Braxton you got the same answer as Bruce right	Yeah yeah	b	2
So	All right people we need to get focused here	sd	
All right people we need to get focused here	Mr G does that number always have to go up at an even rate	sd	4
Yes	Can it go over two of one and then over two of two	sd	4
This is your last homework of this semester	Oh yes baby	aa	1
Matias	05	b	4
Anybody write the rate of change a different way	12	b	4
Otis	12	b	4
Did that help a little bit with your question	A little bit but which one is rise and which one is run	sd	3
Rise is up and down so its a vertical line and run is the side to side	All right that helps	sd	1
All right that helps	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	I have a question	sd	1
I have a question	Is it possible for both rise and run to be negative in a regular graph	sd	4
Whos got an equation	No I dont have an equation but why is it 1	sd	3
Because its going down from left to right	If its going up	sd	1
Because this is a 3 and this is a 12	You could do this 3  12	sd	4
You know what you got this for	Could you also put the three in front	sd	4
Who can help us out with this one	is not a solution	sd	4
is right there is on the line	No	b	1
Thank you Ivanna	Yes	b	1
10 is X 2 is Y Im going to replace X with 10 and 2 with Y	5	b	4

Whats 15  3	45	b	4
Is that the same as this	No	b	1
If X is 14 lets solve for Y	7	b	4
7 3	10	b	4
7  3	4	b	4
Does everybody agree	Yes	b	2
Does that make sense that its	Yes	b	1
Micha	Well if every time the Y goes up X goes up	sd	5
Well if every time the Y goes up X goes up	No if every time the Y goes 1 the X goes 2 then we could just 10 Nevermind	sd	5
Well talk about that a little bit more today	what X is	sd	3
What do you think it is	I think its 31	sv	4
Is that what you did	Probably	sd	1
Marshall	Is it 26	sd	4
Is not 26 but youre close as well	Oh 13	b	4
Oh 13	Oh its negative	sd	4
What did you say	14	b	4
Lets see why its 14	14	b	4
14 yes	Why is it correct	sd	3
10  12 x 14  3 okay	Oh I did it backwards	sd	1
Oh I did it backwards	Seven	sd	4

Do you think that line would connect to this point	Yes	b	1
Everybody ready	Yes	b	1
What do you call a dinosaur with an extensive vocabulary	I dont know Mr G	sd	1
I dont know Mr G	What	ba	1
A thesaurus rex	Mr Gene my jokes better	sd	1
Tell it to me after class okay	I will	sd	1
Option number one is theres help session tomorrow morning	There is	sd	1
Whats that	Google	aa	1
Micha and	For number two or Y and B in the equation do I have to write Y equals	sd	4
You should always have the Y equals part	Would it be correct without	sd	1
An equation needs an equal sign in it so if you dont have the equals sign then you only have part of the equation	What if its a	sd	1
Miles	For line A Y are proportional and linear circled	sd	4
Its proportional so when it says circle one I think the best answer is proportional	Its also linear	sd	4
If its proportional its also definitely linear	Right	b	1
Niki	For the equations is it always going to be Y equals or whatever the dependent variable is	sd	3
Okay	When the dependent is the	sd	1
The amount of money depends on how far the walk the distance	Oh okay	b	1
Okay	Yes	b	1
Ivanna	On line C is it okay if I wrote Y X  5 or is that not correct	sd	4
X  5 would mean that its going up by 1 every time	Okay	b	1
You can write Y 0X  5	Oh I did that	sd	1
Oh I did that	That works	aa	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Nova	For those graphs up there theyre all the same but mine was different	sd	4
For those graphs up there theyre all the same but mine was different	Were we supposed to meet all the graphs is the same	sd	1
I try to make it so you could go up by ones but you didnt want to go by ones thats fine	Do they have to be the same	sd	1
Because it says label each axis for each one so its whatever you wanted to do could work	Okay	b	1
Melvin	Where it shows W but couldnt you also do X even its only becoming from the same number here	sd	4
Sure	Yes I like to put X in sometimes	sd	1
It might not be as accurate for that situation but its still the equation	If that was on the final do we have to write it under the	sd	1
You should try to use	per week	sd	1
Thats a little bit more drastic	But it says four weeks	sd	1
Say theyre getting paid every day then Kaia would have more money	were setting this up per week	sd	4
Yes	Because like at the end of  you get paid after	sd	1
This one the nice thing	It just gives the Yintercept	sd	4
The Yintercept is  ld like you to write that in on your page	Can we write the seven on the third one	sd	1
What does it go up by for Y	Three	sd	4
Goes up by three	Do you have to do the 1s	sd	1
Piper what do you think	Y43X	b	4
Ramsey	3x4	b	4
First of all is there a Yintercept in there	No	b	1
Lets write in our ratios for rise and run	Theres no Yintercept	sd	1
There is but its on the table	No	b	1
Yes because theres no 0 for X right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Should X be seven	aa	4
Down here	Yes	b	1
So X goes up by two here Y goes what	Up by 6	sd	4
Up goes up by 6	No	b	1
X goes up by how many here	2	b	4
2 and up by	6	b	4
X goes up by	3	b	4
3and y goes up by	9	b	4
9 is that the same ratio	Yes	b	1
26 is the same as 39	Yes	b	1
Okay and then X goes up by	1	b	4
1	3	b	4
Your slope is 31 or you could do 93 or you could do 62 its all the same thing and you get 3 again for your slope	Do you have to break the 31	sd	1
It might not always be the case but it depends	31	b	4
In between the 3 In the 5 we should write 4 SS agree with that	Yes	b	1
Okay what do you think that the Y value is for 2	5	b	4
What do you think the Y value is for 4	11	b	4
Notice how this connects to the slope from 2 to 5 what is it plus what	3	b	4

8 to 11	3	b	4
11 to 14	3	b	4
Ty what do you think	Y3X1	b	4
All right people last table	I wrote it differently	sd	3
How did you write it differently		b	4
What are we going up by here	3	b	4

What are we going up by here	1	b	4
What are we going down by here	2	b	4

Ivanna	It will be 2	sd	4
What would be the Y value here	13	b	4
13	Yes	b	1
What if we work backwards all the way to 0	19	b	4
19	Not 19	sd	4
SS agree with that	Yes	b	2
Yes	Why are you making it go down by 2 because thats the slope	sd	3
Melvin youve got an equation for us	Yes	b	1
Yes	Y 192X	b	4
Have we done I to the L	Yes	b	1
Have we done L and with like	Yes	b	1
Have we done peace up and Aokay	No	b	1
On three we are going to switch	That one is easy	sd	1
That one is easy	I just did it first try	sd	1
Okay three two one switch	I am so good you have no idea	sd	1
Accurate three two one switch	Did you see that	sd	1
Neil are we doing okay	Yes	b	1
Are we doing okay	Yes	b	1
For the first two we are going to use the help of a graph and for the last two were not going to use a graph	Can we use ratio tables for the last two	sd	4
The Yintercept is  and the slope	Is 2	aa	4
Paisley	Y 1  2X	sd	4
Other way slope with the X Y	I said 1  2X	sd	4
Is it how he said	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes thats what he said	sd	2
Can we write 2X  1	Yes	b	1
You can what Paisley said 1  2X or you can do 2X  1	What would happen if we then wrote Y 2X	sd	3
Then that does not account for the Yintercept for you	Then it starts at	sd	4
Instead of  Harriette question	In here it doesnt really matter if you do 1  2X or 2X  1 but like how the dollar sign before the number its not really wrong if you do it after the number but most people do it before	sd	3
In here it doesnt really matter if you do 1  2X or 2X  1 but like how the dollar sign before the number its not really wrong if you do it after the number but most people do it before	Is there a way like that with this	sd	3
First of all is this increasing or decreasing	Decreasing	sd	4
Then could someone help us out why is this problem more challenging than the first problem	Because its easy	sd	1
Melvin why is this one more challenging	We dont know where the Yintercept is	sd	5
Yes you dont know where the	There is a way we can know where it is but its not on the grid	sd	4

Melvin a question	Does it always have to whole numbers	sd	4
No but I think the nice thing about drawing the triangle	I see a 25 first	sd	4
I see a 25 first	Yes I thought it was 25 before I did the	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
We are going to go to 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7	Only up to 7	sd	1
I want to show you the strategy first	I have a strategy	sd	1
I have a strategy	I have a strategy too	sd	1
Does everybody agreed these are our two starting points	Yes	b	2
Then what about this one	Thats 3	ba	4

What	Can I turn my thing back on	sd	1
Merrill	is twothirds of nine is basically whats happened there	sd	4
is twothirds of nine is basically whats happened there	So we could figure out what nine divided by half equals what	sd	4
So if we do nine times twothirds are we going to get a product that is greater than nine	No	b	1
Ollie	We wont get a bigger problem because its lower than one	sd	5
Less than  will the product be greater than twothirds	Yes	b	1
Merrill	Because half of nine is  it should be higher than twothirds because nine is an odd number and because its not even that means that there will be another fraction added onto the nine	sd	5
When we multiply nine times twothirds are we going to get a product thats less than one	Yes	b	1
Yes	Wait	sd	1
Christina	Will be greater than twothirds because youre multiplying the numerator to the nine and that will give you 18	sd	5

Can we keep our voices low	Yes	b	1
Move your desk to your partner	Which partner	sd	1
Who needs a partner	I already have a partner	sd	1
What were you thinking	Find a common denominator	sd	4
Yeah	I think we were taught in fourth grade to just do it like this	sd	4
what do you think	I think it would be 18 and 12 because it was 34 and now theres only two of them so it would be 24 and 24 is equal to 12	sd	5
what do you think	I have a feeling its the exact same thing	sd	2
Yeah Chance	I was thinking maybe it would be 23	sd	4
Because	Since theres 34 and you only have 2 of them	sd	5
Since theres 34 and you only have 2 of them	Then thered be 23 of 34	sd	5
Our second problem Yeah	Couldnt you just do nine times three because its 13 so you would multiply nine times three	sd	5
How come nine times three would work	I dont know but whenever its a whole number thats divided by a fraction thats just one part of a fraction like 13	sd	5
I dont know but whenever its a whole number thats divided by a fraction thats just one part of a fraction like 13	I just multiply the whole number by the denominator	sd	5
Yeah	I think it works because when dividing fractions dividing different pieces you try to figure out how many into the thing like how big it is	sd	5
I think it works because when dividing fractions dividing different pieces you try to figure out how many into the thing like how big it is	For that 34 one you got 18	sd	5
For that 34 one you got 18	Inside of 14 you got 18 because its only 34 of that 14 and youre trying to figure out how many times that 34 can go into that 14	sd	5
Inside of 14 you got 18 because its only 34 of that 14 and youre trying to figure out how many times that 34 can go into that 14	18 times because its bigger	sd	5
18 times because its bigger	You multiply by the denominator its also like dividing the fraction because youre just finding how many times that number goes into another number	sd	5
Stetson what are you thinking	I guess because nine times three equals 27 and theres three pieces in every nine pizzas I guess	sd	5
I guess because nine times three equals 27 and theres three pieces in every nine pizzas I guess	When you multiply three times nine youll get the proper number I guess	sd	4
Mathland what questions do you guys have	I had a question	sd	3
Sure	When its nine divided by 14 do you have to do all the work times four or can you just do nine times the denominator	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
All right crew	I have a question	sd	3
Whats up	Can we use a number line too to find this out or do we have to	sd	4
Absolutely	Okay	b	1
Okay	T	b	1
Yeah Sweetie	Couldnt you just multiply nine times four	sd	4
Do you know why that works	Because its only onesomething	sd	5
Make sure you know why that strategy works	All right	aa	1
Okay	I have another question	sd	3
Sure	Are we just doing how many times can nine go into each one	sd	4
Whats up Deborah	Ive got two	sd	1
Ive got two	I didnt realize I had two	sd	1
What is my division sentence for this one	Would it be 15 divided by 23	sd	4
How does that change your sentence	Oh divided by nine	sd	4
Oh divided by nine	Yeah why is it nine	aa	3
She has nine blocks of cheese	No	b	1
No	I thought we were doing the one under it	sd	1
We have 15 of a block	Okay	b	1
What would your number sentence be	We have nine so would we do nine	sd	4
We have nine so would we do nine	Wait Im a little bit confused	sd	3
What are the size of the pieces were going to divide it into	The size of the pizzas so if we have nine cheese  We have nine pizzas	sd	4
No we have nine blocks of cheese	Nine blocks of cheese divided by 15	sd	4
Whats an algorithm we can use	Im just a little bit confused on the algorithm part	sd	3
Im just a little bit confused on the algorithm part	I dont really get how youre supposed to set it up and stuff	sd	3
If we draw our picture over here Yeah	That makes more sense	sd	4
Whats our division sentence going to be	Nine divided by 23	sd	4
What should we do	Set up	sd	4
Set up	I think you would	sv	1
I think you would	Im sorry	sd	1
Im sorry	Nine over one	sd	4
Sure	Then you have one divided by 23	sd	4
Then you have one divided by 23	Then three is the common denominator	sd	4
Then three is the common denominator	Then three times nine is 27 over three and two over three and then do you do 27 divided by two	sd	5
You absolutely do	Okay	b	1
Which we can also write as 272	Oh	b	1
Yeah Sterling	I was just going to say that its half	sd	4
How do you know that its half	Divided in half of two that was one	sd	5
Divided in half of two that was one	It would be 135	sd	5
Try your model	I think this is the same as that because this  as 23	sv	5
Thats 33	Oh	b	1
Oh	I dont know why I	sd	1
It looks close	Sorry	b	1
Why do you think the division works	I think its just because of how many times a fraction can go into a whole number which is a lot more than it would be if you were just dividing a number by another whole number	sd	5
Flip over to your other page	The first one	sd	1
We started by having three times as many but then we divided them into groups of two	Yeah	b	1
Thats why when you think about it thats why if you flip it it will still work as a strategy	Okay	b	1
Yeah	Do we just count this as one so this would just be 27	sd	4
Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work	I understand why it would work just one of something but I dont see how it would work with 23	sd	3
You have this beautiful diagram here	Yeah so over here 36 I thought would maybe be like	sd	5
Yeah so over here 36 I thought would maybe be like	I thought it would be nine times three because its 2 and then divided by two	sd	5
You still have 27	Yeah but all these numbers here it would be just 39 times three divided by two but for nine times three I said that it was 36 and I got 18 for that	sd	5
Mathland hows it going	Good	ba	1
Yeah you have 27 divided by four so that means	On question C 5 14 divided by three divided by one	sd	4
If she wants to put 38 cup of frosting on each cupcake it would be divided by 38	Okay thank you	sd	1
Okay thank you	I didnt see it	sd	1
Try this one next	Is that the answer	sd	1
It is	I dont think I got this one right	sd	4
Four would go into 27 six times because six times four is 24 with 34 left over	Oh	b	1
If somebodys	How would you draw a model for it	sd	3
How many times does four go into 27	Six times	sd	4
With what left over	With three	sd	4
34 left over	Oh	b	1
If it helps you to take this part and then to write it as a fraction you can definitely do that	Okay	b	1
Precious How are you doing	Im good	sd	1
Im good	How are you	qy	1
Hows your day off Yesterday	pretty good	ba	1
pretty good	I had some trouble getting on my computer this morning	sd	1
I had some trouble getting on my computer this morning	But other than that was pretty good	sd	1
How are you doing	Good	ba	1
Hows your day off yesterday	It was all right	sd	1
It was all right	I had plans but I never stuck to them	sd	1
It was your fault or someone elses fault	Um yeah I mean like I had made plans with someone else but they never texted me the entire day	sd	1
Thats the worst	Yeah	b	1
Andrea how are you doing	I am good sorry	sd	1
How are you doing Melissay	Good	ba	1
Good	How about you doing	qy	1
Just to make me feel a little bit better	Does it work	sd	1
There we go	Does it help	sd	1
Did anybody even laugh a little bit at that joke	I did	sd	1
Thats a confusing one today	You know actually my cousin	sd	1
You know actually my cousin	She plays Viola for her orchestra	sd	1
She plays Viola for her orchestra	And her Viola instructor is actually she says that all the time	sd	1
Okay so like I said I want you to just try try to fill out whatever you can	Since it doesnt show the y intercept can we just put the y intercept wherever we want	sd	4
Negative 2x plus zero	Yes	b	1
If Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
But I like the way youre thinking about it because thats exactly the problem with this one is we dont know what the y intercept is from the equation	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Alright then	aa	1
Miguel	We were finding we were doing multiplication with multiple numbers	sd	4
Multiplication with multi digit numbers	Multiplication  multiplication	sd	4
Aria what did we call it	Multiplication facts	aa	4
No	Extended multiplication facts	sd	4
Do you remember this	Yes	b	1
Nathan	then when you finished it  like a big number	sd	4
What would you do	You would just since you have 40 since its an even number	sd	5
You would just since you have 40 since its an even number	You would just add 20	sd	5
Miguel what do you think	You add four times two and then when youre done with that you add the zeros	sd	5
Do we know what four times two is	Eight	sd	4
Whatd you get	3500	b	4
Five times seven is		b	4
Do we remember this stuff	Yes	b	1
Whos ever watched wrestling been to a wrestling match any of that stuff	I watched it on YouTube	sd	1
In order to wrestle here we have to have just one person against one person	My brother goes to Northland High School	sd	1
Nicole	But he got in quarantine	sd	1
But he got in quarantine	My brother my brother goes to Northland also	sd	1
How much is the five worth		b	4
How much is the eight worth	Eight	sd	4
What players do I have here	The 30 is 30	sd	4
Are you sure	Yes	b	1
Yes	Youre going to do that math and then add up all the numbers together to get the answer	sd	4
Whats five times three		b	4
Five times two is what		b	4
10 and then I need to add	One zero	sd	4
What about eight times three		b	4
And eight times two	Is 16	aa	4
Five plus one plus two	Eight	sd	4
Piece of cake right	You see that 56	sd	1
Yeah	It shows seven times eight	sd	4
Do you have your pencil	Yes	b	1
Do you have your paper	Yes	b	1
The four represents 40		b	1
40 and the three represents	Three	sd	4
Now 27 is going to get broken into two teams	20 and seven	sd	1
My 40 is going to wrestle with who		b	4
40 times 20 and who else is my 40 going to wrestle with	Seven	sd	4
Three has to wrestle with who		b	4
And then	Three times seven	sd	4
How are we feeling	Good	ba	1
Whats four times two	Eight	sd	4
Eight and then how many zeros do we need		b	4
Four times seven is	28	b	4
Do you see why its important that we know those basic facts	Yes	b	1
And three times seven		b	4
Im going to add my eight plus my two because I know that gives me		b	4
10 plus six more is		b	4
Questions	No	b	1
Im going to hand out a paper and then were going to play a little game	Another game to play	sd	1
Now were going to play blue	Lets play multiplication wrestling	sd	1
Lets play multiplication wrestling	Here we go	sd	1
Here we go	Use the numbers to find two two digit numbers that will get the highest possible product when multiplied	sd	1
If you look at the top	two digit numbers	sd	1
In those four spots I want you to write the numbers one five three and nine	Three and nine	sd	4
We could say 15 times 39 or we could arrange those cards to make other numbers	Ive got an idea	sd	1
Okay James whats your idea	91 and 53	sd	4
Okay why do you say 91 and 53	Those are the highest possible numbers you can make	sd	4
Those are the highest possible numbers you can make	Youre putting in	sd	1
All right	Create two teams by showing each number as a sum of tens and ones	sd	1
one and over here for 50 and three we would it break that into	Five and three	sd	4
You following me	Complete the right multiplication sentence for  each of the four products	sd	1
Whats nine times five		b	4
Whats nine times three		b	4
Whats one times 50		b	4
One times what	Three	sd	4
times three whats one times three	Three	sd	4
Three	Enter the total	sd	1
4823	Yes	b	1
Does everybody agree	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	This total is your new high product	sd	1
This total is your new high product	Congratulations	aa	1
Congratulations	Use the numbers to form two two digit numbers that will give the highest possible product when multiplied	sd	1
Now were going to	your two two digit numbers	sd	1
How are we feeling	Good	ba	1
We okay to play this game for a little bit	Yeah	b	1
All right	Lets do it	sd	1
What is that number	904 and 8000	sd	4
Are you guys set	This is how I learned how to do it	sd	1
This is how I learned how to do it	I never learned that way	sd	2
So Mark is showing his math skills and hes going to do it with partial sums	I know what I did but not	sd	1
So will you explain what you did here	So I added I first added both the ones place and I got six then I added the tens place and I got one and one tenth	sd	5
So I added I first added both the ones place and I got six then I added the tens place and I got one and one tenth	Then I added the hundreds place and I got	sd	5
Four hundreds plus five hundreds equals	Nine hundreds	sd	4
Can you walk us through it	So I put the numbers vertically and I added four plus five is nine and eight plus three is eleven	sd	5
Natalie	She had to do it that way so she could carry that one to make another one	sd	5
Why did that one come over there	So the reason she had to put that there was because it was eight plus three which would equal 11 which was more than 10	sd	5
So the reason she had to put that there was because it was eight plus three which would equal 11 which was more than 10	So then she would put the 10 up there and then she would keep the one down there	sd	5
Landon why dont you agree with me	I dont agree because the decimal	sd	5
Come point to what youre talking about	Dont point to what youre talking about	sd	1
Dont point to what youre talking about	This number is in the correct place value but this one it needs to be moved over one spot because the decimals right here	sd	5
This number is in the correct place value but this one it needs to be moved over one spot because the decimals right here	And it has to be over here	sd	1
And it has to be over here	Because this is a whole in the ones place	sd	5
So when it says show your work I want to see your work	Are we allowed to work together	sd	1
Read that number for me Missy	04	b	1
Paul will you please read our Learning Target for today	I will use multiple subtraction algorithms including the countingup subtraction algorithms to subtract decimals	sd	1
I will use multiple subtraction algorithms including the countingup subtraction algorithms to subtract decimals	I will also use the alignment rule to make sure that I do not misalign the decimals	sd	1
Mariah	Counting up subtraction	sd	4
Anything else interesting	I see misalign	sd	4
Did you guys not talk about it	We did	sd	1
We did	We did	sd	1
We did	You were talking with us	sd	1
Tera	It means to have them straight or in a line like	sd	4
Straight in a line	Yes	b	1
Hudson	When you dont look like that	sd	4
What is wrong with that	Its misaligned	sd	5
Its misaligned	The ones place is with the tenths place	sd	5
The ones place is with the tenths place	You can put zeros to hold them	sd	2
How would you align it AJ	Ill scoot it up to the bottom	sd	4
Use mathematical words	Put the 15	sd	4
How can you line it up Sorry Angela	The decimal point	sd	4
Say it AJ	You line it up by decimal points	sd	1
Yes the decimal points need to be right in the line above or below each other	They always want to be best friends	sd	4
They always want to be best friends	They dont want to be	sd	4
Are we clear	Misalign	aa	1
Everybody say alignment	Alignment	sd	1
AJ	I will now I am successful when I have aligned and solved the subtraction problems on journal page 148 using at least one of each of the multiple subtraction algorithms	sd	1
Whats the last part	Yes	aa	1
For this one what was your estimate Amara	Excuse me	aa	1

Do we start with the biggest number or do we start with the smallest number	Smallest	sd	4
Can I take one away from zero	No	b	1
What do I need to do	Borrow	aa	4
Im going to borrow from	Eight	sd	4
Yes in the hundredths place and eight becomes a	Seven	sd	4
Zero becomes a		b	4
I cant take nine from seven so what do I need to do	Borrow	aa	4
Did you guys all see that	Yes	b	1
17  9 is	Eight	sd	4
Are you ready for this craziness	Yes	b	1
I need to add 0 What do I need to add to this to get that to be a 0	Seven	sd	4
Do guys all get that	Yes	b	1
Were not there yet are we	Can we just add one	sd	4
Can we just add one	You can add one and 48	sd	2
Do you guys see why I did 148	Yes	b	1
Once again I have to make sure that that is aligned right	Yes	b	1
Im going to add that up 9 8 7  4 is		b	4
Did I get the same number	Yes	b	1
Any questions	No	b	1
On the first one Mariah will you please read the instructions	Make an estimate	sd	1
Make an estimate	Write a number sentence to show how you estimated	sd	1
Write a number sentence to show how you estimated	Then solve using the trade first subtraction counting up subtraction or US traditional subtraction	sd	1
Then solve using the trade first subtraction counting up subtraction or US traditional subtraction	Show your work use your estimates to check that your answer makes sense	sd	1
What is the first thing youre going to do Clay	Make an estimate	sd	4
Easypeasy	It would be 47	sd	4
It would be 47	No it would be 46 right	sd	4
46 is close to	50	b	4
50	5  3	b	4
Your answer makes sense	Your estimate is close to	sd	4
Okay page 148 go	This is our last class	sd	1
This is our last class	Is it recording us	sd	1
Yeah	Hi	b	1
I think it might be right there in your bag	So this is technically third period right	sd	1
This is first period	What	ba	1
Were  just going to write that first one because thats really where were going to focus our energy today	Wait	sd	1
Wait	What is it	sd	1
I can choose and create diagrams to help me compare two situations	Thanks	b	1
Thanks	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	I have a question	sd	3
I have a question	Are these things for the thing that you talked about	sv	1
Are these things for the thing that you talked about	A long time ago	sd	1
A long time ago	Okay	b	1
Yeah	Is that just turning with you	sd	1
Clayton what do you think	Ratio tables	sd	4
I want you guys to pretend that magically in front of you a treadmill has appeared	Oh gosh	ba	1
So its going a little faster	Im not allowed to jump	sd	1
Dakota what is a treadmill	A treadmill is where you can	sd	1
A treadmill is where you can	Its something that you run on	sv	1
Why do people run on them	Exercise	sd	1
Some people walk on them	I spin on mine	sd	1
That seems dangerous	Some people fall off	sd	1
Some people fall off	I tend to do that	sd	1
Now there are people who love to geek out on their treadmill data and we are going to look at two of those people today	Like my dad with his bike data	sd	1
Like my dad with his bike data	Its not any of us right	sd	1
Please be ready to share	Is it two  things the same and two things different	sd	1
I just want to see one thing thats the same and one thing thats different but if you see two and you want to write it go for it	Oh nevermind	sd	1
Oh nevermind	I was just raising hand to share	sd	1
Dakota do you want to share something that is the same or something that is different	I have something thats the same	sd	4
I have something thats the same	Its their distance traveled	sd	4
What is their distance	Is that a point	sd	4
Esther do you want to share something that is the same or something that is different	Something thats different is the time	sd	4
Something thats different is the time	Jadas is 30 minutes and Dallass is 24	sd	4
Next person Darby	Theyre using the same level	sd	4
I would guess that its like the same speed exactly	How hard it is I guess	sd	4
Thatcher you are next	Something that is different is that	sd	1
Something that is different is that	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Something that is the same they both have the same incline	sd	4
So you know what that means Thatcher when they say incline	No	b	1
So in	I know	aa	1
Go for it Delta	So an incline is like a hill	sd	4
So an incline is like a hill	Its how much its harder to get I guess	sd	4
Denver what is something that you noticed that was the same or different	Both of them lost different Calories	sd	4
Yeah	One had  and one had	sd	1
So Denver who burned more calories	Dallas	sd	4
I missed it	Dallas	sd	4
Sure	Ive got two questions	sd	3
Ive got two questions	Whats the word above the	sd	3
We were trying to figure that out in my other class	Whats the word above	sd	3
Whats the word above	Does this stand for the heart rate	sd	2
Does this stand for the heart rate		b	2
	Isnt it normally just	sd	1
Theyre important numbers	Heart rate	sd	4
Do you know what those numbers mean	I dont know but its just a guess	sd	1
I dont know but its just a guess	Maybe pace	sd	4
Tell  me more	Like how fast theyre going	sd	4
Tell me more	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	I think its pace because I see	sd	4
It is their pace	I dont think thats normal	sv	1
Titan what would you like to add	So its like a ratio how many steps they take in a certain amount of time	sd	4
Youre on the right track	Its how far youve gone	sd	4
Its how far youve gone	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Its just like a	sd	1
Clayton	Is it measured in kilometers	sd	4
Its not feet	Meters	sd	4
Last one	Miles	aa	4
This ones in miles and what do you guys suppose the time is	How long they did it for	sd	4
What unit are they using to measure time	An hour	sd	4
What do you think Thatcher	Minutes	sd	4
Titan	Miles per hour	sd	4
Im just going to turn to a clean page so you guys can follow along and Im going to start with  Dallas and Im going to start with your great discussion of the two things we are comparing and the two things we are comparing are what crew	Distance and time	sd	4
So Gemma what needs to go in the first column of Dallass table	How many minutes it took her to go one mile	sd	4
Yeah and how many minutes did it take her to go one mile	Eight minutes	sd	4
What should we put there	30 minutes	sd	4
How many miles was she able to go in 30 minutes	Three	sd	4
Delta do you have a proposal	Id say youd scale both of them down so you get to the unit rate	sd	4
Tell me exactly what we should do on Jadas	Divide by three	sd	4
Divide by three	Its that same situation	sd	4
Okay	Sorry	b	1
Then Delta what are we going to have	Were going to have 10 and one	sd	4
How come	Because she only  24 minutes and if she was running faster she	sd	5
What on our ratio table will help us support that Dallas is the faster runner	I put  eight minutes to the 10	sd	4
Dallas is a faster runner because	Because she takes less time to run the same distance	sd	5
Giselle can you read your statement	No	b	1
No	Im not ready yet	sd	1
Tyson can you read yours	Dallas is the faster runner because she takes less time to run the same distance	sd	5
Go for it	I said that Dallas is the  faster runner because  took her less time to run the exact same distance as Jada	sd	5
Same rate	Page 15	sd	1
So if someone says same rate to you I want you to think about what that means	Its the same rate	sd	4
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Partner A on your marks get set	Someone else	sd	1
Partner B it is your turn	A unit rate is a rate	sd	4
Van what does same rate mean	Me and my partner thought it would be like the same unit rate of	sd	4
Delta	I thought it would be equivalent	sd	4
Turn over to page 15 please	Is this the last page of the packet	sd	1
Hes back and this time	missed you	aa	1
Diego paid 47 for three tickets to a concert	Damn	sd	1
Gwen what does that mean	It means did the tickets individually cost the same	sd	4
Westin what is some important information about Diego that we should pay attention to	How much he paid per ticket	sd	4
So how much did he pay		b	4
For how many tickets	Three	sd	4
So Diego paid 47 for three tickets and you guys know that I love to annotate	Im just saying that we could always do 47 times three and that also equals 141	sd	5
Hannah what is the important information we should pay attention to for Andre	141 for nine tickets	sd	4
Eden what are the two things that we are comparing for Diego	Price	sd	4
Mmhmm  and what else	Number of tickets	sd	4
Price  or money and tickets and what was the price Eden	For Diego its 47	sd	4
For how many tickets	Three	sd	4
Once again we are going to  compare money and tickets and Jolene what is our information we need to include there	Andre has the nine tickets and 141	sd	4
So what is your proposal to figure out if they have the same rate	When I came up with this I just thought of for Diegos you just multiple 47 and three times three and the tickets nine and the cost is 141	sd	5
Tell me why you picked three	Because three times three is nine and three times 47 is 141	sd	5
Then you did 47 times three and remind us what you got		b	4
Joyce what does this information mean	It means that  its equivalent to Andres amount of money	sd	4
Yeah	Its like theyre the same amount	sd	4
So how do we know its going to be the same amount per individual ticket	Because 47 times three is the answer for  47 times three is 141 and then  three times three equals nine which is the exact same thing thats equivalent to Andres rate	sd	5
Yeah Delta	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	So that was my question	sd	3
So that was my question	If you divided Andres ratio table divide by three we could get the same thing as the first column for Diego	sd	5
Would you like to check	Sure	b	1
12 divided by three is four so 120 divided by three would be 40 and then crew what is 21 divided by three	Seven	sd	4
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Yes	Put four	sd	1
As Im walking around I am not seeing ratio tables in everyones work today	I erased mine	sd	1
I wonder how long its been over there	Oh I see you	aa	1
Oh I see you	Wait	sd	1
Wait	What	ba	1
All right	Why was it looking at the wall	sd	1
For real my friends this is one of my favorite drinks	I didnt even know that was a thing	sd	1
I  love that some of you are going with your guts	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Am I wrong	sd	1
Thank you	I think Im wrong	sd	4
I think Im wrong	Yeah	b	2
Stand up please	I stood up	sd	1
I stood up	Im not standing but Im	sd	1
Frances what are the two things we are comparing	Orange juice and	sd	4
Orange juice and what else	Soda water	sd	4
How much orange juice and how much soda water	Three liters of orange juice and four liters of soda water	sd	4
Titan help me fill in the first column here	For Zyon	sd	1
For Zyon	There are four liters of OJ and five liters of soda	sd	4
Joyce lets hear it	I think we could find the unit rate of both of them	sd	4
Or do you want to do how much orange juice per soda water	Soda water per orange juice	sd	4
So you want to get to one orange  juice	Yeah	b	1
So in this first situation what should we divide by	If we want to get for orange juice we should go to one so divide by three	sd	5
Yes Delta	I have a question	sd	3
Oh sure	Does unit rate matter if the ones on the top or the bottom	sd	4
Does unit rate matter if the ones on the top or the bottom	Or does it not matter	sd	4
So just read it carefully but in this case we could have done it either way	Thank you	aa	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Thanks for your help which would be one and then crew what is five divided by four	Fourfifths	aa	4
Close	Fivefourths	sd	4
Fivefourths because its five divided by four which we can write as one and onefourth	You guys are all wrong	sd	2
Thatcher what did you just realize	I realized  that	sd	1
I realized  that	So that four over four is one and then plus five over four is one more and then you get onefourth minus the  and that one  equals one fourth	sd	5
So crew are these going to taste the same	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
So theyre not going to taste the same	Everybody was wrong	sd	2
Everybody was wrong	Everyone was	sd	2
Well everybody	Except him	sd	2
We know that	Zyon	b	4
Whats up	Well I think that Zyons would be more OJ because one and onethird has more of a chance to get to two because its only three thirds you have to get to instead of four	sd	5
What else you guys thinking	Wait	sd	1
Wait	I forgot	sd	1
Frances what do you think	One and onethird is bigger	sd	4
Because this is bigger its going to mean more water gets added and if more water gets added is it going to be more orangey or less orangey	Less orangey	sd	4
Are you guys ready	Yes	b	1
So if we count by fours and fives whats the first number theyll land on together	Onefourth	sd	4
Giselle		b	4
Hunter	When it says every other tenth and one it adds a zero every time to the decimal	sd	4
Noah	I chose two different ways of expanded form for the number three and four 82 thousandths	sd	4
What does expanded form mean Connor	If you were to do 1200 you would get 1000 200	sd	5
Quinn	If you have a shorter number you can make it longer	sd	4
Mason	I dont really know	sd	3
WilNoah	317 and 29 hundredths	sd	4
What place value is the number underlined in	I think thats turning when you move	sv	1
Okay were going to get our hands signals	Number one I think its in the tenths place	sv	4
Number two Mason	Maybe hundredths	sd	4
This is just a quick review because youre taking just a few seconds and then well flip it over	Do we write the place its in or the place of value	sd	1
The place on the place value chart its in	The value of it	sd	1
Number one Kate	is the hundredths place	sd	4
Number two Ariana	Thousandths	sd	4
34	Hundredths	sd	4
Natalie	34 thousandths hundredths	sd	4
Hundredths or 248 class	Thousandths	sd	4
Mason	Im pretty sure its 34	sd	4
Okay 34 what	34 hundredths	sd	4
How do you know	Because yes its a smaller number but its a bigger thing	sd	5
Because yes its a smaller number but its a bigger thing	Like 200	sd	5
Like 200	Id rather have 248	sd	5
Id rather have 248	Id rather have 34 of a hundred things than 248 of a thousand things	sd	5
Okay	Because theyre going to be bigger pieces	sd	5
Kate	I agree with Mason that its 34 hundredths	sd	2
Hudson	All ready	sd	1
So Id write that out as Did anyone write it as a greater than or less than	Yes	b	1
Does anyone know how many this has on it	No	b	1
Sophie	But those are rectangles	sd	4
Yep a thousand rectangles	Actually a hundred squares	sd	4
So it would have gotten two one two three four and then	Eight	sd	4
What place value Kate	Tenths	sd	4
How do you know the tenths place Natalie	Three is closer to a whole than two	sd	4
Addie	24 hundredths	sd	4
Two what Hunter	Tenths	sd	4
So now what Skyler four what	Squares	aa	4
I think were about ready to play top it	Top it	sd	1
Top it	I love top it	sd	1
I would call her in the whole thing and then Id have to draw another one	Two rows and five squares	sd	4
Tyler would you like to come color it in	Yes	b	1
Okay see if you agree with how Tyler colors it in	Two and then five squares	sd	4
Thanks Nate	I disagree	sd	2
Comments	I disagree with him	sd	2
That one was tough youll see	I respectfully disagree	aa	2
He didnt have to this could have been like this	Actually I got a little bit confused	sd	3
Actually I got a little bit confused	I thought the 18 was all in the tiny little square boxes	sd	1
Well honestly you could look at it as it is an eighth 18	Yeah I got confused	sd	3
Did we do the last one	Yes we did yellow	sd	1
You have five tenths eight hundredths and four	Can we do one more please	sd	1
You want to try	I do I want to try	sd	1
Brendan	I meant which ones greater	sd	3
Oh which ones greater	600	b	4
I think weve done it before	Yes we did it in class	sd	1
Camila Can you give me your answer to number one three collinear points	I said kcf	sd	4
and co planar means same plane	I said Ahce	sd	4
Can you pick a different one to replace it	K sorry	aa	4
Can you just replace a with a different one	Uh K	sd	4
Okay so say those points again	K wait hold on	sd	4
K wait hold on	KHCE	sd	4
Okay	would that be it	sd	4
Say it agian for m Amara	Would bch be it then	sd	4
Okay um Brad can you give me two lines please	Sorry B and H and F and k	sd	4
And what was your second one Brad	f and K	sd	4
If you put that one down if anyone put that one down okay and then um Lila how about one line that is not drawn	I said CE	sd	4
How about	inauidble HE	sd	4
Alright Lila just make sure you mute yourself please	Sorry	sd	1
And Lila Lila you have a question	Oh no sorry	aa	1
Whats the same about both of these	um the letters in the angle	sd	4
the letters in the angle and whats like exactly the same in the same exact spot in both of them	the end points in the middle	sd	4
All right any question on this little segment of notes so far	Why can you call it angle one	sd	3
The answer your question Lila	Yeah	b	1
Whats one way that you name this angle	Um did we go over that in like or cuz I was looking at the definitions and stuff in the pictures	sd	1
Um did we go over that in like or cuz I was looking at the definitions and stuff in the pictures	Is that what youre talking about like naming them	sd	1
Im talking about like how we named this angle like a x q or angle qx a	Oh okay so would this one just be S y z	sd	4
Yep	Okay	b	1
Whats another way that you could name this	Oh sorry	b	1
And then Angelina whats another way that you could name this angle	shp	sd	4
Okay any questions on any of these four Before I talk about one other one	Yeah Im wondering if you ever measure an angle more than 180 degrees	sd	4
starts with an R Anyone Remember that	Right Angle	b	4
Right Angle	reverse angle	sd	2
in green	5x plus 10 Plus Oh well I guess thats part of 180 degrees	sd	4
When you take the time to email me I take the time to	Not make you do it at recess	sd	1
I didnt do lunch count	Or the pledge	sd	1
Well do the announcements later	No	b	1
No	And the pledge	sd	1
If you are getting lunch today stand up	16	b	1
Okay so my lab today is part of our	Its wrong	sd	1
Its wrong	Oh no	ba	1
Yeah so this is the role of the constructed response that we were working on and I need you to	Get our white boards	sd	1
Yeah get your white boards out	Im so smart	sd	1
What does enlarge mean everybody	Big	sd	4
Ally is my only one missing correct	Yes	b	1
Thank you	I have a red one	sd	1
I have a red one	This came to mine	sd	1
Okay so throughout the lesson today your diagrams whatever youre making on those grids should be getting what	Larger	sd	4
Everyone close your eyes	I dont have a white board	sd	1
Close your eyes	Just put your mask over your eyes	sd	1
Okay so youre looking at this thinking about	Open your eyes	aa	1
What does the word greater than mean everybody	Its greater	sv	1
Its greater	Like more	sd	4
So you are going to go yes or no or is it true or both what you work with	Its T and F	sd	1
Its yes or no	Isnt it	sd	1
Minus 60	T	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
No	So you arent writing yes or no if its bigger than 45	sv	1
on my stuff	Its okay	sd	1
Lets go	No	b	1
Lets go	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Its not that hard	sd	1
Today we are going to conduct a fire drill	What	ba	1
I am just putting my sunglasses on	Ive been wearing my coat	sd	1
What	Are we still going to get our recess since we	sd	1
Greater than is the expression greater than 45 times nine	No	b	1
Do I need to know what 45 times nine is at all	No	b	1
If I am minusing 50 from the answer is it going to be greater than or less than	Less than	sd	4
If I am adding to it is it going to be greater than or less than	Greater than	sd	4
If I am multiplying it is it going to be greater than or less than	Greater than	sd	4
Do you understand why I asked if you needed to know exactly what 45 times nine was	Yeah	b	1
If I am subtracting 125 from it is my expression going to be less than or more than	Less than	sd	4
If Im subtracting 798 plus 212 from 798 plus 212 what is my answer going to be	Less	sd	4
If Im dividing it is it going to be more than or less than	Less than	sd	4
So all of these would be	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Yes	Theyre all yes	sd	2
Have a seat	Thats annoying	sd	1
Adam whats annoying	Matt	sd	1
Matt	Sorry	b	1
141 and 142	We have 10 more pages and were done because it stops at 151	sd	1
You are going to complete	141 and 42	sd	1
Go	All of it or just	sd	1
Wheres your Math Journal Skyler	I	b	1
So you stand when youre done	Do you want us to do both pages	sd	1
I cannot hear a word you say	it would be bigger because you double it so it would be bigger	sd	5
Whats it going to look like	It made it bigger	sd	4
You are right but all the way around	No	b	1
No	Its going to get bigger and narrower	sd	4
Okay	Im right here	aa	1
Check your work	Both pages	sd	1
Both pages	Yes	b	1
Go meet with Austin	Okay	b	1
Yeah after	Yes	b	1
Yes	It does	sd	1
It does	Thank you for being my partner	sd	1
Oh okay	Oh okay	b	1
Jason yeah can I bother you to prep your answer with Katie please	I got zero zero	sd	4
I got zero zero	Do we work it	sd	1
Youre welcome	Thank you	aa	1
Nick who did you check with	Maddy	sd	1
Oh Im going to wait for you to be done	All right	aa	1
All right	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	I got it	sd	1
What does a trapezoid have	Four sides	sd	4
Sarahs rule was double the first coordinate at that point so I am going to ask	To	sd	1
Matt to stand up please	Yes	b	1
Be specific	Can I just say what I wrote	sd	1
Yep tell us what you wrote buddy	I said If Sarah uses her rule I think she will get what she wants it because she wants it to be longer	sd	5
I said If Sarah uses her rule I think she will get what she wants it because she wants it to be longer	This is because if she doubles her first coordinate she will be doubling the X coordinate which is the length of the trapezoid	sd	5
This is because if she doubles her first coordinate she will be doubling the X coordinate which is the length of the trapezoid	This should be widerlonger	sd	5
Jonathan do you agree or disagree	I agree with him	sd	2
I agree with him	Because he says it would be doubled at X coordinate which	sd	5
So by doubling the X coordinate my trapezoid is getting	Wider	sd	4
If I double the Y coordinate my trapezoid is getting	Taller	aa	4
She is wanting to make it	Wider	sd	4
Please dont do that Kenneth	Okay	b	1
All right so drag the red quadrangle to what you think it will look like then press the next button	That was the next one	sd	1
So if I am doubling I start at zero because if I double zero I have what	Zero	sd	4
If I double five I have	10	b	4
If I double five I have	10	b	4
If I double zero I have	Zero	sd	4
Did I do what I needed to do	No	b	1
What did I not do Maddy	You just doubled	sd	4
You just doubled	You didnt put the other coordinates in	sd	4
You didnt put the other coordinates in	You just did the first one	sd	4
Oh so I need both of them in order to make this work	Yeah	b	1
If I double one I go to	To four	sd	2
To four	that one	sd	1
Oops two	No	b	1
No	I think it needs to be up top	sd	1
I think it needs to be up top	No because	sd	1
No because	And then	sd	1
And then	Oh you have to move the	sd	1
Oh you have to move the	Yeah	b	1
Oh I have to move that to four or to two right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	2
Than I have 10  so I can move that over	It has to be	sd	1
It has to be	It has to be by 10	sd	4
Is that better	Yes	b	1
Okay	I wasnt expecting it to that	sd	1
What is her first coordinate	Zero zero	sd	4
Okay so I have Maddy and I have Logan	Now you have me	sd	1
Now Michael what are the next coordinates going to be	Two and four	sd	4
Two and four	It didnt put the four	sd	1
All right Mr Michael this ones yours	Isnt that what we just finished	sd	1
Isnt that what we just finished	It is	aa	1
And then Haley whats the next one buddy	The next one is 10 four	sd	4
Nick whats the next one	10 zero	sd	4
Do we all agree with these	Yes	b	2
Yes	It even drew it for us	sd	1
Okay so we got that one	What	ba	1
What	Wait	sd	1
Why or why not	I said trapezoid  it wont	sd	1
I said trapezoid  it wont	The trapezoid wont measure  and then just got wider	sd	1
Add to what do you think we should add to it Anna	Why it works because the X coordinate made it wider and wouldnt make it if you wasnt doubling the Y coordinate	sd	5
All right so do you have a better understanding of what an explanation should look like	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
If you say a four I want you to use the information that I gave you when we discussed and I read what they wrote as a	Thank you	aa	1
Because you are what	The best of the best	sd	1
The best of the best	5th graders	sd	1
Did they have you do math	Yeah math writing	sd	1
Yeah math writing	I	b	1
I	Okay	b	1
Okay	I need you write my name	sd	1
Were you nervous	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Are you ready	qy	1
Do you guys mind if Michael joins you	Sure	b	1
Thank you	So we have a little thingy	sd	1
Okay	Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	sd	1
Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	He draws a picture	sd	1
Do you understand coordinate grids at all	of a book on the coordinate grid	sd	1
of a book on the coordinate grid	After drawing	sd	1
And if you do not its okay because sometimes I dont understand them	a picture of a larger book on the cover	sd	1
a picture of a larger book on the cover	How much larger	sd	1
How much larger	Thats what I was	sd	1
Okay	Right	b	1
So you see how I got my five one	Yeah	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Describe what you think will	sv	1
Okay so Im going to go to	I think we should say	sd	1
	I think we should say the book will double in size on the X coordinate and double in size on the Y coordinate	sd	4
Itll be up yeah	Make sure	b	1
So now we got a nine and we got a five	It will double	sd	4
So show me how you would take it from nine to the five	in size because we are	b	4
Mark it right	doubling	sd	4
High five	Now X	b	4
Now show me 11 seven	I totally just forgot my sentence	sd	1
I totally just forgot my sentence	And Y coordinates and Im going to put a common linking the bars	b	4
All right so we have Oh  so its got to be right there	Just so this will make	sd	1
Put it in there	Zero two zero 10	sd	4
It needs to come right there	a two two	sd	4
One more	and four eight zero	sd	4
Yep right there in that corner	and four eight	b	4
So now this one is	I feel were going to be doing it	sd	1
I feel were going to be doing it	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Youre going too fast	sd	1
Youre going too fast	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Im only on	sv	1
From your line	Hold on	sd	1

It should have been	Okay	sd	1
Okay	Do you want to go over them real quick	b	1
Do you want to go over them real quick	Yeah	sd	1
Now come like that before you	Four eight zero 10	sd	4
Take it all maybe down a little bit	four eight	b	4
four eight	Yep	sd	2
Ill show you what I do	four zero eight 10 eight 10 six 10	ba	4

Okay	Im on lesson 17 so I can wait for you	b	1
Im on lesson 17 so I can wait for you	Yeah	sd	1
Yeah	Lets go to lesson 17	b	1
How did you match up	So work on the before while I finish this page	sd	1
So work on the before while I finish this page	Both X and Y	sv	4
Both X and Y	So its going to double that	b	2
So its going to double that	Right	b	2
Right	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	aa	2
Yeah	That X right there	b	2
That X right there	Yeah	sd	2

What would that one be	Like 16	b	4
Like 16	Four eight	b	2
Okay	Okay nine zero	sd	4
My next one is up there	Oh I did mine	sd	1
Youve got to make sure you do the X coordinate first	Eight divided by Y	sd	4
You have to staple these	The next one two 10	sd	4
The next one two 10	Hold on	sd	1
Hold on	Im almost done	sd	1
I would like you to work on some math class because you are not doing homework until tomorrow night	What	sd	1
Okay	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	Put zero 10	sd	4
I should see SSs finishing and bringing me their rubric and their paper	Im finished	b	1
Im finished	Okay	sd	1
Okay	What did you get for the first one	sd	3
What did you get for the first one	I said 30 and three	b	4
I said 30 and three	15	sd	2
15	Add volume	sd	2
Add volume	seven plus 24	sd	2
seven plus 24	Oh seven times 24	ba	2
Oh seven times 24	That sounds big	sd	2
That sounds big	90 plus eight	b	2
90 plus eight	Oh yeah	b	2
Oh yeah	10 yeah	b	2
10 yeah	Okay	sd	1
Okay	Yeah and then I have like eight divided by two	sd	2
Yeah and then I have like eight divided by two	And then we have	sd	1
And then we have	Wait	sd	1
Wait	I took mine and said this how much you can fit into	b	2
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	sd	2
Yes	I do	sd	2
Sandy what did you say in the chat	I said ordering like on Amazon	sd	4
Pedro is that a little bit better	Kind of	sd	1
Like pin me to the screen	What	ba	1
What	you could pin her	sd	1
You can pin Me to the screen which makes me	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	b	1
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	Okay	b	1
Victoria	Sorry that was leftover	sd	1
If I say Put these four numbers in order from least to greatest	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Say the question again	sd	1
What does it mean if I say Put these numbers in order from least to greatest	To put the 12 first then 46 and then 120 and then 290	sd	4
So what did Victoria do	Victoria basically put all the numbers from least to greatest and put	sd	2
Victoria basically put all the numbers from least to greatest and put	the biggest number on the end	sd	2
the biggest number on the end		b	1
	And she did ordering	sd	2
And she did ordering	And she ordered the fraction	sd	2
And she ordered the fraction	As soon as Victoria talked about that I was like Wait	sd	1
As soon as Victoria talked about that I was like Wait	Oh I remember	sd	1
Tell me least to greatest	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	the number of least to greatest that its like a smaller number than the other	sd	1
So then what does the greatest mean	After I answer this can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Sure	I forgot	sd	1
I forgot	What was the question	sd	1
What was the question	What was it	sd	1
If least means smallest what does greatest mean	Greatest means biggest	sd	4
	Now can I	sd	1
Okay	Because least is smallest and greatest is biggest	sd	5
Pedro do you have something to add or you have a question	Kind of	sd	1
Kind of	But why does it say like ordering fractions when its like normal numbers	sd	3
So say I gave you these fractions and I say Put that in order from least to greatest	Oh I know	aa	1
How would you do this	so first the smallest one is oneeighth	sd	4
How do you know that Pedro	Because like if I draw a circle and then cut it into eight and only one its going to be really small	sd	5
Okay	And	sd	1
And	And then the second leastest is threeeighths	sd	4
And then the second leastest is threeeighths	Because like I said its like small	sd	5
Because like I said its like small	And then the five the fiveeighth is next and then	sd	4
And then the five the fiveeighth is next and then	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Wait wait wait a little wait	sd	1
Wait wait wait a little wait	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah	b	1
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah	And then the seveneighths	sd	4
Well thought in his head consciously or subconsciously that Hey these all have eight as the denominator which means that every single one of these is cut up into the same amount of pieces	Miss I already know something	sd	1
Miss I already know something		b	1
All right  what do you notice	You know how on top of oneeighth it shows oneeighth	sd	4
You know how on top of oneeighth it shows oneeighth	And like thirdeighth is like right beside it and like seveneighth is right above it and fiftheighth is like pretty close to it	sd	4
Ah	to the fiftheighth	sd	4
to the fiftheighth	And its like going in a pattern because one two	sd	5
And its like going in a pattern because one two	Its actually counting by I think Two three	sd	5
Its actually counting by I think Two three	I think its counting by twos	sv	5
I think its counting by twos	But I feel like its top numbers counting by twos here	sd	5
John what is the smallest fraction out of all three of these	Onetwelfth	sd	4
Onetwelfth	Because a higher number is smaller than a lower number	sd	5
Ooh what do you mean by that	Like you have a circle and then you have thirds in it	sd	4
Like you have a circle and then you have thirds in it	You fill in onethird which which is bigger than than onetwelfth	sd	4
Oh	And yeah same with the six onesixth	sd	4
can you add onto what John was saying	So John is also trying to say that the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	sd	5
	So he would have chosen threeeighth three No onethird that would be a lot bigger because the pieces are bigger because the smaller the denominator the bigger the pieces	sd	5
Geo which ones bigger	Onethird	aa	4
Onethird	Because you know how you say the numerators the smallest or something or like the smallest number	sd	5
The bigger the denominator	The smaller the	sd	4
The smaller the	So I feel like the onethird is the biggest because onesixth is pretty low because you know how you said on the other one its super low	sd	5
So I feel like the onethird is the biggest because onesixth is pretty low because you know how you said on the other one its super low	I feel like thats why	sd	5
Whats my last fraction	Onesixth	sd	4
I think its easier to make than the pizzas		b	1
NO		b	1
How would you order these from least to greatest	So first of all I would draw three circles	sd	4
So first of all I would draw three circles	And then you make seven pieces on that one	sd	4
Its kind of hard to do sevenths	And we you do 10 on the other one	sd	4
Ooh Donna can I do rectangles	Yeah sure	b	1
Ooh	Miss is this like going to be like some Whats it called	sd	3
Miss is this like going to be like some Whats it called	Like is there something on like  and math thats like similar to this where	sd	3
Do you see how Im kind of struggling to draw pictures		b	1
	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Miss are you good	sd	1
They are evenish	Okay	b	1
Okay	And it would take a long time to draw a hundred squares but like if we divided the little rectangle and we made a hundred it wouldve been really small because they cant be big pieces	sd	4
So while I dont have a hundred here can we visualize how small the pieces are	Kind of	sd	2
Kind of	I feel like its more than a hundred but its okay	sd	2
I feel like its more than a hundred but its okay	I think its more filled in than their squares	sd	2
So tell me what were going to do with this information now	And so now we would compare which ones the biggest	sd	4
And so now we would compare which ones the biggest	Now we shade three pieces on each one and see which is which one is the biggest	sd	4
Now we shade three pieces on each one and see which is which one is the biggest	And so now we can compare which ones the biggest	sd	4
So which one is the biggest Donna	Three out of seven	sd	4
So Diana if I have Or sorry not Diana Donna if I have three slots and Im ordering from least to greatest which one is my biggest going to go in one two or three	Three	sd	4
So then which one is my smallest	Three out of a hundred	sd	4
And what is my middle	Three out of 10	sd	4
All right  what do you think we should do to look at this one and figure out which is the smallest	I think that we shouldnt draw because its going to take a while to draw	sd	5
I think that we shouldnt draw because its going to take a while to draw	So maybe we should think about the rule the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	sd	4
So maybe we should think about the rule the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	So I think that it would be	sv	1
So I think that it would be	Least to greatest would be fivea hundredth fivetenths twoa hundredth and then twotenths	sd	5
Least to greatest would be fivea hundredth fivetenths twoa hundredth and then twotenths	Thats what I think is how theyre going to be greater or less than	sv	5
If I just have fivea hundredths and twoa hundredths could you tell me which one was smaller	No	b	1
No	No it didnt	sd	2
Do they share the same denominator	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Pedro what you thinking	Its because I kind of want to do all of that at once	sd	1
Tell me how you would do it	Well okay	b	1
Well okay	So the leastest is twohundredths	sd	4
So the leastest is twohundredths	Because if you draw a hundred I know youre not going to do that	sd	5
Because if you draw a hundred I know youre not going to do that	But just picture in your head you have a hundred and like	sd	5
But just picture in your head you have a hundred and like	Okay and to draw twos going be really small	sd	5
Okay and to draw twos going be really small	And then if you do the fivehundredths it has the same denominator but five is greater than two	sd	5
And then if you do the fivehundredths it has the same denominator but five is greater than two	So we know the next one is fivehundredths	sd	5
All right Pedro continue on because you are on a roll buddy	And then the next one is twotenths because the same thing with the twotenths and fivetenths	sd	5
And then the next one is twotenths because the same thing with the twotenths and fivetenths	Five is greater than two and then  And then fivetenths the last one so we know thats the greatest	sd	5
Im going to	Multiply	sd	4
So what am I multiplying 10 by to turn it into a hundred		b	4
And whatever I do to the lower one	You have to do it to the top	sd	4
You have to do it to the top		b	1
	You have to do to the top	sd	2
You have to do to the top	You have to do it on the bathroom	sd	1
So now what you do is you multiply five times 10 and that is		b	4
	Oh 50	b	2
Oh 50		b	2

What do you think Cooper	I think its like an uneven fraction with the denominator  and its like an uneven number with an even number as a denominator and you have to break it down to something that	sd	5
What do you mean when you say uneven	Like that thing when you did like last time when we had two even fractions with one and then ten	sd	1

Caleb what were you doing to help you figure that out	I used I knew that two get the whole numbers two was equal to two of them whole number of the denominator so I added four plus four which was eight	sd	5
Tell me more about that	Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them	sd	5
Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them	It was one whole which was nine out of the whole	sd	5
Tell me a little bit more about that	The denominator was the four thats the whole and since we have two wholes we have to have the wholes add to get Because at the top to have a whole it will need to be four out of four	sd	5

Solomon did you figure it out	Yes	b	1
How	First	sd	1
Lets see lets go back to what we did two days ago and lets pull up some of those circles and see if theyre equal because our number line says they are equal right	Yes	b	1

How Amalia	You could put sixtwelfths in the middle because it could just equals 12 and sixtwelfths is a half and then you can count down	sd	5
Did you guys hear what Amalia said	Yes	b	1
Take your ruler find one half at the very top of your paper put your pencil on it as straight as you can and look down at your twelfths	Its sixtwelfths	sd	4

What would be a reasonable estimate for a percentage of freethrows for Team 1 Paulina	Maybe like around 80	sd	4
Around 80 Why is that reasonable	Its closer to a hundred percent than	sd	4
What percentage	50	b	4
No sorry between 50 and 100	Oh 75	b	4
What about Team 2	60	b	4
Okay 60 how did you get that	a little more than half	sd	4
60 maybe its a little over 60 a little under 60 I dont really know but were just estimating if thats a reasonable estimate	One way to  60 then 50 to 60 is 10 so you dont get to 90 so maybe we dont	sd	5
50 60 70 80 90 Roge saying because theres only four blocks it has to be a little bit more than 10 then its probably 62 or 63 or 64 somewhere there right	It might be wrong but the first one might correct with 90	sd	4
Okay	Yes what do I notice	sd	1
Roge what else	50 people voted and in  a hundred	sd	4
Okay so how did you get that	I added 69 to 31 and I got 100 and then did 17 and 33 I got 50	sd	5
If 31 people for every 100 people vote yes then this equals 31 percent of percent so what do we when we dont have a 100 people	We have to really keep it the same	sd	4
Well were really keeping it the same its true but were going to just put different clothes on it anyways so we can look at it so Michelle how could we do that	Would you add another set of	sd	4
Why would we do that	Im not sure if you add another	sd	4
The sportswriter for East Middle School newspaper wanted to report the percentages of fans for each school use the ratio table to account for a total of a hundred spectators so we now have how many spectators at the game		b	4
Why is it going to 100 useful	Well can I explain what I did first	sd	1
Well first I want people to know why we go to a hundred and then I would love to	Its easiest to get a percent when you have a 100 as the denominator	sd	4
Yes its easier to get the percents when you have a 100 as the denominator as the per per 100 so we are trying to go there and did you do like the quickest jump	No I did not	sd	1
No I did not	First I got it in half so I get	sd	4
Okay perfect because Im trying to remind people that multiple jumps are good	Yes so that will be 200	sd	4
400 divided by two gets us to 200 our goal is 100 so this is a great step Im just doing what I can do mental math to get where I want to go okay so what did you do then	Then I divided 240 by two which I got 120	sd	5
Everything is getting divided by two and that way the ratio is the same so 240 divided by two is one 120	160 divided by 2 is 80	sd	4
Im going to let	We decided to calculate that percent	sd	4
Oh yes Whatd you figure out	For team Y its 886	sd	4
886  oh okay good good job yes thats awesome and I think	Well point sixeight if thats right	sd	4
Oh sorry thats 49	Yes 83	aa	4
So if Im going to go from 200 spectators down to 1 River what am I going to do	Divide 200 by 2 to get 100	sd	5
Nice	Then 240 divided by 2	sd	4
Rebecca	40	b	4
All right whats the percent of West fans		b	4
Whats the ratio of East to West fans	East to West	sd	4
East to west	For every 6	sd	4
How else could I write that	46	b	4
Is this simplest	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	2
No	23	b	4
Nice job	Thats what I said	sd	2
So if I say write a comparison statement for this ratio what were you about to say	For every two East fans there are three West fans	sd	4
For every two East fans there are three West fans	For every four East fans there are six West fans	sd	4
Hermione	To ratio of East fans to West fans is 23	sd	4
To start if this is the ratio like the base ratio how many people are they talking about		b	4
Clay if you want to get to percent you want per how many	Hundredths	sd	4
What do you know about the relationship between 20 and 100	Far apart	sd	4
They are far apart yes youre right	Or even numbers	sd	4
If there were 100	We say numbers	sd	4
What have you guys got	Im confused	sd	3
What is your responsibility	Ask around	sd	1
20x50 is 1000	Oh times five	sd	4
You said it hes just doing what youre doing	Okay	b	1
So what do we do with the top numbers	Five degrees	sd	4
The questions are on the back so if youve kind of figured out the table you need to flip over your page and answer the questions about your table	What table do you have	qy	3
How is that going to break	Add 180 and then you would add 180 to each one of those	sd	4
Right or 20 x 4	Equals 80	sd	4
Yes are you  the ones in the back like I just said	I tried	sd	1
Sitting back and hanging out and you dont know what  Whats your strategy	It doesnt work there	sd	4
These two	Yes	b	1
How are you guys doing	I have a question	sd	1
Then put the  All right	Were doing the multiple	sd	4
Yes	This one  Down here is your camera	sd	1
Uploading a file okay	Then you get a	sd	1
Right here	65	b	4
Im sure thats what you got but youve just got to look at your sheet	I got 75	sd	4
Did you do times five	Yes	b	1
You admitted though that that was both assignments took you 30 minutes	Fifteen minutes	sd	1
Fifteen minutes	No but there is more	sd	1
Yes	You still have my calculator	sd	1
Tell me what you did	So what I did is I put the parentheses near the four and five because that will equal nine	sd	5
So what I did is I put the parentheses near the four and five because that will equal nine	And I know that nine if you go down three times it will equal three	sd	5
Or nine divided by three	Yeah	b	1
Yeah so one and two thirds	Yeah	b	1
So what did you do	I first got  twenty	sd	5
I first got  twenty	So then were going to do four plus two which will be six	sd	5
So then were going to do four plus two which will be six	And then six times five is 30	sd	5
And then six times five is 30	Yeah	b	1
What did you do	I did minus two first because that would be negative two	sd	5
I did minus two first because that would be negative two	And then I did two plus four which sorry then I did plus three which is one and two times four	sd	5
And then I did two plus four which sorry then I did plus three which is one and two times four	Two times four is eight	sd	5
Two times four is eight	And then that would be nine	sd	5
And then that would be nine	Oh wait nevermind	sd	4
14 plus 16 is 30 right	Yeah	b	1
So the only other thing you could do is the middle right	So can I say what I think	sd	1
What do you think it is	So I think its easy to do two plus eight first and then turn on that so that 10 times 7 is 70 and 10 times 2	sd	5
Or 70 times two	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Would be 140	sd	4
Okay last one	Im stuck	sd	3
Howd you whatd you think	I thought you should you should do three question four and then you should times 55 then minus two by four then two then it was double	sv	5
I thought you should you should do three question four and then you should times 55 then minus two by four then two then it was double	So thats how you get there	sv	1
Like a quiz	Yeah	b	1
Cause when I give you guys a quiz what am I trying to do	Test us	sd	4
On so that why	So you can know what we learned	sd	4
So I can what	Know what we learned	sd	4
Alec will you read that for us	I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule	sd	1
You have the answer	I think Sam because you dont have the denominator	sd	5
So Aiden will you say that out loud again	Thats incorrect because you cant add the denominator together	sv	5
Lyla	I would show that if you see from in the fifths section three fifths is less than the number that you would even multiply or add together	sd	5
Three fifths is less than what	Two thirds	sd	4
Is there another tool you could show me with	if you add one half thats more than one third	sd	5
Thats more than a more than a whole	Im thinking you would have probably one sixth	sd	4
Aiden	Just to let you know that the battery on the swivel it says battery low	sd	1
Talk about just that information and how do you know	And how do I know	sd	1
And how do I know	She had the denominator and five plus one is  and twelve minus ten is negative numbers	sd	5
Anna	I dont think the answer makes sense	sd	4
Caleb	I agree with her	sd	2
I agree with her	I dont think it makes sense	sd	4
I dont think it makes sense	Because if your minus then five minus one is not going to stay five	sd	5
To you	No it doesnt make sense because you cant have if we have the  denominator the you cant	sd	5
You want to go point at something	If you have five slices and you were to take away one you wouldnt have five slices left you would have four slices left	sd	5
What do you know about five tenths and subtracting	I know its hard	sd	1
I dont know which one of these	Its the purple one	sd	4
Okay	There it is	sd	1
There it is	Its five out of 10	sd	5
What is that	Its five tenths	sd	4
What is that	Its half	sd	4
Aiden	Half	sd	4
It needs to be a half	One of them needs to be	sd	1
One of them needs to be	One of the numbers have to be half or a whole	sd	4
I need you to get your whiteboards out	Wait do I press	sd	1
I would like you to write this decimal in words on your slate	Write this decimal in words on your slate	sd	1
Write this decimal in words on your slate	The decimal or just the number	sd	1
Just do your your best spelling	I hope I spelt some of that right	sd	1
I hope I spelt some of that right	Like I know how to write in words its just the spelling is	sd	1
Like I know how to write in words its just the spelling is	I think we all have to spell it all correctly	sd	1
Please share with your shoulder partner what you wrote	Twelve and 84 hundredths	sd	4
Would you like a marker thats not red	I have a black one	sd	1
I have a black one	crosstalk	b	1
I will Give you like 10 more seconds if youre not done thats just gonna have to be	Crosstalk	b	1
Im going to give you one minute and 30 seconds	Crosstalk	b	1
It looks like you guys dont need as much time as I gave you	Its kinda a short number	sd	1
Its kinda a short number	inaudible only a minute	sd	1
So therell be more time for that	Crosstalk	b	1
What do you get	I got seven and five hundredths	sd	4
Alex I guess seven and 500ths	Yes	b	1
What do you think about Alexs answer	I agree inauidble	sd	2
Thank you for sharing your thoughts	Crosstalk	b	1
Three minutes	Crosstalk	b	1
timer is going to have two problems to do	Crosstalk	b	1
Guys I dont know why theyre talking while youre solving	Is this independant	sd	1
Is this independant	Mhmm	aa	1
Mhmm	Excuse me	sd	1
passing it back and forth Are we just going to put it throw it into a trash can	crosstalk	b	1
if youre finished Madeline	Can you show me what the direction say	sd	1
this row is partner A	which window	aa	1
A B A B A B A B Alright Lily Is that a question or a partner o a handraise	Partner A	sd	1
Okay	The door has a window	sd	1
and then Partner B is your job to respond	Crosstalk	b	1
And another pair wasnt quite discussing that but I do want to hear	You press this button	sd	1
And how are the problems different	inaudible Im gonna do Number two	sd	1
okay	But I got the number one	sd	1
But I got the number one	So I think its I think inaudible and I think inaudible Because inaudible so we dont have three and because the denominators on the question are five five And theres the same	sd	5
so they have a common denominator	And then since the four minus one again and the like and the numerator is the same thing inaudible	sd	4
Okay so you said the common denominator is teh same so you could do the format is 1 for 35th and four minus the whole number	Darn it	sd	1
inaudible Did you agree with Lionels answer	So I said we think thats because the inadudible were three inauidble and because the numerators are four minus one and three and because of the dominators are the same inaudible	sd	5
So Lionels answer was three and three fifths	I agree with Lionels answer	sd	2
I agree with Lionels answer	I got the same answer	sd	2
Wayne	Theyre similar and different	sd	4
Theyre similar and different	theyre similar Is their both like the denominators of the non whole numbers are odd	sd	4
Okay	Theyre similar	sd	4
Theyre similar	Is that each others answers that has one	sd	4
how we problem similar or different	Theyre similar because they both have inauidble They have the same denominators	sd	5
What do you call it when you have the same denominator	Common denominator	sd	4
Oh so Lily would you say Are you saying that thats something they have similar in both problems are already a common denominator	Yeah And then different is I dont know how to explain	sd	3
And I know you can explain it	So number you can subtract one from the four but number two you cant subtract two from inauidble	sd	4
Kaliah	I didnt actually do this in my book because I got an addition	sd	1
I didnt actually do this in my book because I got an addition	But you have to turn three into two and add it to go once or be four	sd	5
Argo	trade first then subtract	sd	4
it was inauidble a trade first but we were re Whoo	regrouping	aa	4
What was different is that in the first problem you can subtract without regrouping	Yes	aa	1
Does that fall in line with what you guys have to do	Yes	b	1
Hannah	Howd you get 43rds If the max is three thirds	sd	3
was there a max	Not a max	sd	4
Not a max	Its not technically a max	sd	2
Its not technically a max	But how did you get 43rds	sd	3
I added those three thirds to the 13 and got four thirds	I guess three plus one is four	sd	5
were all fine	Was it on	sd	1
Okay can you guys do me a favor and perhaps remember that were doing a math lesson that is recorded	Crosstalk	b	1
It would be helpful if we kept our talk related to math	crosstalk	b	1
Talk about how you would estimate inaudible	How to  estimate is to is to see the the denominator I saee the denominator then I look at the numerator and see if I can do it quickly in my head	sd	4
How to  estimate is to is to see the the denominator I saee the denominator then I look at the numerator and see if I can do it quickly in my head	And if I can inaudible that wthe quickest way or to estimate the quickest way	sd	4
And if I can inaudible that wthe quickest way or to estimate the quickest way	crosstalk	b	1
How do you estimate for number three William	So I rounded nine to 10 and eight to 10	sd	5
So I rounded nine to 10 and eight to 10	So I did 10 minus 10 equals zero	sd	5
So I did 10 minus 10 equals zero	if my estimate is correct my answer will be close to zero	sd	5
HOld on  you said this is close to a whole	Yes	b	1
And then you said this is close to a whole	Yes	b	1
What about estimate from number four  Alex	For number four I turned three thirds into a whole inaudible and the 13rd into a whole	sd	4
it doesnt have to be closer to zero or a whole it could be close to half	inauidble nevermind	sd	1
So a whole minus half is about what	A half	sd	4
Were going to end up with close	to a half	sd	4
Hold on	I did not want to be chosen	sd	1
And share with the class how you solved it	I guess	aa	1
okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	So the first thing I did is estimate	sd	4
Uh huh	And my estimate was close to zero	sd	4
Okay	Because nine minus 8 is 110th is one	sd	5
Because nine minus 8 is 110th is one	And the denominators and the numerators are the same so it would be inauidble	sd	5
Is that your estimate or your answer	Thats my estimate	sd	4
turn face us so that everyone like including Marlowe year can hear you	Okay so how I got my answer is nine minus 8 is one	sd	5
Okay so how I got my answer is nine minus 8 is one	9 minus eight isOne	sd	5
9 minus eight isOne	And the denominators are the same	sd	1
And the denominators are the same	So all you do is minusing 8	sd	1
minusing	subtracting	sd	4
Yeah so ask Hannah a question or respond to this answer	I agree with your answer very much	sd	2
Because	because nine minus eight is one	sd	5
because nine minus eight is one	Also is subtracting past tense	sd	1
Because just distracting me	Any more questions	sd	1
Any more questions	I agree with your answer	ba	2
I agree with your answer	I think you did a good job	sv	2
I think you did a good job	Thank you	aa	1
Franc come up here and solve number 4	I would be delighted	sd	4
So lets make sure we do a great job of	I will write this with honor	sd	1
So lets listen to Franc and his explanations	So you can either do four goes into three equals 12 or you could multiply them and do well	sd	5
to get your common denominator	And then so our common denominator is 12 and then inaudible	sd	1
SO hes not taking comments right now hes still explaining	three times 3 is nine	sd	5
three times 3 is nine	inauidble subtract inaudible	sd	5
Cory what do you think of that	I agree with you inauidble I like how you got your common denominator and you said you multiplied	sv	2
When you multiply 2 denominators what method is that for common denominator	Multiple	aa	4
Nope	QDC	b	4
What do you think about Clays answer	Hello CLay	sd	1
Hello CLay	Hi	b	1
Hi	So I i think  inauidble i politely Okay okay	sd	1
So I i think  inauidble i politely Okay okay	So is 412ths youre answer or is 512ths	sd	3
So is 412ths youre answer or is 512ths	My answer	sd	1
My answer	okay so your answers 5ths	qy	2
inaudible right now but his answers 512ths	Okay	b	1
Okay	So my I I slightly disagree	sd	2
So my I I slightly disagree	Okay	b	1
Okay	Because is that 912ths	sd	2
Because is that 912ths	Yeah this is 9 this is 4	aa	2
Yeah this is 9 this is 4	I write fours like that	sd	1
I write fours like that	How did you get the 9	sd	3
How did you get the 9	where did you get the 9 from	sd	3
where did you get the 9 from	three times three is 9  so on you do the same thing	sd	5
three times three is 9  so on you do the same thing	Because you will explain that to get that becomes 9 the denominator is 12 so I made a slight mistake on that	sd	5
Because you will explain that to get that becomes 9 the denominator is 12 so I made a slight mistake on that	I agree with your answer but I I did I did I did something wrong	sd	2
I agree with your answer but I I did I did I did something wrong	I forgot to do four times one and three times three	sd	4
So you understand it now	Okay	b	1
Okay	inauidble	sd	1
Thank you Duke you got 2 days in a row	Lucky	sd	1
Im going to give you 2 minutes to discuss your answer	for number five I got close to 3	sd	4
Do you guys need more time	Yes	b	1
DO your math boxes	If we both finished can we share	sd	1
You can always look to the page and work on your map boxes if youre done	I thought matg boxes ibauidble	sd	1
okay so lets look at the answers	Have you been doing it	sd	1
Have you been doing it	well Havent you you need to be sharing with a partner	sd	1
Argo	How howd they get one and five six and five and eight fifteenths	sd	3
How howd they get one and five six and five and eight fifteenths		b	2
Would you guys agree with that	Yeah	b	1
And two minus one is one	I knew I was missing something because I just realized that as soon as you put the as soon as you did the denominators I knew what I did wrong	sd	4
Did you guys see what you did	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I cant see	sd	1
Did you have a question Duke	No	b	1
Youre just not getting it	No Im not inauidble	sd	1
But you see what you did wrong	No	b	1
Can you explain for Duke	The answer is 1 and 56th Because if you did the QCD you were to get six as your common denominator	sd	5
The answer is 1 and 56th Because if you did the QCD you were to get six as your common denominator	And you do the usual you get three sixth and  two six but you cant do that because inauidble	sd	5
And you do the usual you get three sixth and  two six but you cant do that because inauidble	and then you have to  take the whole and then make it to eight and then subtract it	sd	5
So did you hear that Duke	Yes	b	1
Michelle what did you get for number two	I got seven and a half	sd	4
Hailey number three	I got 20	sd	4
Miranda	Half of 15 because 15 is an odd number	sd	5
Number one Alfred	Eight	sd	4
Sorry	First I did 13 of 8 and then I got 4 so then I just multiplied that by 2	sd	5
Anyone else did the same strategy	Yes	b	2
Atticus	We got 10 because we got the multiplication back when we did  First we did in thirds and then we get 510	sd	5
Arthur	23 of 60 I got 40	sd	4
Whats 13 of 60 friends	20	b	4
Okay Arthur	No	b	1
Classy classy	Yessy yessy	aa	1
Cyrus	We divided 12 by 5 and then we saw that there was the remainder and I know in one of the lessons we add the remainder like say it was remainder 2 and then its	sd	5
Now 5 times 4 is what	20	b	4
20	Its 20	sd	4
That would be Agree	Agree	sd	2
With your kneetoknee partner if you would like	What about the second one	sd	1
All the work like I do on mine	Ive been erasing all my work	sd	1
Dont erase your work	I forgot what	sd	1
Were showing Nadia active listening you know we expect from each other	What I did was I did 2 x 81 which equals 162 for the numerator and 5 x 1 5 and I figured out how many 5s goes into 162 which is 12 and I had a remainder of 2 so 162 is 12 and 25	sd	5
Okay Arthur would you like to add something	I dont want to add but my thinking is similar because I used the same with the way that she got the answer and I did get 1625 but then I didnt know how to convert it so I agree	sd	2
Youre stuck on the converting part	Yes	b	1
Cyrus	My thinking was different from it	sd	2
My thinking was different from it	I did the exact same thing she did and I got 1625 and then I did 32 x 5 because I want to get a close number to 162 and I got 160	sd	2
I did the exact same thing she did and I got 1625 and then I did 32 x 5 because I want to get a close number to 162 and I got 160	I have a remainder of 2 and I got an answer of 32 and 25	sd	5
Who can give us a whole step Arthur	You have to divide 162 by 5	sd	4
2 x 5 is	10	b	4
3 x 5 is	15	b	4
Plus one	16	b	4
Oh Im making it mad	Oh no	ba	1
Okay	Hopefully it doesnt hurt you	sd	1
What do we do with 160 Natasha	Subtract it	sd	4
162 minus 160 is what Atticus	Its two	sd	4
Calvin can you stand up and erase this while I switch screens	Yes	b	1
What do you think that means	Like fraction of but instead of whole numbers youre doing it on a fraction	sd	4
When you think of a fraction of problem what are we usually talking about	Its like multiplying	sd	4
When you see fractions of fractions what do you think we will be doing Rachel	I think multiplying a fraction by another fraction	sd	4
Okay apply who can read the word apply in yellow Nadia	To complete work using what you have learned already	sd	1
Extend Donald	To add on to your learning	sd	4
Just a little bit of think time by yourself	What do you do once youre done	sv	1
Did you draw a picture	No I dont like pictures	sd	1
Michelle	That we have different denominators	sd	4
Calvin how do we find the answer	What I did is I made it I guess since it was 34 and so I made it into 68	sd	4
Why did you make it into 68	Because I knew that 34 I couldnt divide that by a 12 because it was odd and odd number	sd	5
Okay so we had a half of 34 not 68	No I made it bigger into 68 and then I divided by a 12 or I made that into a half which was 38	sd	5
Natasha	since the two denominators are different I had to multiply what times what equals four so two times two and then I multiplied the numerators two times two and then I got 24 and 34 to the same denominator and then I got 54 so I converted it to 1 and 14	sd	5
You can just multiply across	Yes	b	1
Michelle	How many halves go into 34	sd	4
Cyrus	38	b	4
Classityclass	Yessityyes	aa	1
Okay when you have it folded in half just show me you do like this	Can we open it back up	sd	1
Jaden what did you notice	I have 24 now	sd	4
This is his brother so his brother gets how much of the fruit bar	14	b	4
So friends 12 x 1214	Yes sir	sd	1
1 x 1 is 1 2 x 2 is 4	2 x 2 is 4	sd	1
Maddison	We fold it in 12	sd	4
Fold it in 12	This is a little more confusing than the other one	sd	1
Let me do that again under there	Now theyre not even	sd	4
Classityclass	Yessityyes	aa	1
Who has it in stick right now	Me	b	1
Dexter what	26 or 13	sd	4
So thats why we still have our whole pizza here but she only had half she ate 23 of her 12 so overall she ate one 26 of the pizza which is 13	Okay	b	1
Jaden whats 1 x 2	Oh 2	b	4
Edwin whats 2 x 3	6	b	4
Does that match	Yes	b	1
173	So I give you these pictures	sd	1
Alfred	I need to put it into thirds and fourths	sd	4
Arthur	16	b	4
Nadia	My partner said that first she split into halves and then she colored one half inside and then she split it into thirds six and then she colored two thirds and then she got 26	sd	2
Hunter how much pizza was eaten by Eva	46	b	4
Madison	26	b	4
26 how do you know	Because you have two and six	sd	5
You take it and you split it into thirds so now you have I was coloring lightly 13 of that	Look what I did	sd	1
Yes	I thought that you mentioned	sd	1
How many of those 12 are shaded in	Gray	sd	1
What do you notice	Yessy yessy	aa	1
Wait how many of those fourths did I have	Four fourths	sd	4
Cyrus	You just shaded in 112	sd	4
112 why did you say a twelfth	Because theres 12 pieces in the entire whole	sd	5
Atticus are you doing B on your own	I did that one	sd	1
Jean	Three	sd	4
How do you know	Because theres three shaded in	sd	5
How many total squares are there Rachel	12	b	4
Jessie	312	b	4
Cyrus	14	b	4
Youre great	At first I thought this was two by and then I got	sd	4
You got the hang of it	I kind of got the hang of it I kind of	sd	1
Okay when you are done raise your hand so I can check your work	You got to erase this bottom piece	sd	4
You got to erase this bottom piece	Wait with just numbers right	sd	1
Wait with just numbers right	Im confused because 13 of 23	sd	4
You have 13 so you split it into thirds and you colored in your 13 right	Wait	sd	1
Then you have 13 and then you have 23 of that colored in	that makes a lot more sense	sd	1
The picture on number six is the toughest one	Are you supposed to check all of these or are you supposed to make these to that	sd	1
The first two are right now I want to check five and six and youre done	Im just stating my opinion and my opinion is in the state of the law whatever you say will be held against you in the court of law	sd	1
She needs some help it looks like	Yes I didnt	sd	1
Thats fine	The last ones super weirdHe most likely he doesnt care	sd	1
The last ones super weirdHe most likely he doesnt care	One two three four five	sd	1
They got an 80Is an 80 higher than this unit two grid	Yes	b	1
Is that higher than any of these prior overall units	No	b	1
Right Im seeing a little bit more struggles on this one which I expect because now we have the variable on both sides of the equation which always makes it a little bit harder to deal with	Im confused	sd	3
Want to see what you know	I dont know	sd	3
And theres no absolutely no risk with doing something wrong right now right	All right	aa	1
Do you ever play sport Ada	Um yeah I used to play football before we moved	sd	1
And so the point of practice is to like make some mistakes and figure out	Yeah	b	1
Shooting some baskets right now and seeing if we make them right	I play football not basketball	sd	1
Throwing some passes or kicking some field goals or whatever	All right	aa	1
Okay	Not really	sd	1
Then its something you and I are going to talk about during the help session okay	All right	aa	1
Youre going to get some practice problems that are just like that	Mr B	aa	1
Mr B	Isnt it 10	sd	4
No whats 30 divided by three		b	4
	I was about to say I was a little confused	sd	1
So our learning intention for foureight is I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points to form pictures	Yes	b	1
I love that you all went Yes	I	b	1
I	So I was talking to my mom about coordinates and how I love them so much and she said that they did this	sd	1
So I was talking to my mom about coordinates and how I love them so much and she said that they did this	I asked her to bring me home some because I love coordinates so much	sd	1
You really can	She made a star	sd	4
Make it smaller	Make it smaller	sd	1
Get out your	Whiteboards	sd	1
You know I have to tell you that I enjoyed our snow day yesterday	Same	sd	1
I dont know why	I had to shovel all of my friends driveways	sd	1
I wasnt here Monday and I was okay to justify that because you had the amazing Mrs Hunter	Woo woo	b	1
That is the weirdest thing	Excuse me Adam	sd	1
So a half one and a half	And a zero	sd	4
Or one one and a half two okay	Okay	b	1
Please stand up and cover your nose	Bless you	sd	1
Okay where did it go	Its buried	sd	1
Its buried and I because I didnt take it home with me didnt	Oh okay	b	1
Yes	Well maybe later	sd	1
Fingers up I mean	Wait so whats the half one again	sd	1
Half is just the five fingers	Okay	b	1
No one knows whats right or wrong yet so explain to me why you said a half	Mrs	aa	1
Hi	I want to see why they think its a half	sd	3
So why did you say that was a half	Because I thought it was closest	sd	5
Was that closer to a half or a whole	Bless you	sd	1
And then fivesixths is that closer to a half or a whole	A whole	sd	4
Is that what your answer was or was it just a half	A half	sd	4
Zach would you please	Suggesting why is a half	sd	1
Suggesting why is a half	I had zero	sd	4
How can we help his understanding change	Seveneighths is closer to one than it is half and fivesixths is closer to one than it is half then its pretty much one minus one	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yep	b	1
We have the greatest front office people	Yeah	b	1
Okay so I would like for Julia explain your reasoning behind this to me please	I think it would be because theres already a one and so threeeighths is close to a half and twothirds is also close to a half so a half plus a half would be a whole	sd	5
What do you think	Since they both have the same denominator if you subtract threefourths from onefourth that gets you two well	sd	5
Twofourths	Yeah and then the twofourths to the one you need to minus that	sd	5
Yeah and then the twofourths to the one you need to minus that	And then what I would do is I would take the two and turn it into eighths so I make it more easy and minus the twofourths probably eight which would get sixfourths	sd	5
Oh so you would turn it into eightfourths minus threefourths	Yeah	b	1
Why is it ninefourths	Because theres a one	sd	5
So whats ninefourths minus three fourths	Sixfourths	aa	4
Okay and you said originally what did you say your benchmark was	One and a half	sd	4
Nice job my loves	Good job	sd	1
Okay	T can I ask a quick question	sd	1
T can I ask a quick question	Are we going to share the Bill of Rights or should I put it away	sd	1
Oh you can put it away for right now	Okay	b	1
Put your finger	135	b	1
I want on 134 I want you to look at the coordinating points	That says graph and sailboats	sd	1
Coordinating points	Oh right here	b	1
You are in for a treat today	Woo hoo	sd	1
Because I can tell you that I have had two of those today	Oh wow	ba	1
Okay	Can I have some coffee	sd	1
So what I do when I do this is eightone fiveone and I use my straight edge	Rulers	sd	1
I love that John just turned his chair around	Thats hilarious	ba	1
Thats hilarious	Johns a brain	sd	1
Johns a brain	Yeah I think so	sd	1
Yeah I think so	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Zero one	sd	4
Zero one	T	b	1
T	It says fiveone twice	sd	1
If you dont do what its telling you to do Matt its not going to come out	The rulers dont fit	sd	1
Oh I see what I did wrong	I did it wrong but I did it	sd	4
Onetwo  All right	Woo its actually cool	sd	1
Woo its actually cool	Do you want us to do the new sailboat	sd	1
No	Okay	b	1
Youre supposed to stand when you are done	Okay	b	1
Okay	Its 16	sd	1
Its 16	Its 162	sd	1
If you have a microphone on your desk would you please bring it with you	Yes	b	1
Yes	We dont have microphones	sd	1
We dont have microphones	No thats not my mouse	sd	1
No thats not my mouse	Microsoft mouse	sd	1
Okay stand in front of someone thats in the circle	Should I stand in the circle T	sd	1
Then you do fiveseven not	So right there	aa	1
Yeah	T I got up while you were talking to her	sd	1
T I got up while you were talking to her	Should I go in front of someone or stay here	sd	1
Go in front of someone	Okay	b	1
Zach just join a SS	You can join with us Zach	sd	1
Go	Lets see	sd	1
Lets see	My sailboat looks the exact same as your sailboat	sd	2
Yeah then you would connect it to giveone	Yeah my sailboat looks like her sailboat	sd	2
Yeah my sailboat looks like her sailboat	It looks like you didnt connect it	sd	2
Like that okay	Great job Madeline	sd	2
Great job Madeline	Yes I think we have it done	sd	1
Okay once you and your partner have shared go to a zero	Including my partner	sd	1
Everyone else go back to your seats	Including my partner	sd	1
Does yours look like mine	Wait how did you go  Quarter okay so heres what	sd	1
So eight times two is	16	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Seven times two is	14	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Please continue that down	What would be zero	sd	3
What would be zero	Zero times two is zero	sd	5
Zero times two is zero	Yeah because anything times zero is zero	sd	5
I did five times two is 10	No	b	1
I said please continue to do that one	Nobody ever asked me about it	sd	1
Fill in the blanks	Times two	sd	1
Times two	And then	sd	1
Preferably a colored pencil or	Can you use pens	sv	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay when you are done doing that put your hands on your head	I have my hand on my head	sd	1
What	Its only times two	sd	4
Thats what I said	You can just add	sd	4
You can just add	Yeah you can just add	sd	2
You are writing the answer over it in colored pencil	Got it	sd	1
All right everybody zero times two	Zero	sd	4
Zero times two	Zero	sd	4
Seven times two	14	b	4
Zero times two	Zero	sd	4
Eight times two	16	b	4
You are going to graph them on the new sailboat	With our pencil or	sd	1
So now youre going to do the same thing	And do we list 16 too or just the ones we wrote	sd	1
And do we list 16 too or just the ones we wrote	Or we list all of them	sd	1
Or we list all of them	You list all of them	sd	1
You needed to list all of these	Okay okay	b	1
Okay okay	Yeah	b	1
Why are you using a check mark	To see which ones Ive done	sd	4
Bless you	Thank you	aa	1
What have we got going there	Its not straight	sd	4
Its not straight	Its just I did it straight at first now its that way	sd	4
So I would like you to connect because this has to be connected here in order for this to be correct right	Right	b	1
Its got to look like the one you did before so that tells you you missed something if it does not look like it did before	Oh	b	1
Oh	Oh shoot	sd	1
Okay those of you that are done what are you going to do with sailboat number two	Youre going to double the first coordinate and then leave the second one the same	sd	4
Sorry	Can we check it with a partner	sd	1
What are you confused with	The zerothree	sd	3
Wheres the two now	Its right here	sd	4
Theres your two so it would be right here	Right here	b	1
Right here	Okay	b	1
Okay so the first thing we need to do is erase everything	Gotcha	sd	1
Okay	If I cant even do this I cant do	sd	1
What is the first number	16two	sd	4
Okay	Wait are we timesing it by two again	sd	4
Now wheres 10two	Alyssa so were times	sd	4
Now youre going to connect those two	X but Y needs the same	sd	4
X but Y needs the same	Yeah were taking one away	sd	2
You already doubled it here so if youve got to make sure that you doubled	Oh its just half of the second number	sd	4
Oh its just half of the second number	Its just half of the second number because I looked at the first	sd	4
They should be the exact same as these	And then its half of the second number	sd	4
So this would be 10one 10seven twotwo 10one	Oh I was doing it as like 16two whats half of two	sd	5
Oh I was doing it as like 16two whats half of two	Thats one and then	sd	5
What are you struggling with my friend	I just dont get this	sd	3
Eight times two is	16	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Seven times two is	14	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Zero times zero	Zero	sd	4
Zero times two	Zero	sd	4
Seven times two	14	b	4
Zero times zero	Zero	sd	4
Eight times two	16	b	4
Then your next one	I made a sailboat too	sd	1
So now you need to draw a line this over to there okay	Im confused because	sd	3
I go horizontal first	Oh its 16	sd	4
And then I go vertical second	I didnt see that at the bottom here	sd	1
So horizontal vertical okay	Okay	b	1
Now connect that one	And then you have to do the second and then you can do that	sd	1
So eight times two is	16	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
Five times two is	10	b	4
So write two and what do we do with this	Write two	sd	4
Five times one is or five times two is	10	b	4
Zero times two is	Zero	sd	4
Seven times two is	14	b	4
Eight times two is	16	b	4
Eight times two is	16	b	4
That help	Yeah	b	1
All right how we doing	Im done	sd	1
Did you compare them	Yes	b	1
When you are done compare it	Seven	sd	4
If I give you the numbers you should be able to do this	Where did I get the seven	sd	3
So lets try and dont get frustrated	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	10seven right there	aa	4
Okay so remember when we coordinate this is  May I borrow your pencil	Theres no 1010 anywhere	sd	4
My X is after Ive done that so where would fiveseven be do you think	One second	sd	1
Now show me where onetwo is	Eighttwo and then fivetwo	sd	4
Whats your next one	Zerotwo	sd	4
Put an X there	What do you mean Adam	qy	2
When youve got it check your numbers with your friends	Im confused	sd	3
Im confused	T	b	1
Okay so those need to connect	Wow thats a very tall sail	sd	1
How much bigger	Double	sd	4
Okay so we made a little bit of an error here okay	She said when you and your partner are done raise your hand and shes going to come by	sd	1
16two is right there right	Yeah	b	1
Okay you guys are all done right	Yes	b	1
Are you ready	Yeah	b	1
You are going to triple the first number of the ordered pairs	Make sure your coordinates are right	sd	2
Make sure your coordinates are right	They might be wrong	sd	2
So I would circle that	And then leave the second one	sd	4
Thats what your new sailboat four will be	Okay	b	1
So you are doing the triple answering these questions and then down here youre going to triple the first number which would be eight times	Three	sd	4
Oh what did we do	I dont know because	sd	3
You just didnt	Oh	b	1
Well theres where your problem is because its not long enough	I dont like that sailboat	sd	1
I dont like that sailboat	Its weird	sd	1
Thats why you need to use the tools	Its tiny	sd	1
You guys did yours together right	We discussed it too	sd	1
Have you checked all your work together	No just us two	sd	1
I would check your work together	Want to work together	sd	1
Check your work together	We did	sd	1
Check your work and you guys are all checked	Just us two	sd	1
Make sure its the same	T	b	1
Okay now you guys are going to double the first number of the ordered pair	Together	sd	1
Turn the page and youre doing that one	Triple the second number	sd	4
No double	Oh double the first number	sd	5
Oh double the first number	Then you halve the second number	sd	5
Then you halve the second number	Do you want us to work together	sd	1
Okay	So you triple the first one and then you split the second one in half	sd	5
Elliot you have got to stop ripping your paper	I didnt mean to do that	sd	1
Why are we worried about numbers Adam when we should be working on math	T	b	1
What does this tell you to do	Double the first number	sd	4
And of the original pair what does it tell you to do with the second number	Leave it alone	sd	1
Im doubling the first number and then leaving the second one the same	Wait what about seven though	sd	3
Wait what about seven though	Thats	ba	1
Thats	I know	aa	1
I know	I dont know how to do seven	sd	3
I dont know how to do seven	I thought of zero	sd	4
I thought of zero	I dont know how to halve even	sd	3
I dont know how to halve even	You just split it into half and have like four and a half or something	sd	5
Why cant you do four and a half	Because where does the half go	sd	3
It would be between the squares	Wait so this would be halves not zero	sd	4
Wait so this would be halves not zero	This would be a half not zero	sd	4
Triple the first number of the ordered pair	This says double	sd	1
This says double	Were doubling this number	sd	4
So what is double the first number	16	b	4
And what is half of one	A half	sd	4
So if its 16 and a half	It would go right there	sd	4
It would be right there	Thats so weird	sd	1
I know	So half is in between the thing	sd	4
This is zero one two three one	Oh see  Oh	sd	1
One two	Okay I see where you put that	sd	1
Three	Oh thats weird	ba	1
If my coordinate is three and two and a half thats where it would be	Okay that	ba	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
So in between zero and one theres a half	And then	sd	1
In between one and two theres a half	Double zero would be a half right	sd	4
Double zero would be a half right	Or would that be a whole	sd	4
Or would that be a whole	Wait so first	sd	1
If I double zero	Oh thats just still going to be zero	sd	4
Zero and I attach a zero	Its going to be zero	sd	4
All right	But T	sd	1
Yes	So this one right here would be 10 and three one halves	sd	5
So this one right here would be 10 and three one halves	Because you double five thats 10 and then three one halves so its half	sd	5
Make sense	Yeah I dont like that	sd	1
But your brain is so smart it knows how to do it	It just doesnt like it	sd	1
Eight times	This is so weird	sd	1
This is so weird	16 and a half	sd	4
16 and a half	Wait so  Never mind	sd	1
Whats two plus two	Two plus two is four but	sd	4
If I need one more to get to five and I need to cut that in half whats half of one	Wait what would be half of zero	sd	3
Wait what would be half of zero	Negative one half	sd	4
Two and a half	Yeah but technically half of zero would go into the negatives so it would be negative one half	sd	5
Yeah but technically half of zero would go into the negatives so it would be negative one half	Do you do two smaller than five so that we stay the same	sd	5
No youre just cutting five in half	Six one halves	sd	4
Or it goes in two times because thats four	But	sd	1
But	How would you do two on this side	sd	3
Why would you do three	But thats my question	sd	1
I know that two plus two is four and that half of four is two	How wimpy is this sail	sd	1
And were going to do	Zero one half what	sd	3
Okay so one	Then fourzero	sd	4
Then fourzero	This is confusing	sd	3
A half two and then extend this out	16 is a half if Im right	sd	4
So now I have to label them onefour	What the heck is this boat	sd	1
So if I run that all the way out to five okay	Are you done	qy	1
Five four so three four	But Matt but Matt T assigned each person to something different	sd	1
Four a four a half	Uhhuh  she assigned some people something else so Id ask her which one she wants you to do	sd	1
One two and	A half	sd	4
So half of seven whats closest to  Three plus three is	Three plus three is six	sd	5
So if I did not	You made the go all the way to one and a half	sd	4
Whats closest to nine thats a whole number	I made it go to twoone then twoone	sd	4
So whats a half less than five	Okay there you go	sd	1
Whats between four and five	You need to make the line right here	sd	4
What do I get	11	b	4
Are you done	Yeah	b	1
Circle that and thats what youre doing to answer all those	Tell me more about our homework	sd	3
You need to be working	Ill move that space	sd	1
Elliot lets get going	Im not sure	sd	1
I would like you to do the triple okay	Can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Go show those friends yours and then come back and start on your math boxes or your homework	What friends	sd	1
Those friends	There Im done	sd	1
Howd we do buddy	Good	ba	1
I can tell you you needed to connect here to here	Oh thats okay	ba	1
So what does that mean Im multiplying everything by	Three	sd	4
So what would this first one be	24	b	4
When youve got those done call me over	Okay	b	1
Okay	So we do math boxes and our homework by ourselves right	sd	1
Go look at theirs so you can see the difference in them	We checked with them	sd	1
Home link for 48	By yourself right	aa	1
It has numbers and what	Points that show where the numbers are	sd	4
Isaiah said it has lines and Isaiah is actually correct because a line plot starts with	A line	sd	4
Jonah how do we know	Because its a straight line	sd	5
Im glad my middle schoolers know that means you paid attention to fourth grade	You know its a line because the arrows on the end show that it goes on forever	sd	5
Angel whats data	Data is something you collect and you are able to see what is	sd	4
This is a really hard question	What	ba	1
What	What	ba	1
How many pets do you have	I have	sd	1
How many	I have six	sd	1
How many	Im trying to think its a lot	sd	1
Thats more reasonable	Three	sd	1
What information do I now know Josie	How many pets each one of them have	sd	4
So if I walk next door and I gave those numbers like that to Mrs McCain would she understand what it means	No	b	1
Shell file for a divorce then Id be sad and I cry	Really	aa	1
You do that by putting a	A line	sd	4
A line	A line segment	sd	2
So if I made this title would that be a good title for my line plot	No	b	1
No	That	aa	1
What do you think we could write as a good title that if I took this information to Mrs McCain shed understand what it means	Pets	sd	4
How about pets per student	Yes	b	1
It does zero counts because is it possible to not have any pets	Yes	b	1
What axis are we working on	The Xaxis	sd	4
Right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
The way were going to illustrate our numbers in a line plot is with	Numbers	aa	4
Numbers	Xs	b	2
A smiley face is equal to three pets	What	ba	1
Mr Silas how manySSat Table 1 had zero pets	None	aa	4
Faith how manySShave one pet	One	aa	4
Do we know which one it stands for	No	b	1
Yes we do but will Mrs McCain if I bring her this data	No	b	1
Does it matter	No	b	1
How many have three	Amy	sd	4
If I took this line plot over the way it is right here I drew this on a piece of paper and I took it to Mrs McCain would she understand it	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
She knows that it is a line plot about pets perSat Table 1	But she doesnt need to know	sd	4
But she doesnt need to know	But it doesnt matter to her	sd	2
But it doesnt matter to her	But it doesnt matter	sd	2
But it doesnt matter	But it doesnt matter	sd	2
First off does she know how many people are at Table 1	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Using that data does she know how many people are at Table 1	Yes because	sd	1
If I would have done the whole class how many Xs would I have	24	b	4
24	Actually 22	sd	4
Actually 22	Twentytwo	sd	2
Theres really no way to make this go away huh	Thats cool with lights off	ba	1
Eliza	Because they  in them and you might get confused if you want to use one or more	sd	5
How many seven and 34 are there	Three	sd	4
Now when I taught the five of you in the back of the room the other day one of the things that I stressed was you take your data and you arrange it from	Smallest to biggest or biggest to smallest	sd	4
Smallest to greatest almost always	Jonah	b	1
I have tonights homework	Yay	sd	1
which because its Friday you dont have homework	Yay	sd	1
So were going to do it as classwork	Yay	sd	1
If youre struggling you may talk to your teammates for help or ask myself for help but I would like you all to try to start to do this on your own	Mr Parker you gave us a blank sheet	sd	1
Mr Parker you gave us a blank sheet	You gave us another blank sheet	sd	1
Okay	Ill keep it	sd	1
Its not blank	No	b	1
Oh that would help	Thank you	aa	1

And then it goes to two	One and one half and then three	sd	4
One and one half and then three	Can you tell or do you say how important	qy	3
Can you tell or do you say how important	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Is this a one	sd	1
Make sure everybody understands why  the line plot is going to be	I think its the smallest number to	sd	4
I think its the smallest number to	One half	sd	4
You want to start your line plot	So whats the last	sd	1
at one right	Yes	b	1
What happened to our piece of data that says one half	after the one half	sd	4
three is three more than three and a half	How about that	sd	1
How about that	Are you serious	qy	1
You dont have to keep erasing everything	Okay	b	1
Okay	So how many is one half	sd	3
So how many is one half	I found three and one half	sd	4
I found three and one half	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	How much do we	sd	3
Thats what you should be discussing as a team	Yes	b	1
Yes	One half plus one half	sd	4
One half plus one half	I have four ones	sd	4
I have four ones	One and a half plus one half which is	sd	4
One and a half plus one half which is	And then this whole one I need the other one	sd	4
And then this whole one I need the other one	Now one and one half	sd	4
Now one and one half	Theres seven	sd	4

I found four	Wheres the other one half at	sd	3
Wheres the other one half at	Many got zero	sd	4
Many got zero	One and one half	sd	4
Jonah do you have a clue or youre just still drawing and coloring	No	b	1
No	One half	sd	4
Is he right first off	Yes	b	2
Yes	No	b	2
Well what should it be	Half	sd	4
Correct	Yes	b	1
how did you know that a half is right	Because its the smallest	sd	4
Smallest what	Smallest fraction	sd	4
Does it matter with the side of this	No	b	1
Melissa	Just the height of the student	sd	4
What does it represent	The growth of the	sd	4
Good the amount that that particularShas grown over the past	Year	b	4
How much didSone grow in the first year Mackenzie	One and a half	sd	4
How much did they grow Leo	They grew	sd	1
Is that the smallest number in our data set	Yes	b	1
Silas looking at that data what is the largest any oneShas grown over the past year	One and one half	sd	4
What is the single most anySin that class has grown this past year Landon	Not one half	sd	4
Of all those numbers in your table This is not a trick question	Three and one half	sd	4
Three and what	Three and one half	sd	4
Is that our largest growth	Yes	b	1
Count them	Im almost	sd	1
Im almost	Is there nine of these	sd	4
I said count them	Theres three	sd	4
How many	Three	sd	4
Three	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
No	Its six	sd	4
How many spaces are there on your line plot for you to fill in	Seven	sd	4
Six unique numbers	Oh didnt know the	sd	1
Oh didnt know the	They were returned	sd	4
What number would that be	Three	sd	4
Your lowest should be one half your highest should be three and a half that means you have to fill three in but are there going to be any Xs	No	b	1
Almost	Inches that	sd	4
Its measured in	One half	sd	4
Half inches	Oh yes	b	1
If you understand something and somebody at your table doesnt talk to them about it Carlos	What is the greatest	sd	3
What is the greatest	As a half	sd	4
As a half	This is how much theyve grown	sd	4
This is how much theyve grown	Its one	sd	4
Its one	Ill go ask	sd	1
Yes	Isnt the	sd	1
Isnt the	I have no  or is it one and one half because that one	sd	4
I have no  or is it one and one half because that one	So then how many times is half	sd	3
So then how many times is half	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	Yes	b	1
Yes	I think  greater than one half	sd	4
I think  greater than one half	No but it says	sd	2
No but it says	Okay guys	b	1
Okay guys	I can deal with this	sd	1
I can deal with this	How am I supposed to	sd	1
How am I supposed to	I need help	sd	3
I need help	What do you need help with	sd	3
What do you need help with	Try the largest number	sd	2
Try the largest number	Wait	sd	1
Wait	What does it say	sd	3
What does it say	that the only answer you get	sd	4
that the only answer you get	Whats the smallest mixed number here or fraction	sd	3
Whats the smallest mixed number here or fraction	Lets start this	sv	1
Lets start this	That will be the first  so that one half	sd	4
Every time	Now how many one half	sd	3
Now how many one half	What would we do next	sd	3
So this student	So it would be three	sd	4
So it would be three	Okay	b	1
Okay	Whats the second smallest	sd	2
Whats the second smallest	What is the number you put before	sd	2
What is the number you put before	Okay	b	1
Okay	Its the second smallest number	sd	4
Its the second smallest number	Look at this number and just add one more just add one half of that	sd	5
Look at this number and just add one more just add one half of that	Okay	b	1
Okay	Add one half	sd	4
Add one half	Yes	b	2
Yes	Ive done	sd	1
Ive done	I finished there	sd	1
Theres interpreting a line plot where theyve already drawn the line plot for you and you just write the answers based on the line plot and then theres the backside where you create line plot	Now were on this one	sd	1
Guys when you get to the second one on the backside these bees arent bees theyre supposed to separate	Three	sd	1
Three	Theyre barely marked	sd	1
Go ahead and try that one	Its this work the one	sd	1
Its this work the one	The one	sd	1
The one	Three four five six seven	sd	1
Three four five six seven	Oh my God	ba	1
Oh my God	You look like anything before you get to sleep	sd	1
You look like anything before you get to sleep	I have to put the labels there	sd	4
All right	I have one half and with	sd	4
I have one half and with	What	ba	1
What	I want to	sd	1
I want to	Add one half to two	sd	4
Add one half to two	I just want to find the	sd	1
I just want to find the	Add one half to two and	sd	4
Add one half to two and	So I just want to do this	sd	1
So I just want to do this	Is that how you would  that	sv	4
Is that how you would  that	No	b	2
No	You use a zero	sd	2
You use a zero	Yes	b	2
Yes	I know what Im talking about	sd	1
I know what Im talking about	I like	sd	1
I like	Okay	b	1
Okay	I know better than	sd	1
I know better than	Thats 40	ba	4
Thats 40	What	ba	1
What	if you look at	qy	1
if you look at	Thats 15 times  which is 75	sd	4
Thats 15 times  which is 75	if were talking about youre supposed to be talking about	sd	1
if were talking about youre supposed to be talking about	Thats a lot of them	sd	4
Thats a lot of them	one half and then one half	sd	5
one half and then one half	And then one half minus	sd	5
When I redo this Im going to do exactly	Youre done	sd	2
Youre done	Biggest number minus	sd	4
Biggest number minus	Yes	b	2
Yes	So seven minus	sd	4
So seven minus	Seven minus	sd	2
Jacob	Three fifths is inaudible one half It could be a tie between both	sd	4
Three fifths is inaudible one half It could be a tie between both	But since its since its 35th its a little bit than half	sd	5
But since its since its 35th its a little bit than half	And then if you add it to 14th its closer	sd	5
Who would like to explain that one	inaudible	sd	1
seven eigths is close to what	A whole	sd	4
And 56ths is close to	A whole	sd	4
And inaudible	So its a whole minue a whole	sd	4
Actually turn to a neighbor and tell them why what its closest to	Its closest to inaudiblebecause if you add like the numbers then its close to inaudible	sd	5
Its closest to inaudiblebecause if you add like the numbers then its close to inaudible	Theres Already a one there	sd	5
You all good	Yup	aa	1
And this is about one and two minus one is one	But its the same denominator	sd	4
Yeah	So you would know	aa	4
anybody feel strongly that it should be a half	So  210ths is not 210ths is not that big	sd	4
So  210ths is not 210ths is not that big	So to minus it so its closest to half inauidble	sd	4
Richard you want to explain that	Because so the denominators are really close to inauidble One and both of them plus Inaudible closer to zero inaudiblebe a half which would be like 5 or something	sd	5
Do you have a straight edge	I have one	sd	1
You guys should have does  everybody should have a geometry template right	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yeah	b	1
51 so that should go straight from 81 to 51	inaudible there is another 51	sd	4
Stephanie if you double zero What do you get	Zero	sd	4
Bishop What do you think	I think its going to be bigger	sv	4
What do you mean greater	He said he said bigger	sd	2
Wow	I think its going to be bigger because he had double both coordinates	sd	5
Yeah	So its bigger across and taller	sd	4
Aden can you read it really loudly	Double the first number of the original pair and inaudible	sd	1
What would that whats that sailboat kind of look like Richard	I think it might be a little bigger but a different shape Because youre leaving one the same	sd	5
What do you think Jacob	I think its also be a little bigger but I think its gonna be like a stop sign like up there like smooshed and then its inaudible	sd	4
What do you think Adam	inaudible	sd	1
Aden What do you think	I think its is going to be as tall as the original sailboat but longer	sd	4
Am I right	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I just save mine though	sd	1
I just save mine though	I dont get allowance	sd	1
A sticker costs 75 cents	It says 25	sd	1
How many dollars is that	Its none	sd	4
Its none	Its one dollar	sd	2
Adelle what are your thoughts about that first question	Adelle	sd	1
Oh yes Adelle	I think it would be 25 of a dollar	sd	4
Tell us more	Because a dollar is 100 cents and this sticker 25 cents	sd	5
Because a dollar is 100 cents and this sticker 25 cents	So I think that would be either 25 of a dollar or it could if youre talking about it in a different way it could 14 of a dollar	sd	5
River what would you like to add	Yeah like Adelleaid you could do well you could do 14 you could 25 which would be 25 cents	sd	5
Yeah like Adelleaid you could do well you could do 14 you could 25 which would be 25 cents	And since 4 x 25 and a quarter is 25 cents that would equal one dollar	sd	5
Yes Frankie	You can get 25 you can get hundred divided by four	sd	5
Why did you pick four	Because 25 cents goes into a dollar four times	sd	5
do you want to talk a little bit about that	Yeah because 100 divided by 25 is four and if 14 of a dollar because you need four of them for it to be a whole	sd	5
Yeah because 100 divided by 25 is four and if 14 of a dollar because you need four of them for it to be a whole	So if you have four of them you	sd	5
Did you have anything else you wanted to add	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Do you say it like 25 or 425	sd	3
Mathematically we would actually say 25 hundredths	Oh	b	1
But we might say 25 today just to distinguish between fractions and decimals	What about 25	sd	3
In our class were going to work hard on using place value language	Okay because Ive heard different people say it	sd	1
Yes and people will understand what you mean	Yeah	b	1
Yes Alexa	Well I just want to say that I know its a quarter of a dollar because 25  25 is 50 and thats half a dollar	sd	5
Well I just want to say that I know its a quarter of a dollar because 25  25 is 50 and thats half a dollar	So if we add another two 25s then thats a dollar	sd	5
Carson you were actually my next person	It cost six quarters	sd	4
Six quarters	Yeah	b	1
Wayne what do you think	Well it depends on what cents are counted by but you could do 150 pennies	sd	4
Adelle B what are you thinking	15 dimes	sd	4
Clay how many cents are in one dollar	100	b	4
Archer where have you heard cent before	A percent	sd	4
Absolutely	Hello century is 100	sd	4
100 what Augustus	Century like cent	sd	4
Century like cent	Because I was also watching on the Monday video of Khan Academy that they were talking about cent means century	sd	1
Yeah because a century is 100 years	Well theres	sd	1
Well theres	Wait I kind of forgot what I was going to say	sd	1
Yeah Annabelle	I dont know if this is really related to math but centennial	sd	4
Yeah	What would that mean	sd	3
Thats a celebration that happens every 100 years	I was going to say pretty much the cent for percentage	sd	4
How many legs does a centipede supposedly have	100	b	4
Does anyone think that they know all of the people on these coins	I know one person	sd	1
Blaze do you think you can name them all	Ill try	sd	1
Go for it	The first one is Abraham Lincoln	sd	1
Yep Abraham Lincoln is on the penny	I dont know any of these people	sd	1
Does anyone know the nickel	Would that be George Washington	sd	1
Would that be George Washington	John Kennedy	sd	1
John Kennedy	Thomas Jefferson	sd	1
Thomas Jefferson	Oh I was correct	sd	1
Keep going Blaze	Thats John F Kennedy	sd	1
So on the dime is Franklin Roosevelt	And whos that	sd	1
And whos that	The next ones George Washington	sd	1
How about on the half dollar	It looks like John F Kennedy	sd	1
And then	I have a joke	sd	1
Okay tell your joke	Right now	b	1
Yes you may tell your joke right now	Why is Abraham Lincoln what is it	sd	1
Why is Abraham Lincoln what is it	The number one president	sd	1
The number one president	Why is Abraham Lincoln our first president	sd	1
Why waSt he our first president	No why is he our first president	sd	1
No why is he our first president	Its a joke	sd	1
I dont know	No why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	sd	1
No why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	Sorry	b	1
Why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	Because hes our number one president	sd	1
Do you guys know	ISt there a lot of different ones	sd	1
On this particular one is Sacagawea and she helped guide people through the Louisiana Purchase	I can name all the things on the back	sd	1
So Brett how much is a penny worth	One cent	sd	4
How would we write that as a decimal	05	b	4
And what percentage would that be	Its five percent of a dollar	sd	4
How can we do that with decimals	10	b	4
What percent would it be	10	b	4
Yeah	Ten dimes that equals 100 and 100 ten cents is one dollar	sd	5
Ten dimes that equals 100 and 100 ten cents is one dollar	And so if you earn 10 of ten	sd	5
And so if you earn 10 of ten	Ten is equal to 10 of a hundred	sd	5
Avery how would we write a quarter as a decimal	25	b	4
And then what percentage of a dollar is it	25	b	4
Frankie you are up	50	b	4
50 and how would we write it as a decimal	5	b	4
Archer you have our last one you have a dollar	Wouldnt that just be 1	sd	4
Yeah what percent of a dollar is it	100	b	4
Whatd you say	100	b	4
Im going to switch over what Im presenting so give me just a minute	says 19	sd	1
19 is the page youre going to take a picture of	What page do we go to though	sd	1
Brian and Clay and Alison I would like to see your note catcher and Aiden and Bethany please	Can I have a piece of paper	sd	1
I know that this is already written for you but Im going to use the worlds fastest drying whiteout	Roblox	sd	1
Roblox	Im on mute	sd	1
Yeah Blaze	How did you get 10 going into 10 right after you did it going into 1	sd	3
I know that this is written for you but I think you guys might appreciate it if I go over it with you too	Whats whiteout	sd	1
What	Whats whiteout	sd	1
Its just me coloring with a white pen	ISt it like a product	sd	1
Yeah its like white paint	Oh what do you do with it	ba	1
You can cover mistakes	Because if you use pen if you	sd	1
Because if you use pen if you	It usually comes in a stick or you highlight and then	sd	1
It usually comes in a stick or you highlight and then	But can you write on it after that	sd	1
So in this one we have		b	1
Yeah	Its not really about the money what if there was a remainder	sd	3
So I also need to multiply 2x2 to get to 4	Where did you get it from	sd	3
Where did I get what from	Where did you get the 5 from	sd	3
So Im just trying find the decimal equivalent for 25	Oh so you just picked a number	sd	4
Yeah	that you thought would be closest	sd	4
So 410 and 25 are equivalent and if I have 410 I can put a 4 in the tenths place and those two will be equivalent	Could you just do it mentally too	sd	1
I just want to show you why it works	Okay	b	1
I want to see you guys writing that down in your note catcher please	Wait can you give us	sd	1
Wait can you give us	Im not  Can you give us the definition of parts	sd	3
So if you have a whole and you split it up into different sections	Oh I see	aa	1
Oh I see	Its kind of like a part of it	sd	4
Its kind of like a part of it	Okay	b	1
Three will go into 10 three times	But wouldnt it be 11 there because	sd	4
Because I brought down my zero	No for the last one because if you have the 10 and 9 you still have to bring the 1  Oh wait never mind	sd	5
No for the last one because if you have the 10 and 9 you still have to bring the 1  Oh wait never mind	Sorry	b	1
So  What Alexa	You got 10 the first time wouldnt you the 100 and then the 1000 the next time	sd	5
Because I could get it to go into 10	Oh okay	b	1
We know that the 3 is just going to keep happening so were finished	Oh wait is the 3 going to happen because its 13 and thats a repeating	sd	5
Correct yes	Okay	b	1
All right	So if its 13 repeating	sd	4
Archer what are your thoughts	What you could do is on a ratio table since you can do either the up and down but still being the exact same numerator and denominator  Well not exact same but almost the same thing	sd	5
Yeah you can go up or down yeah	You can multiply it by 5 or by whatever you need to to get the denominator to 100 to see what the numerators number is and that will be	sd	5
Campbell what would you like to add	You could have just said to make it easier and mental you could have just said how many times does 2 go into 10 and that would be the 2x510 then you add another zero which would between 100 and then 3 goes in 15 times 5x3 is 15	sd	5
Yeah absolutely	We could have just set those by 20 100	sd	4
Yeah	Wouldnt it be important to add that zero in there	sd	4
Wouldnt it be important to add that zero in there	Or does it really not matter	sd	1
You mean in the ones place	Yeah	b	1
Lets go into the thousandths place	Its just going to start repeating again	sd	4
It is going to start repeating again because 6 will go into 40 six times	Just to make sure you probably want to do it a few more times but theres not a lot of	sd	4
Yeah	I forgot	sd	1
All right Brett what is one that you would like to fill in	I can do the first one	sd	1
I can do the first one	I think that the first box would be  Well I waSt sure if it was 3 or 5	sd	4
Catalina what are you thinking	I think its 5 because 5 is half of 10	sd	5
Yes Alison	I think that is 15	sv	4
Annabelle what were some other ones you knew	The third one	sd	4
Are those fourths	Yes	b	1
Okay go for it	The first one I think its 25	sv	4
Tell us how you figured that out	Because its 14 of 100 or 1	sd	5
Because its 14 of 100 or 1	And then the next one is 75	sd	5
River do you want to tell us one you figured out	I think the very last one would be 1 first	sd	4
I think the very last one would be 1 first	Yeah and the next one would be 3 or 03	sd	4
Yeah and the next one would be 3 or 03	The next one would be 7	sd	4
Yeah	And the next one 09	sd	4
Carson	I know the 15	sd	4
Yeah whats 15	Its 2	sd	4
We didnt talk about that one together	Because I just did 10 2  because 5 is just 2 times or 5x2 is 10	sd	5
So Carson if every time we add 15 we add 2 what would 25 be	4 6 and then 8	sd	5
Yeah Alison	I think I have one figured out	sd	1
Which one you like to add	I knew the fifth one	sd	1
Which fraction is that	The 16	sd	4
Sure whats 16 going to be	Sorry the sixth	sd	4
Sorry the sixth	That one	sd	4
What is 16 going to be	It would be 16	sd	4
So yeah we can definitely		b	1
So thats just a trick to help you remember it	Are all 6s like that	sd	4
Alison what else did you have to add sweetie	The next one will be 83	sd	4
Yeah how did you get that one	Because I used the 10 and then add 6	sd	5
Frankie what would 13 be	Well I wrote it as 34 but then the 6 goes on so I dont know how to write that	sd	3
So Frankie can I ask you a followup question	Yes	b	1
If we know that 13 is 3 repeating what do you think 23 is going to be	6	b	4
Add one more thing to a 6	Repeating	sd	4
Yeah River	I was going ask if I could do the last one	sd	1
Are we looking at eights	Yeah	b	1
Lets do it	Okay so I think the 18 would be I think it would be 01 for that one	sv	4
And then Catalina	For the 28 even though that doeSt have box you can still figure out that that would be 250	sd	4
So what would 38 be then	I dont know	sd	3
Catalina what do you think	365	b	4
Can you tell us how you got that	125 plus 125 is 250 plus another 125 is 750	sd	5
Which one you like to do 58 or 78	58	b	4
Okay whats 58 going to be	I think its 695	sv	4
What do you think Alexa	550	b	4
Annabelle what are your thoughts	I forget its either 565 or 665	sd	4
Carson do you want to do the last one for us	Sure	b	1
Sure	I got 873	sd	4
Yeah	I think theres a pattern	sd	4
Whats the pattern Augustus	Nevermind I dont think there is	sd	4
You just did some major inspiration here	I see 125 then I see 75 then I see 25 then I see 75 and then the numbers also change by 200	sd	5
I see 125 then I see 75 then I see 25 then I see 75 and then the numbers also change by 200	I think you add 200 each time	sv	5
Yeah Carson	Do we still have to take a picture of this	sd	1
So go ahead and get started labeling your pizzas	Okay so I drew the things	sd	1
Okay so I drew the things	So I got the  down	sd	1
So I got the  down	Its a little noisy on my side	sd	1
Okay so what do you guys think you might start out with	Well I think	sv	1
Emmett you can go	Okay	b	1
Okay	I think that you could divide the pizzas	sv	4
I think that you could divide the pizzas	Well Im going to start with the three pictures and five kids and five people	sd	2
Well Im going to start with the three pictures and five kids and five people	So I think that would be each person gets um	sd	2
Liam do you have a question	I started dividing them out and each of them gets one Well theres still four pieces of pizza left	sd	4
Okay so for the first one how many pizzas were there	There were	sd	1
You did what	I accidentally divided the river by five	sd	4
So what would be a good strategy to divide those pizzas	For the first problem	sd	1
I dont know what happened	Can you hear me now	sd	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	So the for the four students at the Forest Preserve	sd	5
So the for the four students at the Forest Preserve	And I started by dividing the fractions into fourths	sd	5
And I started by dividing the fractions into fourths	And each student got three fourths of the pizza	sd	5
Okay	I agree	aa	2
Okay	Okay so in the corner	sd	1
Hows it going	Good	ba	1
Can you guys turn your cameras on	Sure	b	1
Okay and where have you gotten so far	Um were on to question one right now	sd	1
Okay and where you have the three pizzas and how many people are sharing those three pizzas	If we have three pizzas there is four student sharing in Forest Preserve five students sharing four pizzas at the corn field	sd	4
Hunter whats your idea	Um maybe like the first two we can divide it into one like well in half and then the last one divided into one fourth	sd	5
Do you guys agree with that	Yeah	b	2
How much would those four students get if you did that	They would get	sd	1
Okay Im going to share my camera and see if if I have my three pizzas here and Hunter said divide the first two in half and divide the last one in fourths because we have four people sharing so they would get one half	A half and a fourth	sd	4
What do you know	Yeah	b	1
When you think about fourths how many fourths equal a half	Oh	b	1
Oh so what do you think Hunter	It might be two fourths	sd	4
So instead of saying a half and a fourth you could say	Three fourths	sd	4
Are both ways correct	Yeah	b	2
How many pieces	They share	sd	1
They share	Five students share four pizzas	sd	4
If theres five students what could you do with each pizza	You could divide it into	sd	1
Hey guys which one are you on	Cornfield	sd	1
And how many students are sharing how many pizzas	And were on the one that has four pizzas and five students	sd	4
Go ahead Lacey	I say we should split all of them in fifths	sd	4
I say we should split all of them in fifths	Like a rectangle	sd	4
What would you do	I had the same idea	sd	2
And what would you do to figure out how much each student gets then once you put each one into fifths	Theyd each get four fifths	sd	4
Gordon what are we looking at next	To the meadow	sd	1
And then how many how many students are sharing pizza in the meadow	I didnt have like the exact amount but I do know they have eight pizzas or they have seven pizzas	sd	4
Lacey did you get an answer	Maybe seven eighths	sd	4
Gordon what is seven eighths almost	Its almost a whole	sd	4
Its almost a whole	Its almost one	sd	2
Yeah because the whole would be how many pieces	Eight	sd	4
Lacy what did you get	Three fifths for each	sd	4
Gordon what are you thinking	Im thinking maybe seven eighths	sd	4
And why do you think seven eighths	Because its almost a whole	sd	5
Frankie	Four fifths	aa	5
Four fifths	Because seven eighths movie like smaller slivers and four fifths would be bigger ones	sd	5
What are you thinking	I think that seven eighths maybe bigger because theyre a littler pieces but it still makes a big whole	sd	5
Which ones bigger	Probably four fifths	sd	4
Which one appears to be bigger to you Zack	They look like theyre equal	sd	4
Gordon	Seven eighths	sd	4
Im going to pop in another room quickly	He was the last question	sd	1
How are you guys doing	Good	ba	1
Good	But um we dont really understand the second question	sd	3
What did you guys figure out	Um we thought it was forest preserve	sd	5
Um we thought it was forest preserve	Because because it has four pizzas and three	sd	5
Because because it has four pizzas and three	It has four students and three pizzas	sd	5
It has four students and three pizzas	And if we divided divided two pizzas into halves then each students out of the four students would get a half	sd	5
And if we divided divided two pizzas into halves then each students out of the four students would get a half	And then we divided the third circle pizza into fourths because then each of the four students would get one fourth	sd	5
And then we divided the third circle pizza into fourths because then each of the four students would get one fourth	And then each student would have three fourths	sd	5
Ill be back	And then we can go	sd	1
And then we can go	Okay so	b	1
Hey guys hows it going	Good	ba	1
Good	We just didnt really understand the second question thatnwe didnt know what we were	sd	3
Which one did you figure out was the biggest and why	The four students that went to the forest preserve	sd	4
And so they were sharing how many pizzas		b	4
Okay	Yeah	b	1
Think about which fraction is closest to a whole and why	Seven eighths	sd	4
Why do you Oh Liam go ahead	I think closer because because the little squares are smaller so if it was smaller theyd technically be closer	sd	5
Which one has the most shaded in boys and girls	The meadow	sd	4
Kenneth what are you thinkingOut of those four fractions which one would be the next biggest	Probably four fifths	sd	4
Why do you think four fifths	Because four fifths are have would be closer than three fourths	sd	5
Which one do you think is bigger Three fourths or three fifths	Three fourths	sd	4
Liam what did you say before about seven eighths	I said seven eighths is closer because theres more tiny little pieces and this huge one	sd	5
So I will join another group quickly and see how theyre doing	Three pizzas	sd	4
Three pizzas	Okay	b	1
Okay	I am going to backspace	sd	1
I am going to backspace	Yes	b	1
Hey Mariana how are you guys doing	Check	sd	1
Check	We finished question one and question two	sd	1
What did you get for question one	We got that greatest pizza was the eight students that had the seven pizzas	sd	4
How did you get that	We got that because were looking at our diagram	sd	5
We got that because were looking at our diagram	All the other ones were smaller than the seven and the eight	sd	5
And seven eighths is closest to what	Seven eighths is closer to 10	sd	4
Yes Parker	I realized something	sd	1
Whats that	Four and five and four also yeah four out of five that thats also the same and three out of four	sd	5
Four and five and four also yeah four out of five that thats also the same and three out of four	So thats also the same	sd	5
Which one do you think is bigger	I say five sixths	sd	4
Im going to actually call us by Max what did you get for number one and why do you think its the biggest	So Ive picked that for number one wild meadow is the biggest because seven eighths if you do that its just a small sliver left of our pizza	sd	5
Lacy	I think that seven eighths is bigger because theyre for example four fifths it has much more left over than the seven eighths	sd	5
Mariana	So what I did for number two was hold on	sd	1
So what I did for number two was hold on	I did	sd	1
I did	Things being glitchy	sd	1
Things being glitchy	Okay there we go	sd	1
Okay there we go	Is my diagram is I have four students with three pizzas five students with four pizzas eight students with seven pizzas and five students with three pizzas	sd	5
Kenna	We did seven eighths is greater than four fifths four fifths is greater than three fourths and then three fourths is greater than three fifths	sd	5
Frankie do you want to share your explanation	For which one	sd	1
How do we know seven eighths is bigger than four fifths	I thought that four I thought that four fifths would is bigger would be bigger because they would have bigger slices then seven eighths	sd	5
What did we actually figure out	That was seven eighths because it had a bigger whole	sd	5
It feels hot in here today	Are you recording this to send to the district	sd	1
I do it for fun	Youre taking pictures for proof too	sd	1
Yes	Its really hot in here	sd	1
All right lets be a good audience	Its pretty much asking what this dot means and is the speed and if the speed is zero so at the bottom of the panel	sd	1

You want a poll of the class and see if they agree with you or not	What do you all think	qy	1
Why do you think that less than two out of every three high school juniors got that question right and you guys were all like	D is kind of confusing because of the way the graph looks it doesnt look like that little tip would be the top	sd	5
D is kind of confusing because of the way the graph looks it doesnt look like that little tip would be the top	When you associate the top of a roller coaster if you think of something like that	sv	5
Go ahead	The first thing I looked at was the fact that thats a positive one and a negative six so I knew that those two couldnt be possibilities just because it flips in terms of the time	sd	5
The first thing I looked at was the fact that thats a positive one and a negative six so I knew that those two couldnt be possibilities just because it flips in terms of the time	I looked between C and E and then I got to a conclusion that it was all squared that has to be squared so I tried 182 and got	sd	5
Lets see if the disagrees or the agrees are correct	I disagree on the basis that I chose	sd	2
That one must be heavy	That sounds about right  50 chance to get it wrong	sd	4
If you put a circle on a grid and you put a dot on that circle no matter where you are at as that dot goes around the circle whats not going to change	The diameter	sd	4
What should always be true no matter where youre at around the circle	Radius is the same	sd	4
Look at him	For this one when the denominator is bigger than the top we realize that when thing is divided is getting really closer and closer to zero but its never going to meet	sd	5
Do you need to write anything up here to support words coming out of your mouth	I can write something	sd	1
I can write something	Hes explaining Im just going to write while you continue to explain	sd	2
Hes explaining Im just going to write while you continue to explain	Put one 10	sd	4
Put one 10	If X equals am I doing this right	sd	4
If X equals am I doing this right	Yes	b	2
Yes	Actually you just did a ton of test numbers basically two three 10	sd	2
For what are you testing them	We tested on just this X	sd	4
We tested on just this X	Or if  is dividing something like that if he stays there and I shorten the distance from where Im at and I do it again and continually go Hes getting closer but Ill never actually reach him	sd	5
Or if  is dividing something like that if he stays there and I shorten the distance from where Im at and I do it again and continually go Hes getting closer but Ill never actually reach him	Its always giving me a close to zero but its	sd	5

Guys keep your focus up at the front please	We didnt get far but we used this illustration  restriction on the Y	sd	5
We didnt get far but we used this illustration  restriction on the Y	If there is a restriction on Y then you cant go past  it just then goes up and down	sd	5
Yes this is a big but the bigness of this compared to the bigness of this means this is the only thing thats important and  anything divided by a giant number it gets closer and closer and closer to	Zero	sd	4
That makes sense	Yes	b	1
Yes	Basically the way that works is you ignore the small numbers	sv	5

Im going to put three down	You right you right	b	2
Okay if you guys agree stand up	Oh yeah	b	1
Oh yeah	Wait	sd	1
Wait	Ten yeah	b	4
I want you to think how did you figure this out Eli	I counted two threes and then I got to twelve	sd	5
I counted two threes and then I got to twelve	I knew that was two thirds because three times four equals twelve	sd	5
I knew that was two thirds because three times four equals twelve	So I did three times four	sd	5
So I did three times four	I knew that was twelve then I saw there was eleven so I subtracted one so then I knew it was three and two thirds	sd	5
Really loud	Three times two is six so you start of with six thirds	sd	5
Three times two is six so you start of with six thirds	You add two thirds to make it eight thirds	sd	5
The answer should have been two and two fifths Logan	Because you can only fit five into seven one time	sd	5
Okay	And that would give it another whole	sd	4
Theyre going to be different so justify your answer	How did you get that	sd	3
How did you get that	Sixteen seventeen	sd	4
Seven and three halves	Yeah	b	1
Im sorry	Three	sd	4
Sierra	Eight and one half	sd	4
Okay	Ethan said you guys werent interesting and exciting	sd	1

Everybody say extrapolate	Extrapolate	sd	1
What do you guys think	Three point seven but on here its seven point three	sd	4
Three point seven but on here its seven point three	And then seven point eleven its eleven point seven and then the rest is right	sd	4
So Abigailla did she write them correctly	She wrote the first one	sd	4
Whats wrong with the second one	The second one is backwards	sd	4
The second one is backwards	So you do horizontal and then vertical	sd	4
Fletcher	I noticed that all the ages are four years apart and not five	sd	5
Sure	Do we connect them	sd	1
What would the next one be	Three seven	sd	4
So what you should have noticed is that you could draw a straight line through Lilith and Noahs ages and why is there a straight line relationship Fletcher	They go up by two	sd	5
So its because Lilith always what	By two	sd	5
Avery	Lilith has more ages	sd	4
So what happened	Lilith is older by four years	sd	4
Avery are you going to say something weird	Technically your age can change because the younger person can have a birthday and get older but then you wont have a birthday	sd	1
Thats not how your age works	Yes	b	1
Margo stop doing what youre doing and tell us why you put seven and eight tens	I put seven and eight tens because	sd	1
We know that which digit is in the 10th place	Eight	sd	4
Weve got a lot of people that got this one wrong so we want to make sure that were understanding why what digit is in the 10th place	The eight	sd	4
All right good we agreed on that one that it was zero and nine	10th	b	4
All right Alexander tell me why you put two and seven 10th	Because you have to round this to the nearest 10th and at the 100th place theres a five and five is more I forgot what is the word and that now you make it into two and seven 10th	sd	5
Okay zero and everybody say what it is	68 100th	b	4
Show all right pretty good everybody read what you wrote	7 and 289 1000th	sd	4
Hey we have some different answers out there let see Vicki tell me what you got dont erase you guys	I got 8 and 294 1000th	sd	4
Howd you get that	For the eight you round up right	sd	4
Mrs Baker	Yes	b	1
What digit is in the 1000th place	The three	sd	4
The three so you looked at the	Eight	sd	4
Eight and you knew what	I round it up to the five as well	sd	4
Everybody read what they have	8 and 294 1000th	sd	4
Shylows going to tell us how she got seven	I saw that in the 10th	sd	1
Speak up	I saw that in the 10th place there is a nine so I looked next door and also another nine if you rounded it up there it has to be	sd	5

Our learning targets are basically the same theres one change to adding and subtracting decimals we are adding one symbol anybody know what it is	Zero	sd	4
Zero	The thing left with 1000	sd	4
A symbol its not a number its a symbol	A dollar sign	sd	4
Yes	for money if it goes over a hundred then its a dollar	sd	5
Im looking around Im seeing some correct digits but not the right answer	What	ba	1
Im seeing correct digits but not the right answer how is that possible	I dont know how	sd	1
Lets see Hudson what did you and your partner talk about in terms of when you just saw it what did you know you had to do	Oh we had to add 17 cents to 146	sd	4
How did you know that you had to add	Its because it said I found 17 cents underneath the couch cushion now I have to add into my PiggyBank	sd	5
Jacob what was your answer that you got when you added those two together	162	b	4
What was I talking about when I said you have the right digits but not the right answer MarcSamantha	Some people didnt put the money sign	sd	4
They got that sheet back there with you	Okay	b	1
Hey I am asking person two tell me not the answer tell me what you are doing to get the answer what do you know you have to do	You gave out the 20 and then the thing is 1219 you subtract 1219 from 20	sd	4
This what you wrote out makes sense its changing is this what you wrote out	Yes	b	1
Minus yes	Yes	b	1
Which is whats happening when youve been given change a lot of times when people give you change youll notice that theyre counting up when they give you the change back do you notice that	Yes	b	1
Somebody take me through the process Ill call on somebody person four all right take me through the process  shhh	What Ill do first is do the zeros you  since you cant do that youll would have to borrow form the two making that a one I just skipped the process of making it a 10 then making it a nine by just making it a nine because the first two zeros is nine then the last zero is 10	sd	5
What Ill do first is do the zeros you  since you cant do that youll would have to borrow form the two making that a one I just skipped the process of making it a 10 then making it a nine by just making it a nine because the first two zeros is nine then the last zero is 10	Now that weve got all the borrowing now it will be 10 minus 9 which is 1 9 minus 1 which is 8 9 minus 2 which is 7 and 1 minus 1 is nothing	sd	5
How much change do we get back	781	b	4
Theres my number model for you you take three do you need one of the cards	No	b	1
If you get the same answer awesome if you get different answers go through dont erase but look carefully at your process and see whats going on	Yes I got 40 50	sd	4
Yes I got 40 50	Because its two weeks	sd	5
You guys dont have the same answer	No he doesnt have the same answer	sd	2
No you dont  something up  it looks like its part of the five	Yes	b	1
All right Brody that means youre out there	Yes here we go now	sd	1
All right 17 what did you get	I got 4056	sd	4
4056	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Its just a number that its called the value its holding the value you could take T equals then this whatever it is	My head hurts	sd	1
Why are we waiting	I need subtraction by	sd	4
Person 21	Thats me	ba	1
All right what did you get	I got 2597	sd	4
Anybody feeling brave and want to explain why this is or is not a function	I can	sd	1
What do you think Rylee	I think this is a function because all of the domain numbers each one only has one arrow pointing not two arrows or any more than one	sd	5
How does that sound	That sounds good	sv	1
Okay now lets see everybodys circleYes	Yay	sd	1
Go ahead	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I just saw the opportunity And I took it	sd	1
Thats not good Either	Mine is working	sd	1
Why did you say this was not a function	I said it wasnt a function	sd	5
I said it wasnt a function	Because the graph I noticed on the graph that when theres a line like the graph the land will touch two points at the same time	sd	5
Because the graph I noticed on the graph that when theres a line like the graph the land will touch two points at the same time	I said no because theres only one domain and theyre all pointing at five different numbers	sd	5
I said no because theres only one domain and theyre all pointing at five different numbers	And we already know that the domains cant have more than one arrow to be a function	sd	5
Illtalk to you soon	Thank you bye	aa	1
Yeah Deacon go ahead	I went to a furniture and  it was like the last day and they were trying to do a really big sale	sd	1
Or did they just say its a big sale	I wasnt paying attention too much but	sd	1
Did you guys get any new furniture	Not yet we were just looking around	sd	1
Like at the mall Yeah Bill	Well I didnt really see any but my parents went furniture shopping because they said there were a bunch of sales	sd	1
Yeah	Were getting a new house so were looking for new furniture	sd	1
Do you want to give us a fraction equivalent for 10 25 50 or 75	Sorry I turned my camera on instead of my microphone	sd	1
Sorry I turned my camera on instead of my microphone	10 maybe	sd	4
Okay whats the fraction equivalent for 10	You could do ten hundredths	sd	4
Okay Bronwyn do you agree with that disagree with that or have a question about what were learning	I couldnt hear I cant really hear that	sd	1
Can you hear me	Yeah I can hear you	sd	1
She said ten onehundredths	Yeah I agree with that	sd	2
Caleb are you going to tell us	You could do one over 10	sd	4
Christie do you want to do 25 50 or 75	I could do 25 since its the next one	sd	1
All right what fraction would that be equivalent to	Im not exactly sure but could it be 25 over 100	sd	4
Okay Bronwyn do you agree disagree or have a question	I have a question how	sd	3
I have a question how	I dont know	sd	3
I dont know	I just dont really understand that	sd	3
So you started with how can you finish your sentence for how	How did she get 25 over 100	sd	3
Christie how did you get 25 over 100	I got 25 over 100 because 100 can go under 25	sd	5
Robert do you want to take that one	Because if you have a whole which is 100 and you take 25 of that it would be 25 from 100	sd	5
Franc what would you like to add	Because the percent sign percent means 100 and  that percent means 100	sd	5
Deacon what do you think	25 is also one quarter	sd	4
Bill which one would you like to do	Ill do 75	sd	1
Lets hear it	Three fourths	sd	4
Do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	aa	2
How do you know thats right	Because 75 is three fourths of 100	sd	5
How do you know that its 34s	Because of 25 50 75	sd	5
Alfie what do you think	I think its equivalent to one half	sd	4
What are your thoughts there	I agree that 50 is equivalent to one half of 100	sd	2
Yeah because 50 is half of a hundred	Yeah hes right	aa	2
So go ahead and hop on Forest in your Google Classroom today	Theres two Forest	sd	1
Its Jasper for you	Which Forest should I use	sd	1
So not the benchmark fractions one	Is it a Forest	sd	1
For the green one what percent is shaded in and how do you know	Because that would be one tenth and one tenth is	sd	5
Because that would be one tenth and one tenth is	Ten goes into 100 ten times you also do 1 x 10	sd	5
What did you say what percent shaded in	I said 50	sd	4
How did you know that it was 50	Because if you	sd	1
Because if you	I did it as a fraction at first I got one half or one over two	sd	5
I did it as a fraction at first I got one half or one over two	And so I thought whats half of 100 and I got 50	sd	5
Can you tell us what fraction or what percent is shaded in	75	b	4
How did you get 75	and then they added one more	sd	4
Howd we do	I have a question on B	sd	3
Sure	So is it since its half that means its 50	sd	4
Yeah just like Nash said and Leslie said that half of a hundred is 50	Oh okay	b	1
Im going to have MNashna can you read your response that you wrote on slide three	I wrote  divided by two so when you divide by two its easier to find 50	sd	5
Kabir P will you also read yours	All you have to do is halve the number because 50 is half of 100	sd	5
And Joanna will you read your response	I said Just go back	sd	1
I said Just go back	50 means half so you can just divide the number by two	sd	5
So Im going to start with Meredith Meredith can you read your strategy for how you found 10 of something	So to find 10 I just divided the number by 10	sd	5
So to find 10 I just divided the number by 10	So if you divide 10 by 10 for 10 liters of milk you get one	sd	5
Deacon what is 10 of a 2000 kilometer trip what would that be	That would be 200	sd	4
Yeah what would 10 of a 24 hour day be	Like 2	sd	4
If you divide 24 by 10 what would we get	24	b	4
Yeah Alfie	I cant do the share with the class thing because my computer doesnt let me	sd	1
So dont write anything new	Im a little confused	sd	3
Yeah whats up Bronwyn	Im just confused on how you got 24	sd	3
So now the 2 that was in the 10s place is in the 1s place	Oh okay	b	1
And the 4 that was in the 1s place is in the tenths place	And then 10 is the hour but why would you divide them by 10 not 2	sd	3
Because were finding 10	Oh	b	1
Does that make sense	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Thank you	aa	1
Well go back to this picture in yellow its 75	You could divide by three	sd	4
And Kalen that would give us what one fourth would be	25	b	4
25	And then you can multiply it by three	sd	4
So Kalen what was your first step to be able to find 75	Divide the first number by four	sd	4
What was your next step Kalen	Multiply the number you got from dividing by four times three	sd	4
Well check it will it mark it right if you write it like that	Yeah it does	sd	1
So Meredith will you help me with the first one	Sorry can you repeat that	sd	1
Can you help me with the first one	Yeah so I did 10 divided by 75 and I got 75	sd	5
So lets do this lets do 10 divided by 4 what would 10 divided by 4 be	10 divided by 4 would be	sd	1
And sometimes when I divide by four I like to divide it in half and then divide my half in half again	Okay that would be 25	sd	4
Absolutely so thats one fourth	And then you would multiply by three	sd	4
And what would that be	That would be 75	sd	4
With the 2000 kilometer trip	Im just not really sure how to do it	sd	3
So what would 20 divided by 4 be	5	b	4
So then were going to take 500 and multiply it by 3 and what would that give us	300	b	4
Does that make sense Nadia	Yeah	b	1
All right the next one there Kabir P can you walk us through how to find three fourths of a 24 hour day	Okay so you divide 24 by 4 getting 6 and then 6 times 3 is 18	sd	5
Kaysen Im not sure what youre pasting into the answer boxes but it doesnt look like what were up to right now okay	Oh I have an answer I just need to answer	sd	1
Are you there Magnus	Yeah Im thinking	sd	1
What would that be	150 maybe	sd	4
What would the whole be	18	b	4
So if I go back to my first slide and I say okay 10 is equal to 9	T half of 9 wouldnt it be 45	sd	4
So if you take 18 and you find 50 of it that would be 9	Oh	b	1
Lets see Deacon what do you think	That would be 100	sd	4
That would be 100	Wait are we on C	sd	1
Im on C yeah	So 100 would be	sd	1
So 100 would be	So do you want me to find 100 or 10	sd	3
So if 9 is 10 what number would be 100	That would be 90	sd	4
Kalen you are on a streak my friend what do you think	I got 36	sd	4
Okay howd you get 36	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	So I did 100 divided by 4	sd	4
So I did 100 divided by 4	I solved this really strange	sd	1
Would you like to share your idea Leslie	Yeah I did 9 times 4	sd	4
Right that is a great strategy why did you do 9 times 4	Because 25 times 4 is 100	sd	5
Because 25 times 4 is 100	And so	sd	1
So what are you thinking Alfie	I really dont know	sd	3
What do you guys think	I think you would add	sv	4
So please be thoughtful you have like two minutes to let me know give me a specific example	You break it up into steps	sd	4
You break it up into steps	Eli	b	1
Eli	50 x 6  350	b	5
50 x 6  350	He got the 300  500 6 times then he got	sd	2
He got the 300  500 6 times then he got	Yes	b	1
Yes	I knew 10 x 5 was 50 and then 5 x 6 is 300 so 300 and it would be 50 off	sd	5
I knew 10 x 5 was 50 and then 5 x 6 is 300 so 300 and it would be 50 off	The answer would be 50	sd	5
The answer would be 50	Have the dollar sign	sd	4
Have the dollar sign	We still got to do	sd	1

Ella and	She did 10 times 4 is 4o	sd	5
She did 10 times 4 is 4o	9 times 4 is 36	sd	5
9 times 4 is 36	Then Im guessing she did She went over here and did 76 times 76 plus 76 is 152	sd	5
Then Im guessing she did She went over here and did 76 times 76 plus 76 is 152	She did 152 plus 152 is 304	sd	5

Yes because I did my estimate	I changed the 19 which Im guessing I should maybe take out maybe I might keep it	sd	5
I changed the 19 which Im guessing I should maybe take out maybe I might keep it	I changed it to a 20	sd	5
I changed it to a 20	First my estimate I did 2 times 4 is 8 8 times 4 is 32	sd	5
First my estimate I did 2 times 4 is 8 8 times 4 is 32	Times 20 and then I did this here	sd	5
Times 20 and then I did this here	Then I got 640 and for my actual problem I did 2 times 4 is 8 times 4 is 32	sd	5
Then I got 640 and for my actual problem I did 2 times 4 is 8 times 4 is 32	Then I changed it to 19 which was the students and then I did this	sd	5
Then I changed it to 19 which was the students and then I did this	Then I did 300 270 which got 570 plus 20 590	sd	5
Then I did 300 270 which got 570 plus 20 590	Plus 18 is 608	sd	5
Plus 18 is 608	Then I found that 608 and 640 are close together	sd	5
Then I found that 608 and 640 are close together	You should say take 640 even though it costs 608 so you get 32 back	sv	5
You should say take 640 even though it costs 608 so you get 32 back	Instead of going to 640 he could have just gone to 610 and that would have been easier 610 instead of 640	sd	2
Instead of going to 640 he could have just gone to 610 and that would have been easier 610 instead of 640	No I was just saying	sd	1
No I was just saying	I write that and then Ill change it to make it a little better	sd	4
Then can you guys make it better	Can we say that we kind of agree	sd	1

What is that mean partially filled	The remainder	sd	4
First of all do we agree with this persons answer	Wait because I wanted to ask Ian	sd	1
Okay Auden whats your first step when youre solving a problem like that	I bBillieeve our answer	sd	2
For a problem like that whats your first step	The answer is five	sd	4
The answer is five	I agree with that	sd	2
I agree with that	The answer is five	sd	4
What is the question	How much	sd	4
How much	With the remainder of five or the answer is five	sd	4
All right lets start that way	The answer is five	sd	4
How many are in each	Five sixes	sd	4
If we had six here six here six here and six here how many do we have so far	30 because 6 times 7 equals 35	sd	5
30 because 6 times 7 equals 35	No 5 times 7 equals 35	sd	2
Yes	6 times 7 equals 42	sd	5
Are we 47 quite yet	No were not	sd	4
Do you think we can fit another carrot on each tray	6 times six equals	sd	4
If we have 42 on the trays so far how many do we have left out of 47	Is six times six equals 26	sd	5
What happens to those five	Wait does it ask for the remainder	sd	1
Wait does it ask for the remainder	I know	aa	1
Does it say that they get thrown in the trash	The farmer	sd	4
Do they get on trays	There are five carrots on the partiallyfilled	sd	4
There are five carrots on the partiallyfilled	Six times seven	sd	4
Martin	47 divide by 6	sd	4
How do we know its asking us 47 divided by 6	Because it says the farmers have 47 apples into trays	sd	5
Has anyone caught my mistake	Yes	b	1
Whats my mistake Tiffany	Instead of apples at the end you put carrots	sd	1
Yes there we go	It transformed with magic	sd	1
Mathias	Partial quotients	sd	4
I can say 6 x 1	6 x 7  4	b	5
6 x 3		b	4
Mathias	6 x 7	sd	4
What is 67 Mathias		b	4
Can I fit six into five	No	b	1
No so what does that tell me five is	Remainder	sd	4
Vanessa	Long division	sd	4
Mohammad how did you start solving this problem	By using lots of circle and then by pictures	sd	4
Now we know our answer we know that I can fill how many full trays	Seven	sd	4
Seven	Seven	sd	2
What answer am I looking for Whittny	The remainder	sd	4
How do you know that	Because it says how many carrots are on the partially filled tray	sd	5
How many carrots are on the partially filled tray	Whats partially	sd	3
If we dont know what partially means then are we able to solve this problem	No	b	1
Baker why dont you give it a shot what	Parts of something	sd	4
It is partially filled if Im saying that Bergen brought in this container of maple sausage pancakes partially filled does that mean its full	No	b	1
Im sorry what part of my answer	Remainder	sd	4
My remainder because this right here seven remainder five means that I have filled how many full trays	Seven	sd	4
First of all do we agree with their answer	No	b	1
They said To solve this problem I divided 47 divided by six therefore I know 47 divided by six equals seven and 56 because of the question	No	b	1
Is the answer 7 and 56	No	b	1
Sorry rewrite this answer	I said to solve this problem 47 divided by six I got seven remainder five so that means the answer is five	sd	5
I said to solve this problem 47 divided by six I got seven remainder five so that means the answer is five	Therefore I know the farmer put five carrots on the partially filled tray	sd	5
To solve this problem 47 divided by six	I got seven remainder five	sd	4
Martin do you have a question	Yes	b	1
Yes whats your question	Why is that there	sd	3
Why is what there	The little circle up there	sd	3
Are you just trying to be funny	No	b	1
Because when you laugh when youre saying it that could tell me that youre trying to be funny and is now a good time to be funny in math class	No	b	1
What makes this answer better than the one that I had written up there Baker	Because it has more detail	sd	5
Why else Myles	It has more dots	sd	5
I really wish that we could pay attention and listen Mathias	It makes more sense	sd	5
Whittny	They have the right answer	sd	5
Tiffany	It has more details and its the remainder of how much the farmer put	sd	5
It has more details and its the remainder of how much the farmer put	What	ba	1
What	on the partially filled tray	sd	1
All right now were going to completely switch gears a little bit and were going to get moving	Yay	sd	1
Blake are you done writing this	Yes	b	1
You guys know what an angle is right	Yes	b	1
What are some things that we know about angles Martin	They are something that you use to measure	sd	4
Okay we can measure them what else Tiffany	There are a few angles obtuse right angles straight angles	sd	4
Whittny what else	Its a measurement	sd	4
Its a measurement we can measure them Auden	Its a type of angle like a clock like that	sd	4
Its a type of angle like a clock like that	Its like and angle is like that	sd	4
I have these really long ropes	Whoa	sd	1
Mathias and Auden do you guys want to help me for a second	Yes	b	1
Whittny	Vertex	sd	4
Who is the vertex right now	You	aa	4
Why am I the vertex of this angle Patrick	Because youre like the point in between the other two points	sd	5
Right now Mathias Auden what kind of angle have we produced	Acute angle	sd	4
Auden why is this an acute angle	Because its shaping like a mouth	sd	5
Its a mouth but its what kind of mouth the bigger or a small mouth	A big mouth	sd	4
Big mouth	No a small mouth	sd	4
They are less than Phillip	90 degrees	sd	4
They are less than 90 degrees so everyone give me an L This is 90 degrees if it is smaller than this it is	An acute	sd	4
If it is bigger it is	An Obtuse	sd	4
One two three Bergen come here	Me	sd	1
If yours looks like this what is it	A right angle	b	4
All right big angles are bigger than what	90 degrees	sd	4
What is 90 degrees	A right angle	b	4
What kind of angle	Right	b	4
Everyone look at your angle does it look like a right angle	Yes	b	1
All right I want you to make a straight angle	Straight angle	sd	1
One more I want you to make an angle smaller than 90 degrees	Acute angle	sd	4
If I gave you a picture of a graph would you be able to answer the question what is the domain of that graph	Yes	b	1
As I go across this thing and I m looking for legal x s are all of the x s allowed to be put into this function	No	b	1
What x is that		b	4
3 so this thing doesn t exist at 3 and again it doesn t exist at 5 so you need a way to tell me if I ask you this question all real numbers except 4	3 and 5	sd	4
There s a bunch of ways you can do it	You said less than five	sd	4
5	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Sorry	sd	1
Sorry	Tractor tractor tractor tractor	sd	1
If we asked you to do in interval notation and you did that have you followed directions	No	b	1
Might I still give you full credit	If you like us	sd	1
Yes	What zero	sd	3
Zero is where it hits zero so it s below zero from here back it s not below zero from here till	greater than	sd	4
What if we made it instead of a strict inequality we made it something like  or	We could put brackets instead	sd	4
It wouldn t change these	It would change those over there	sd	4
It wouldn t change those because it can t hit the  so it would only change this one so that would change that because it does hit zero	the bracket and set them up	sd	4
Completely random irrelAbbynt wasting your time with these math problems	Can I take a photo	sd	1
If I asked you to solve this do you think you could	Yes	b	1
Yes	Maybe	sd	2
Maybe	We could	sd	2
You could	Yes	b	1
If I asked you to solve this do you think you could	Yes	b	1
If I ask you to graph this quadratic could you do that	Yes	b	1
Is that even in this unit	No	b	1
If I ask you to factor this quartic is that part of this unit	No	b	1

What would make that be zero		b	4
Is seventeen thirds equal to  8	No	b	1
Is 17 thirds going to make that  0	No	b	1
Do I need to actually plug that back in and show it	Yes	b	1
You ve still got to make sure that you train yourself to go back and check that because would that have been a problem	Yes	b	1
Okay so just watch	On the test say you  and you got that do you have to go back and check it repetitively	sd	1
What I would like you to do is just note that you checked it so say	Mental check	sd	4

This	I think they re due Monday	sd	1
I want to be answering questions and helping	Okay so were all  and I think you werent here the other day but the other guy that taught us how to do it	sd	4
This is just adding two rational expressions	Do I multiply this by all of this	sd	4
You need to get a common denominator	But doing  is there an easier way to do that	sd	3
If you just multiply this by this youre going to get a  in the denominator but what was the actual factor of it you see the  has	This one	sd	4
You already have that	I just need to do	sd	1
This is the only	That makes sense Most likely on these big ones	sd	4

Factor everything cancel out any common factors in the numerators and denominators	can never factor the ones that have	sd	4
can never factor the ones that have	theres also one over here	sd	2
theres also one over here	Do I cancel out the  this equation or would I cancel	sd	3
Any math questions	No	b	1
When you have youre wondering about this side	No the negative two	sd	3
Square this side were going to get one times one which is one and outside is going to be one times  so thats negative two you have one minus	Well yes I got that part and I ended up with	sd	4

All right	All right	aa	1
Okay	This doesnt work	sd	1
This doesnt work	Oh yeah it does	aa	1
two thirds what is it closer to	You mean three halves	sd	4
go	Oh so like a whole or a mix number	sd	3
Is it closer to two holes three holes	Okay	b	1
Okay	I get it now cuz I wrote the answer down and I was like inauidble	sd	4
I get it now cuz I wrote the answer down and I was like inauidble	So no halves right	aa	2
So no halves right	no and it should be like one and two three and four five and six	sd	2
no and it should be like one and two three and four five and six	Oh	b	1
Oh	Okay	b	1
Okay	So Like	sd	1
So Jackson Why is the first one between one and two	The reason why its between one and two is because the 10th um inaudible and then three inauidble and a half	sd	5
The reason why its between one and two is because the 10th um inaudible and then three inauidble and a half	inaudible	sd	1
between two and three	Well uh two times two is two times two is Four	sd	5
Well uh two times two is two times two is Four	And that takes away a whole so you have one and one half	sd	5
And that takes away a whole so you have one and one half	So since its one and half its more than one so its two	sd	5
So since its one and half its more than one so its two	Its in between two and three	sd	5
Whats the mix number of five halves	One and one half	sd	4
He had it but then he forgot the other one Explain to him why its two and one half	Because Because two can go into 5 twice so that would be 4 and then you would have a half extra	sd	5
Whats the denominator on it	Third	sd	4
Lets do one more set	Youre insane	sd	1

mixed number first	inauidble five and a half	sd	4
So what does it fall between	Five and inauidble	sd	4
Hold up mixed number first	I didnt really do the mixed number	sd	1
Its very easy	Im just guessing	sd	1
How many threes are in 17	inaudible	sd	1
Okay so what does it make it between	Five and six	sd	4
Michael what is the last one whole number or mixed number first please	Um it would be so the answer	sd	1

Did we use a benchmark	Yes	b	1
Now were going to go into the learning objective and the inaudible	Hello	sd	1
Hello	Haha	aa	1
So should I just have an answer on my board	No	b	1
there you go	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes	My marker ran out	sd	1
When you got an answer please stand up	Sorry	b	1
Sorry	Oh no no no	ba	1
sanitize my hands when youre gonna get hand sanitizer all over it	I dont know what to do	sd	3
If you were able to make a if you were actually able to at this moment in time just have the mixed number stand	I think I do	sd	1
Could you come and show us your board	Yup	aa	1
Explain what you did	Okay so for the number I got four and one fifth And so I did that because I put five boxes and I split them into fifths	sd	5
Okay so for the number I got four and one fifth And so I did that because I put five boxes and I split them into fifths	So there was one fifth two fifth	sd	5
So there was one fifth two fifth	I mean sorry	sd	1
I mean sorry	One hole two whole three whole	sd	5
One hole two whole three whole	and then one fifth	sd	5
So those of you that were struggling with the picture do you see what she did	Yup	aa	1
Did you draw a picture	Yeah	b	1
Did She showed us how she broke it apart	Yeah	b	2
Yeah	Yup	aa	2
Yup	No	b	2
No	No	b	2
why not	No because theres inaudible	sd	1
What are the number models not	Labeled	sd	4
Now were going to go into	math message	sd	1
math message	Or not math message	sd	1
Ava what did you say	I said so I said that the one tool is a	sd	4
first time either yes or no	Yes	b	1
And why	because one full is equals five fifths and then if you add 55ths to 165ths you get 21	sd	5
Okay or I can subtract	Thats what I did	sd	1
215ths and if I take a whole out of that what do I get	165ths	aa	4
165ths	One 165ths	sd	2
Im going to give you a few seconds to think about it	Using what	sd	1
To get the two wholes	I  subtracted inauidble	sd	1
I  subtracted inauidble	And then I got the eleven fifths and I just added inauidble and it was 21	sd	4
Pardon me	I didnt get to share	sd	1
Did you have the same thing they have	No	b	1
Okay answer what did you have	We put we didnt	sd	1
We put we didnt	He was answering the first problem	sd	1
He was answering the first problem	And so I was trying to tell him we were on a different problem	sd	1
What did you have Harmony	I got two and eleven fifths	sd	4
Because that is absolutely right	I got the same answer as her	sd	2
When I asked if you have the same answer you said no	Because she said no you couldnt put it into two	sd	5
Because she said no you couldnt put it into two	So I was	sd	1
Oh that is not what you had in the beginning	And she said no you couldnt put it into two because I got 2 and eleven fifths	sd	5
When it was your turn to share what did you share	I shared that I got 2 and 115ths	sd	4
So can I break it into three	Yes	b	1
Can I broke it into four	Yes	b	1
five times two is	Ten	sd	4
five times three is	Fifteen	sd	4
five times four is	Twenty	sd	4
Did you do it	Wait so we can do an improper right	sd	4
whatever you would like as long as the denominator is three	Do we just write the answer	sd	1
I would like you if it came down easy to you write It two different ways	Oh No	ba	1
Oh No	Two different ways	sd	1
Two different ways	I did 113rds	sd	4
I did 113rds	Wait can it be any mixed number or have to be with numerator	sd	3
I need to see	inauidble	sd	1
I just wanted to see that	I didnt get to a mixed number	sd	1
Go ahead	So I got so first I did 11 and 33rds	sd	4
How about 11 thirds	Oh sorry 113rds	sd	4
And howd you get 113rds	By putting all the wholes into a	sd	4
numerator	Numerator	sd	1
an improper	Mixed number	sd	4
No you took the mixed number and turned all the sholes into the improper fraction	Yeah	b	1
Okay	And then I got and then I put one of the wholes	sd	4
starts with an N	Numerator	sd	4
numerator	And I got 2 and 53rds	sd	4
Landon show us what you got	So I didnt get a mixed number	sd	1
Thats okay show us what you got the first time	was 113rds and what I did for that was I well this is easier for me to get the improper	sd	4
was 113rds and what I did for that was I well this is easier for me to get the improper	What I did is I did inauidble 3 whole times the three denominator and then I got nine and I did plus two	sd	5
You guys	Theres another one	sd	1
Whats one more	I know	aa	1
I know	One and 83rds	sd	4
I think	I think I can teach it	sd	1
I would like you to turn to page		b	1
ninety in your	I was so close	sd	1
Does that make sense	yeah	b	1
Now how many do I need to show this	inauidble three	sd	4
Color it in	11	b	4
inauidble Is 11 fourths the exact same as 2 and 34ths	Yes	b	1
Okay because if I do four times two what does that equal	inauidble	sd	1
Does that make better sense	Uh huh	b	1
What	I finish this page first right	sd	1
Yes	Okay	b	1
Okay	I dont get it when it says break inaudible	sd	3
So can that really be five halves	No	b	1
Because that is not	I got 114ths ofr my mixed number	sd	4
Okay so why did you not just put 11 fourths down there	Because it said break apart one to four fourths	sd	5
that wants you to draw a picture	Oh	b	1
Oh	So draw four squares and put 11s in them	sd	4
So draw four squares and put 11s in them	inauidble four fourths	sd	4
Did I just model that	Yes	b	1
Thats what its asking you	it is that the same thing is making a picture	sd	4
How many do I can I do that	I believe you can do wait find another name for fourteen thirds	sd	4
I believe you can do wait find another name for fourteen thirds	4 and two thirds	sd	4
Show me how you did that using thirds	Okay so what I did is I would draw three squares	sd	4
Okay so what I did is I would draw three squares	14	b	4
14	Wow	ba	1
break those into thirds for me	Okay	b	1
Okay now show me 14 thirds in those	Go right below or color them in	sd	3
Okay	Okay	b	1
How many is that	Thats a whole	sd	4
But how many total	Three	sd	4
Okay		b	4
do I have 14 yet	No	b	1
What do I have to do to get 14	Draw another circle	sd	4
draw another circle		b	4
Okay so now what is that	Thats a whole	sd	4
Or	three thirds	sd	4
So write three thirds	plus three thirds plus three thirds plus three thirds	sd	4
plus three thirds plus three thirds plus three thirds	And then plau three thirds and then a plus two thirds	sd	4
Okay so what is another name for that	four and 23rds	sd	4
Keep going	Okay	b	1
And it makes me sad	Am I supposed to do this	sd	1
Almost	Im confused on what to do	sd	3
Yeah how many wholes do I need to make it seven fifths	Um one	aa	4
is one and 75ths equal to four and two fifths	No	b	1
Did they take away a whole here and add it back in here	Yeah	b	1
So what would this whole now be	Three	sd	4
Okay so how many	inauidble	sd	1
How many times did they have to add that in	inauidble	sd	1
Okay so do three seven fifths	I put the wrong number in inauidble	sd	1
Yes	Are we supposed to do the bottom two	sd	1
Yeah you do the whole page	Two equals ten	sd	5
Two equals ten	because if they turned it	sd	5
Im breaking them into fourths what is wrong with me	That would mean that  taken away	sd	4
Okay so this would be	One and 7 halves	sd	4
does that make better sense	I think this one is right	sv	1
Oh and it was good	Yes	b	1
How many do I have left	inauidble	sd	1
And to get to nine I had to do How many	Two	sd	4
Cuz if it doesnt let me know	I get it	sd	1
Yes friends	I am confused onthis one	sd	3
Harmony are you doing okay or you need some help	Im done with that	sd	1
So keep doing the rest	Im confused	sd	3
What are you confused on	The next page	sd	3
Alyssa do you get the next page	Yeah	b	1
And five halves how many bananas does Mojo have	Oh I thought it meant five half bananas so like five bananas split in half	sd	4
So let me see something very quickly to make sure Im explaining this right	Can I help Ethan	sd	1
So how many bananas does he have	He has four and five halves	sd	4
DO they have the same	Yeah	b	1
So are you done with the first page	Yes	b	1
Okay Michael would you come meet with cannon please just to verify pages	Alyssa helped me but Im still a little confused	sd	3
We have four friends	So what Im doing is I have the three miles inauidble and I split into fourths because theres four friends	sd	5
Yeah	and then for the division of our model I distributed by inauidble to get three fourths I think	sd	5
and then for the division of our model I distributed by inauidble to get three fourths I think	So that would be the fraction right inauidble but you cant divide that	sd	5
It wont go in there but will 4 go into 30	Yes	b	1
How many times	Eight	sd	4
How about 7	Oh 7 sorry	b	1
So Seven	inauidble two	sd	4
This ones gonna run that one	You have 4 friends	sd	4
and these two friends this one each get a half then each of them is gonna get one	one and one fourth	sd	4
Amy come over here	It doesnt make sense to me	sd	3
So how many do I need to split these three miles into	one and nine fourths	sd	4
How many miles are they each going to run	1234	b	1
Okay	Wait wait so whats the numbers	sd	3
So if you finished all of page one and were truly working on the second page stand up	I only have  and 6 done	sd	1
Okay have a seat	I only did 3	sd	1
Landon Why didnt you get to it	Because we were waiting for you because we didnt understand it	sd	3
If you add 13  13 how much is that	Yes	aa	1
Were doing a whole class but thank you for checking	Youre welcome	sd	1
I want you to be listening for some key words that he says	I have the half because I know that  is 12 and then Ill get the third because the  its 13 each	sd	5
I have the half because I know that  is 12 and then Ill get the third because the  its 13 each	Then I found out that 1 13 would cover 12 and I know that 23 is not half	sd	5
Olivia	More than	sd	4
Can you explain what you did there	I know that the other side is 12 and then I said it cant fit because theyll go over the half and it wouldnt fit because we only have 12 left	sd	5
Youre on The Price Is Right up now	The Price Is Right	aa	1
Owen can you share what really you could do	If we got it or if the	sd	3
What do we have here	Half	sd	4
Well one daughter will Is it clear shes going to keep half	Yes	b	1
Sebastian	I thought it would be 15 and then we can get 16 because	sd	4
You said a 15 and 16	25 and 26	sd	4
How much is 26	13	b	4
What would I have to do	A common denominator	sd	4
Is 815 more or less than 12	More	aa	4
Ryan what are you thinking	What you could do then is do that	sd	5
What you could do then is do that	Then just split it fairly among the two other sisters	sd	5
Then just split it fairly among the two other sisters	Yes those	sd	5
What are these	Fourths	aa	4
How much	The other half	sd	4
Logan	The oldest daughter gets more than the two sisters	sd	4
I have your paper right here	I knew that the oldest daughter got 12 and the two younger daughters got  13 so I have both 12 right here	sd	5
I knew that the oldest daughter got 12 and the two younger daughters got  13 so I have both 12 right here	This was 1 12s right here	sd	5
This was 1 12s right here	Instead of dividing it by 3 right here I  and I knew that this was 12	sd	5
Instead of dividing it by 3 right here I  and I knew that this was 12	When I did these two right here and I knew that these two daughters could share this	sd	5
When I did these two right here and I knew that these two daughters could share this	I thought that they would get 16	sd	5
The other two would get 16	Yes	b	1
What color is the 16 piece	I think its blue	sv	4
Blue	Light blue	sd	4
Youre doing a little advice thinking here	No Im confused	sd	3
Youre confused	Yes	b	1
If she has 12 to share is there enough Were using too much land here	No because I wanted both of them here	sd	4
You want this	Yes	b	1
Does that anymore	Left over	sd	4
Well how much is left over	There would be 15	sd	4
Were almost done	Maybe instead of you doing Where did you	sd	1
Well does this work	No	b	1
Why not	Because this isnt	sd	1
Can you explain what you did	I tried a couple of different things  it will get 12 because turning your fraction into equivalent	sd	5
Did you get that somewhere	No	b	1
What denominator did you use	30	b	5
30	These turn to 5 and then these ones	sd	5
If I write them out like this what denominator did you use	I used 30	sd	4
What do you end up with	You get 6 x	sd	4
Mia can you share	When I first started out I thought that the oldest daughter will get 13 and the other two will get 18	sd	5
When I first started out I thought that the oldest daughter will get 13 and the other two will get 18	When we started to do the equation we found thats not	sd	5
What did we figure out	It was not 12	sd	4
What would 12 be	1224	b	4
Lucas did you write it down on your paper	Yes	b	1
What did you come up with	124  18  18  18	b	5
Whats 18  18	14	b	4
Models often	Help explain	sd	4
Jason you want to explain that one	So I got one because I know five eighths is one over is just just over a half	sd	5
So I got one because I know five eighths is one over is just just over a half	So it cant be a half	sd	5
So it cant be a half	Because then were adding because then were adding more to it	sd	5
Because then were adding because then were adding more to it	So be farther from the half and closer to the one	sd	5
George will you explain that one to me	You look at So to get two you need one more eighth	sd	5
What number are you talking about	So to get seven eighths to get one more eighth and seven eighths is larger than one sixth	sd	5
So to get seven eighths to get one more eighth and seven eighths is larger than one sixth	So you can make one more whole to get three	sd	5
Lets see Sophia why do you think its two	Five fifths is an improper fraction so I feel it is one and two thirds	sd	5
Anna	One and one third	sd	4
Joey	Three times two is six so 13 would be two sixths which is really close to a half	sd	5
Retell	Retell the problem in your own words	sd	1
Retell the problem in your own words	Figure out what you want to find	sd	1
Whats the first thing you do	You could probably read it in your own words	sd	4
What else	Get help	sd	4
From	The teacher	sd	4
Or	Your partner	sd	4
Anna	You can think about what you know about the problem	sd	4
Cooper	You can annotate the problem like whats important in the problem and what you need to do	sv	4
You want to get started	Read problem again	sd	1
Okay try to solve that with your partner	So she mixes one and a half	sd	4
So she mixes one and a half	So well like shes got one and a half and one and a half	sd	5
So well like shes got one and a half and one and a half	Thats three	aa	5
Thats three	Thats three	aa	4
Thats three	Three	sd	2
Three	One and one is two	sd	5
One and one is two	One half plus one half equals one	sd	5
Do you have another way	Yes what I did was I kind annotated the problem like what was important	sd	5
Yes what I did was I kind annotated the problem like what was important	You needed to have one half plus one half and they separated the fraction so I did one plus one equals two	sd	5
Anna	I drew a picture	sd	4
All right Sage what did you and Melody talk about	We talked about that when you multiply	sd	4
People arent being respectful listeners	When you multiply the mixed number	sd	4
The denominator	Yes	b	1
Times the whole number	Yes you get a common denominator then you add the numerator and you get an improper fraction	sd	5
Remember I said if there was nothing new that you learned you had to do that shortcut	I get it	sd	1
Yes	I had a question	sd	1
I had a question	I also learned that you know that we can do shortcuts then really know that we did like your point	sd	1
I also learned that you know that we can do shortcuts then really know that we did like your point	We are only worried if in the integer I dont know what that is	sd	3
That BrainPOP video still showed us the shortcut for how to rename mixed numbers right	Yes	b	1
Show one and onethird of the pizza	Is this	sd	4
Can I show you guys something real quick	Yes	b	1
Can I show you something	Yes	b	1
Thats pretty close to the middle right	Yes	b	1
As you work this is a team assignment today	Okay	b	1
Do we all know what collaboratively means	Yes	b	1
Yes	Were working together	sd	4
I always ask you to show your work right	Yes	b	1
I always ask you to show your work right	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
Juliana did you have a question	Do you finish the  first and go over one answer at a time	sd	1
You hear now Mr Sean	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thank you	aa	1
Everybody hearing that	Yes	b	1
Brian what is the first question wanting us to do	Wants to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers	sd	4
Good but which improper fraction do they want us to convert	385	b	4
Now you should be writing this in your journal	You do not have enough space on your paper unless you want to use the backside to do this	sd	1
Get to a sheet on your paper where you can do this	Should I get a new paper	sd	1
Should I get a new paper	I think you can	sv	1
Get a piece of paper	Now were going to use a piece of paper	sd	1
Its not my birthday but its Mrs Gonzalezs birthday so Im taking a break	Okay	b	1
Who thinks they can be a good Mr Gonzalez	Juliana	sd	1
Juliana	Me me me	sd	1
Me me me	Yes	b	1
Ms Evangeline	I dont think I was	sd	1
Your Mr Parker is	Ms Dani	sd	1
Ms Evangeline	Ms Evangeline	sd	1
Ms Evangeline	Ms Dani	sd	1
Ms Dani	Ms Evangeline	sd	1
You think you can handle it	No	b	1
Come on somebody be brave be bold	I can not do all three	sd	1
What do you think I would talk about first off	You will talk about how do you convert them to a mixed number	sd	4
What have I made the biggest deal about lately when dealing with fractions in general	Common denominator	sd	4
Youre about to lose your classroom dude	Hes going to get fired	sd	1
I would start this lesson by talking about what does our denominator tell us in this problem	Our denominator tells us	sd	1
Lets do this you talk Ill write	What does the denominator mean in this problem	sd	3
What does the denominator mean in this problem	What	ba	1
What	Pete	sd	1
Pete	Denominator is the main problem	sd	4
Denominator is the main problem	What	ba	1
What	Andre	sd	1
In this problem	In this problem the denominator is five so	sd	4
The board doesnt care Mr Parker	How many do we need to make what	sd	3
Repeat what you said	The five tells us how many pieces we need to make one	sd	4
What one	One whole	sd	4
One whole	One cow	sd	1
One cow	One whole	sd	4
When I taught yesterday what did I use as my wholes	Used marbles	sd	4
Used marbles	No	b	2
Who can tell our Mr Parker what I used as wholes yesterday	Candy bars	sd	4
Now that you know what were dealing with	So then its 385	sd	4
So then its 385	We need to find out how many pieces go We need to find out how many bags we have	sd	4
If were dealing with marbles and bags	How many bags we can make that are full	sd	4
Close	How many candy bars fit in the bag	sd	4
Can we use marbles and bags	Marbles	aa	4
We already know that theres 38marbles	How many enclosed in the bag	sd	4
If that improper fraction represented our marbles and how many marbles and how many marbles went in each bag what would our answer tell us	How many complete	sd	4
Juliana	It tells us how many bags we need to put all the marbles in	sd	4
Now ironically when we create a mixed number will they all necessarily be full bags	No	b	1
How would I go about solving this using the class	You would draw a picture	sd	4
First Id ask the class	What is the first thing we have to do	sd	3
What is the first thing we have to do	Camden	sd	1
Camden	Draw a picture	sd	4
Technically hes not wrong	You have to dray 38 circles and make groups of five	sd	4
You said I have to draw 38 circles	Yes	b	1
Yes	Draw 38 circles	sd	4
What would I say	We should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	sd	4
Thats what I would say	groups of 10 because since theres five to fill a bag each row should have	sd	5
And because 10 is a friendly number	So next	sd	1
So next	What do we do next	sd	3
Thats what I like to do	Milo	sd	1
Talk louder	Convert the proper fraction	sd	4
Call on somebody else	Jack	sd	1
Jack	You would sort the circles into bags	sd	4
How many go in each one	I think its 5 or 10	sv	4
Thea Can you clarify	Youre going to make group of five in each row	sd	4
Youre going to make group of five in each row	Because thats how many are going to fit in one bag	sd	4
Speak up	A whole	sd	4
What does our denominator Marie tell us in this problem	How much can fit into the bag	sd	4
How many poodles	How many	sd	1
Donkeys minivans spaceships	Marbles	aa	4
Keep going	Can fit in the bag	sd	4
Five marbles equals what	One whole	sd	4
Is that kind of important in this question	Yes	b	1
Okay Mr Parker keep going	Jacob what do you do now	qy	3
Now can you put numbers inside	Yes	b	1
Do you have to	No	b	1
If you think you can do an accurate count  you dont have to but if you think youre worried about your count make sure youre drawing numbers inside so count	One two three four five	sd	1
One two three four five	That will be seven	sd	4
That will be seven	You should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	sd	2
You should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	I already did it	sd	4
What would I do now Mr Gale	Count how much wholes you have	sd	4
Mr Gale what question do you think I would ask right now	How much circles are these	sd	3
Its how many	How much the wholes is	sd	3
How much the wholes is	There are seven wholes	sd	2
Seven whole what	How many do we have left	sd	3
Start talking louder	Camden	sd	1
Lets call on somebody who was paying attention please	Juliana	sd	1
Juliana	Theres three left  not enough to fill a whole bag	sd	4
Theres three left  not enough to fill a whole bag	Three what	sd	3
Three what	Three marbles they dont have enough to fill a whole bags	sd	4
Three marbles they dont have enough to fill a whole bags	Now whats the  the problem Thea	sd	3
Now whats the  the problem Thea	The total of the fraction what the fraction is	sd	4
The total of the fraction what the fraction is	The fraction is 7 35	sd	4
Angela	I forgot what I was going to say	sd	1
I forgot what I was going to say	Whats the mixed number	sd	4
Whats the mixed number	Whats the mixed number	sd	3
Whats the mixed number	7 35	b	4
7 35	The question should be asking for the fraction	sd	4
The question should be asking for the fraction	How did we get that	sd	3
How did we get that	How did we get the 35	sd	3
Do you need your Mr Parker to repeat the question	Repeat your question then	sd	1
Repeat your question then	Huh	b	1
Huh	Repeat your question	sd	1
Hes in the back of the room	How do we get that answer	sd	3
The question was how did we get the 35	We got the 35 because the remainder was 3 then theres a 5 so its going to be 35	sd	5
Why isnt it 7 338	Because its the numerator that change	sd	5
This class is just inspiring	Juliana	sd	1
Good thing I talk a lot	Because you need five to fill up one bag and theres three left so you dont have one full bag	sd	5
Five chicken to fill up the KFC bucket	Yes KFC	aa	1
Yes KFC	You left with a sack and you have three marbles leftover to fill up a sack but you dont have all the five and you need five have to fill up the sacks you got three out of five left	sd	5
Everybody agree with that	Yes	b	2
Does that help them understand why we do that	No	b	1
What would we call this method	Picture	aa	4
Picture	Picture	aa	2
Multiplication addition subtraction anything what is the benefit of doing multiple methods	You can get better at something	sd	4
You become more of an expert but theres an even more important reason	Why and how it works	sd	4
Why multiple methods works and why when you do partial products you should always check your answers with division	So that with multiple methods we can see if	sd	4
So that with multiple methods we can see if	we get the same answer	sd	4
What happens if we dont	We have to return our	sd	4
Now if you do multiple methods and you get the same answer what does that pretty much tell you	Its right	aa	4
Michelle	5x7	b	4
Very good and Ms Michelle what is 5x7	35	b	4
Then when we subtract Ryan what are we left with	Three	sd	4
Is three less than five	Yes	b	1
Lets do this since that marker clearly does not like	Well use another marker	sd	1
Every time we take away five of our marbles that equals one more of what	Sacks	b	4
Every time we take away one group of five marbles that equals one sack right	Yes	b	1
We would have 33 we take away one more sack were left with 28 23 18 13	Eight	sd	4
Eight	Then three	sd	4
How many sacks would that be	Seven	sd	4
Seven	Seven	sd	2
What do these three represent	Marbles	aa	4
We have 7 38 sacks of marbles	38	b	1
Any questions	No	b	1
No	No questions	sd	1
Question	Should we do the bottom as well	sd	1
Thats  the exact same thing because a decimal represents the separation of wholes and parts so when we say 7 35 our wholes are 7 and we are separating our parts	Which one are we doing	sd	1
Does anybody have any questions	I dont know how to  on subtractions	sd	3
Got it	Got it	sd	1
If I had two bags of marbles how many marbles do I have	I dont get it	sd	3
I dont get it	Th e	sd	1
Joshua	I drew vases	sd	1
Do you want to come draw	Yes	b	1
Okay come draw	And the I tried to have	sd	1
Okay so tell us a little bit about what you drew	This  represent how many flowers are there	sd	4
Did you guys have something similar	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	b	2
Yes	Yes	aa	2
Why Jaher	Because there is three vases and they want to know that we know that theres four and basically theyre saying how many flowers are in these all and we have to add  times four	sd	5
Could we have done four plus four plus four	Yes	b	1
Some of you might have had the equation of four plus four plus four plus four equals	12	b	4
Are both of those correct	Yes	b	1
Yes	16 plus 16 is	sd	4
Thats because I wrote too many fours	Yes	b	1
Thats better	Oh yes	b	1
Right	Yes	b	1
Everybody on the same page here	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	1
Can you put the mic when you read it	Sure	b	1
Sure	Which way is it	sd	1
Just hold it	Cut flowers will always stay fresh longer if 14 cup of soda is added to a vase full of water	sd	1
Cut flowers will always stay fresh longer if 14 cup of soda is added to a vase full of water	If a florist has three vases of flowers how much soda is needed to keep them fresh	sd	1
If a florist has three vases of flowers how much soda is needed to keep them fresh	Do you add soda to flowers	sd	1
Emma what do you think	Three fourths	sd	4
Think they do	We put 34	sd	4
Am I going to put into this vase	14	b	4
14	14	b	2
14	Oh	b	1
How much soda	14	b	4
am I going to put into this vase	14	b	4
How much in this one	14	b	4
Judith what did you write	14 plus 14	sd	4
Okay so Judith says we could do 14 plus 14 plus 14 equals	34	b	4
34	34	b	2
Could would write another way	Yes	b	1
Vivianna what do you think	We could do onefourth times three fourths	sd	4
Close really close	Three times onefourth	sd	4
Is that true as well	Yes	b	1
Is that true	Yes	b	1
Is this similar to what we did over here	Yes	b	1
Thats true for whole numbers as it is for fractions	Yes	b	1
Have you ever made your own ChapSticks	Yes I have	sd	1
Yes I have	No	b	1
We need four teaspoons of beeswax two teaspoons of shea butter three teaspoons of almond oil and oneeighth to one teaspoon of flavoring oil	Whats flavoring oil	sd	1
All the different flavors	Strawberry	sd	1
Three teaspoons for what	Batch	sd	4
Both of them need three teaspoons right	Yes they need	sd	1
Two groups of	Three	sd	4
How can we represent that using addition	Plus	sd	4
Three plus two	Three plus three	sd	4
How would we show that using a multiplication equation Aylec	Two times three	sd	4
When were multiplying does it matter what order we	No	b	1
put them in	No	b	1
Thats easy right	Yes	b	1
Im hoping you have a picture similar to what I have	Yes thats what Ive	sd	1
Oh	I have sticks	sd	1
Why do you have sticks	Im drawing lip balms	sd	1
Im drawing lip balms	squares look	sd	1
It is lip balm but we only made five batches	Yes	b	1
Yes	I made six	sd	4
Pass it off Everett	Because you put in cinnamon  18 of a teaspoon	sd	5
If I were to add to figure out my answer what would I have Marty	18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18 plus 18	sd	5
What did you get for an answer for that Marty	Fiveeighth	sd	4
You want to pass that	Yes	b	1
Okay pass it out	Ally	sd	1
Ally what did you get	I got 18 times 5	sd	4
Could I say 5 times 18	Yes	b	1
What answer would I get	58	b	4
Renata what do you think	Well we knew that	sd	1
Emmanuel	You have to make just take the 18 and try just add 5	sd	5
Okay say it again	If you have 5 just make 5 times 18 add 5 to the 18 youll have 58	sd	5
So now what do you think	That since the denominator is going to be the same were technically just multiplying 1 times 5 so you will get 58	sd	5
Did you hear what she said	No	b	1
So really when were looking at the addition all were doing is messing with our numerators right Ilik	Yes	b	1
So when were multiplying all we should mess with is our	Numerator	sd	4
Judith help us out what do you think	I think its 610	sv	4
Okay why do you think its 610	Because two times three is six	sd	5
Anybody	Yes	b	1
Following me	Yes	b	1
So this one Carter made four batches of marshmallow lip balm which sounds amazing and down here Julia made twenty four tubes of cherry lip balm	Thats a lot	sd	1
Do you see how multiplication is going to come in handy here	Yes	b	1
We dont have room to write that 24 times you agree	Thats fine	ba	1
Could we write that in multiplication	Yes	b	1
So youre going to finish this page then you have math passages I believe on the very next page is that accurate	Yes	b	1
So youre doing 225 and 226	Are we going to do 224 are we doing it again	sd	1
Who do you think is correct and why	I think Cat is correct because Dog the order of operation which is	sd	5
If I write this problem out what do I need to do first Isaac	4 x 2	sd	4
What mistake Carter did Dog make	He multiplied first	sd	4
We should multiply first we need to	Sorry he added first	sd	4
Im gonna tell you PEMDAS drives me a little bit crazy	Use GEMS	aa	4
Nate you grab the door please	Sure	b	1
When we look at this problem what is the first thing that we should do Mia	We should add 3  2	sd	4
We have a grouping symbol youre right what is 3  2	5	b	4
Okay what is my next step going to be Nate	Your next step for should be multiplication to division Youre going to have multiplication	sv	4
Whats my multiplication problem I have there	Your multiplication problem is multiplication problem is 5 x 6	sd	4
Whats 5 x 6	30	b	4
30	Oh I was looking at the blue	sd	1
All right then everybody whats our final answer	28	b	4
28	28 is final answer	sd	2
Who is correct	The cat again	sd	4
The cat again	The dogs not	sd	2
Blake do you know	I think the dog did 3  he did 3  2 or like no 6 x 2 and added a 3 and then no no no he did 32 and that equals 5 and then he did 6 x 5 and then I think he did forgot to do minus 2	sd	5
Kayden what happened	He did 3  2  5 and then he did 62 which equals 4	sd	5
He did 3  2  5 and then he did 62 which equals 4	Then he did 5 x 4  20	sd	5
Whats 10 x 10	100	b	4
Awesome 5 x 5 what does that mean	25	b	4
Awesome 4 x 4 what is that	16	b	4
Okay what does 3 to the 4th tell you to do Nick	What you would have to do is do 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3	sd	4
This number up here tells us to only do four of them	Oh yes	b	1
What is 3 to the 4th or 3 x 3 x 3 times 3	It means to do that number 3 x 3  9	sd	5
It means to do that number 3 x 3  9	Then you have to do 9 times 3 also	sd	5
What is 9 x 3 Lexy	9 x 3 Yes 27	b	5
27 x 3	Oh	b	1
Oh	And that is 89	sd	4
And that is 89	or is that 90	sd	4
or is that 90	81	b	4
Which one of those three numbers	81	b	4
Austin do you agree disagree or not	I agree	aa	2
What should we tackle first on this problem	First we should solve the exponent	sd	4
Something before that	Oh 6 plus 2	ba	4
Why do we do 6 plus 2 first	Its part of the grouping	sd	5
Naomi what do we do next	2 to the 3rd power	sd	4
Whats 2 to the 3rd power	8	b	4
Andrew what do I do next	8 you do times 2 which would be 8 times 2 which is 16	sd	5
8 you do times 2 which would be 8 times 2 which is 16	Then its 8 plus 18 minus 16	sd	5
Then its 8 plus 18 minus 16	Theres no more steps	sd	1
Should we do 8 plus 18 or 18 minus 16	8 plus 18	sd	4
Yes whats 8 plus 18	26	b	4
What is our final answer Ryan	Our final answer is 10	sd	4
Oh your brain just grew	I have as 2 times 3 and then I realized it was actually 2 times 2 times 2 to begin with 2 times 3	sd	5
Eli do you have something you like to add	I actually thought that the 6 plus 2 which is 8 times 2 was 2 to the 8	sd	5
I actually thought that the 6 plus 2 which is 8 times 2 was 2 to the 8	That was my mistake	sd	5
That was my mistake	Thats why I got 8	sd	5
We realized Chloe what was this right here	10	b	4
I think 10 is zero or 10 is always that right	Yes	b	1
Hold on guys I cant hear Paige	Come back to me	sd	1
Okay	I found the one that was difficult was 25 and 4	sd	3
25 and 4	Sorry I think its the LCM	sv	1
Which number is that over here	Number eight	b	1
Can you help me with this one Lexy	Yes	b	1
Whats the common factor of 25 and 4	This is what I just put it as the last one that I did	sd	4
This is what I just put it as the last one that I did	I didnt really figure it out	sd	1
What are the factors of four	Two and one	sd	4
Yes Nate	12 or 11 and 12	sd	4
Yes thats perfect	All right	aa	1
All right	Its fine	sd	1
Like this one and this one yes it will work and 12 pieces	Is that okay to do throughout math	sd	4
That works	Im just a little bit confused for the LCM of 12 and 8	sd	3
Im just a little bit confused for the LCM of 12 and 8	Well I just didnt get because it says the plus 24 because theres a plus on the right side	sd	3
I think thats just a different symbol	Okay	b	1
Do you want to go over that one of 12 and 8	Sure	b	1
Do six and four have any common factors	Yes	b	1
Whats six divided by two	No sorry	sd	1
No sorry	Three	sd	4
If we wanted to find our least common multiple we could do 8 x 3 or 12 x 2 either way its 24	Okay	b	1
Yes Rose	I wanted to go over 16 and 4 finding the least common factor	sd	3
It was that one over here	Yes	b	1
Yes	When I did it using the chart I started with two and I got eight and 12	sd	5
When I did it using the chart I started with two and I got eight and 12	Then I went to four and I got four and three	sd	5
Then I went to four and I got four and three	Here I got one and thats  I went to one and then get four and three	sd	5
Here I got one and thats  I went to one and then get four and three	Then for the common factor	sd	5
Can I stop you there for just a minute	Yes	b	1
Katie did you find it	Yes	b	1
Yes	Four goes into eight two times not four times	sd	5
It would be eight	My question was even though I already had eight on it and	sd	1
I bet the other one that went to eight when you had a mistake in it	Okay	b	1
What was yours	She can go	sd	1
Okay	Why does he	sd	1
I think its just a typo	Okay	b	1
Paige	I think it was what the GCF of 20 and 8 was	sd	4
I think it was what the GCF of 20 and 8 was	Oh no	ba	1
Martin for real last question	Okay	b	1
Okay	Well mine isnt actually a question	sd	1
Well mine isnt actually a question	Its just a thought	sd	1
Its just a thought	Three the answer had to be six I wonder what the numbers were because no other number could go through	sd	5
That could be	Its impossible to get it to unless it was three	sd	1
Yes Alan	I dont think the camera is following you anymore	sd	1
I think something is going funky today	now it just went down	sd	1
Well there are easier ways to remember this like saying Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally	Sally	aa	1
Sally	Oh yes thats what we use	ba	1
Yes Valerie	Well when theres parenthesis and  where do those fall	sd	3
Its on page six	Yes	b	1
What should I do first	You should	sd	1
What are we going to do next	Were going to do 3  8	sd	4
Whats 3  8	11	b	4
Now I would tell Nate just to be very careful that you know that you do addition and subtraction from left to right and multiplication and division from left to right as well	I think you do Im confused	sd	3
Do we have any grouping symbols	I dont think so	sd	1
Whats 2 x 2 guys	4	b	4
Whats 4 x 2	8	b	4
8 x 10 whats your final answer	80	b	4
What should I do first Nick	Do 106 because it is the first out of subtraction and addition	sd	5
What do I do first	First you would 6 plus 2 because	sd	4
What is 6  2	That would be 8	sd	4
That would be 8	It would be 10  8	sd	4
You have five minutes to do the next two problems to do four and five and if you finish early then skip over to nine	Nine or 10	sd	1
Nine or 10	You already given this one	sd	1
Yes	Can we do a partner	sd	1
For number four Elise what should I do first	You should do the multiplying 5 x 2	sd	4
Yes which is what	Which is 10	sd	4
Alan what do I do next	Next what you should do is divide	sd	4
Divide what	Six by three	sd	4
What do I do next Chloe	Then you do the 10 divided by 2	sd	4
When I look at this I see an addition problem first	lets say its five plus 10 and thats 15	sd	5
This one should have four plus 10	No	aa	1
Which is 15 minus 2 to finish us off please Rachel	The 15 one	sd	1
you have a question	Oh no I was just about the	sd	1
What should we do first	The first step is grouping and number five plus is five	sd	4
The first step is grouping and number five plus is five	Then it can be like	sd	1
Thank you very much what do we do next Bryce	We do 32 by five	sd	4
Reuben whats my final answer	50	b	4
What should I do first Maggie	Wait for steps	sd	4
Oh six	Yes six and seven	sd	4
All right go for it Paige	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	We start with the 10 plus three which is 13	sd	5
Its also on the board over there if you ever want to Do we have any grouping symbols	Yes	b	1
Do we have any exponents	Yes	b	1
Four to the second	Yes	b	1
Whats four to the second	Eight	aa	4
Not its not four times two its four times four	Oh then it would be 16	sd	4
All right Blake what am I going to do next	I dont really get the steps	sd	3
Do you see any multiplication or division	Yes	b	1
What do you see	Three times six	sd	4
Now all we have left is addition and subtraction Isaac what should I do first	You should do 10 minus 18 because this would go from left to right	sd	5
Miah what should I do next	Now you do 28 minus 16	sd	4
Which is	8	b	4
All right practice	I didnt	sd	1
I didnt	I didnt do it the way you did it and I got the wrong answer	sd	1
I didnt do it the way you did it and I got the wrong answer	Can I say how I did that	sd	1
I would rewrite it in right in using the correct steps here	Could you do it any other way like doing four to the second power later on	sd	4
I will do it in the order that we did it so that you do get the correct answer	Four to the second and then	sd	4
All right we have time to do one more together yes Mia	I didnt know eight 12	sd	3
What is 12 plus one	13	b	4
There we go	I knew it	sd	1
There we go	I got	sd	1
I got	I got it	sd	1
I got it	Wait I dont think we should just to and this is a lot more number seven	sd	4
Turn to your two by two partner	Bye guys see you later	sd	1
Bye guys see you later	Bye	aa	1
Youre good	I am okay	sd	1
Would you like to read the learning target	We are using the main strategy to add and to track to balance the main statement	sd	1
Do you have any answer of what balance means	Yes I was trying but someone was interrupting me	sd	1
Sorry I interrupted you	No why are you facing me	sd	1
What would go in the middle	Weight	b	4
Bruce what was one	Accounting up strategy	sd	4
What was the other one	US traditional subtraction	sd	4
Does that make sense	No	b	1
What was your balance		b	4
What was your strategy	I added 17 to 46 and then I added the dollar	sd	5
Did you do like place value	Yes	b	1
You started with the 146 then what	Then I added the dollars first then I added the cents which would be	sd	4
Were so glad youre here	You didnt name it	sd	1
What should we name it	Rob	sd	1
Rob	Chili Bob	b	1
What do you play	I play french horn and	sd	1
Yeah	I did choir last year	sd	1
Awesome so you know how to count music too	I did trombone last year	sd	1
Could you go	Yeah	b	1
Adriana did you play an instrument last year	I played the bass	sd	1
Thanks sweetie	I didnt turn on background	sd	1
Can you hear that in MathLand	No	b	1
Is that better	Yeah	b	1
It looks to me did you guys notice did we ever snap in class at the same time	I think we always did	sd	1
Adriana what would happen	Theyre never going to be on the same	sd	4
What do you think will happen	I think that theyll clap on every other third beat	sv	4
Why you think we will or why you think we wont	I think we will because I think they wont because if they clap on different beats every single time theyll never hit the same one	sd	5
Adelle what do you think	I think they wont	sv	4
to collide every 24th beat is that a GCF or is that an LCM or is that a common multiple or a common factor	I think a common factor	sd	4
I think a common factor	A common multiple actually	sd	4
Adriana what are you thinking	I think	sv	1
So did we ever have sound on the same beat	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
What do you notice about six and 12	Theyre even	sd	4
What is the signal to you that you have an LCM problem or a problem involving LCM	Maybe if you have two numbers that both	sd	4
Maybe if you have two numbers that both	When you multiply them by	sd	4
What are you thinking Alicia	Maybe when youre listing	sd	4
Are you listing factors or multiples	Multiples	aa	4
Yeah	LCM problem is to	sd	4
Is that better almost	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Adriana	I think	sv	1
Do you think this is a GCF problem or an LCM problem	LCM	aa	4
Adriana do you agree disagree or have a question for Brian	I agree	aa	2
Why do you agree that this is an LCM problem	Because you want to find a common multiple of six and eight	sd	5
Then I would say that would be an LCM problem	Then what would be a GCF problem	sd	3
When we would divide things up into groups	What would it say the problem	sd	3
Whats one thing we should keep track of in our table	Packs of cups	sd	4
Alicia whats another thing you think we should keep track of in our table	The cups sold after the day	sd	4
And then what else do you think	And plates	sd	4
I moved 30 times	Let me try that again	sd	1
Four would be how many	32	b	4
Five would be how many	40	b	4
So Alexa how many packages of cups does she need	Three	sd	4
Cole do you want to read it to us	Sure	b	1
Okay	And Collin	sd	1
Corey do you think GCF or LCM	I think its LCM	sv	4
Why you think this is LCM	I think its LCM because under it it says On the By one of the dots says least common multiple	sd	5
No these are just for us to circle what we think it is	Oh okay	b	1
Oh okay	Im not sure	sd	3
Youre like all over these today	I think itll be LCM because the	sd	4
Connor what would you like to add to what Alicia said	I couldnt really hear but I think its LCM because it says what is the first state the boys will have a game	sd	5
I couldnt really hear but I think its LCM because it says what is the first state the boys will have a game	And thats basically saying we have to go to play to find  on the same day	sd	5
Adelle do you want to read this one	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	During a performance	sd	1
Are you there Douglas	I am	sd	1
I am	Yes	b	1
Can you give us the gist of this problem	Yeah	b	1
Im just remembering that	Theyre trying to split it two groups of students equally amongst themselves into and they have to have equal	sd	4
Theyre trying to split it two groups of students equally amongst themselves into and they have to have equal	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Equal people in each group	sd	4
GCF or LCM	I think GCF	sv	4
Corey do you think GCF or LCM	I think LCM	sv	4
Alan C do you think GCF or LCM	LCM	aa	4
And Ashley what do you think GCF or LCM	Im not really sure but I think it might be LCM	sd	4
Or why did you think it was GCF	I think its GCF because	sv	4
Do you want to add anything for why you thought it was GCF	Sure	b	1
And why did you think this was LCM	I actually think its GCF now	sd	4
Oh tell us why	Because its saying they can only be part of one group so out of all the students	sd	5
Because its saying they can only be part of one group so out of all the students	So you have to find the greatest number so you can split them off equally	sd	5
Let me help you	Yes	b	1

Are we doing fractions right now	Thats a triangle	sd	4
Do we know division to clear up to 240	No	b	1
Do we know factor pairs for 24 when one of the factors is 8	Yes	b	1
If I know factor pairs for 24 which you do because you did a great job on your posters problem what is the other factor in the pair of factors for 8 and Ms Remy	30	b	4
If it were just 24 we would see a 3 but is it 24	No	b	1
Julian how do I know which one to put the zero on	You put the zero on the three because the eight does not have a zero	sd	5
How many zero zero over here	One only	sd	4
Tell me what basic fact I should be thinking of with this second facts triangle Asher	You should be	sv	1
Whats going on in your brain	Well you should be thinking about what times 4 equals 28	sv	4

Im not kidding in fact you have four problems to do	homework to	sd	1
Go ahead	Why is two right now	sd	3
Kayla what did you just get up and grab	A ruler	sd	4
Kayla	So that it would be straight	sd	4
Once youve plotted your coordinate grids you need to get a ruler	Isnt this a trick question	sd	1
I keep getting the same question and what is your question	I thought it was a trick question because it keeps on asking eight one to five one	sd	5
What do you think that tells us that we have to do	Go back to it	sd	4
Go back to it so you go to it once then when it reoccurs again in the order you connect the next plot point to it	Point	sd	1
Point	What	ba	3
What	How do you do it	qy	3
What did you just say	That means you have to close the shape	sd	4
Okay good job	So we connect it	sd	1
So we connect it	I dont understand where to start off	sd	3
You start off with the first one	I dont understand	sd	3
What one did you start with	We start on the edge	sd	4
That tells you right there which one to start with	You didnt say the facts	sd	1
Okay go ahead	What are we doing	sd	3
Youre plotting that on the original sailboat because our objective today is to take an image and apply a new rule to it every single time to change the shape of the image	So when I finish this do I fill this up	sd	1
No we havent done that yet	No	sd	1
I said only do this on the original	Im confused	sd	3
Are these all plotted	Yes	b	1
Where did everybody just jump up and get Clay	Am I supposed to connect the dots	sd	1
Are you done with yours	Yes	b	1

Please plot the coordinate 20	And 70	sd	4
Please connect coordinate 81 to coordinate 51	I still dont get it	sd	3
Is it when he connected his next plot	Yes	b	2
Is this connected the right way	No	b	1
Do you see how one missed coordinate changes your whole sailboat	Yes	b	1
Im looking around	Mines different	sd	2
Alexander this is yours from earlier answering my X coordinates	Thank you	aa	1
Roberto if I double eight and  what do I get		b	4
16 because eight plus eight is		b	4
Or 82 is		b	4
Do not worry	Its always forgotten	sd	1
If I double something Miriam if I double something what should my shape do	It should be bigger	sd	4
Could I get you to work with my two friends right over here to make sure that they understand this concept	Are we working with partners at our tables	sd	1
I would like you working with your shoulder partners	When it says zero	sd	1
Marco what question did you just ask	When you have to double to take off the zero do we keep zero or we stick to a one	sd	3
Who can help	It would be zero because if you do 01	sd	5
Anything times zero is always	Zero	sd	4
Remember when we attached those zeros	Yes	b	1
Yes	Adding doesnt do anything	sd	4
If we attach a zero it makes it bigger if we have a number in front of it but if were multiplying by zero 00 is	Zero	sd	4
Thank you	Bruce were working at the table	sd	1
Is that your	Yes	b	1
here	So Ill write six	sd	4
No right here	Okay	b	1
How are we doing	Good	ba	1
Good	Really good	sd	1
Good	40	b	4
40	40 good job	ba	2
Its important that you only do sailboat one okay	Okay	b	1
Yes once youve got it conn Zero again	Thank you	aa	1
Once you have finished sailboat one you may connect it when you are  and then we will move to the next one	Thank you	aa	1
Thank you	Were already done	sd	1
Do not draw this one until you call me over okay	We were going to plot it	sd	4
Exactly	Last time I erased this dot because I wasnt doing it with a ruler and then I forgot where the dot was and then I looked over I did it	sd	5
Is your partner ready to make a mistake	I think so	sv	1
Thank you	Now Im at 02	sd	4
Read this next rule to me please	Double the first number of the original	sd	1
So what are we doubling	Were doubling that first 40	sd	4
Were doubling that first 40	The one on the left	sd	4
What coordinate are we doubling	Eight	sd	4
What coordinate is that	The X	sd	4
What am I doing with the Y coordinate	Youre just leaving it the same	sd	4
Youre just leaving it the same	Youre leaving it as a zero	sd	2
Okay mark those or do those	So youre doubling this one or this one	sd	3
So youre doubling this one or this one	162	b	4
Original pair	Okay	b	1
That says original so youre always going back to the original	Then itll all be the same because if we double this thatll be that same number	sd	5
Yes but are you doing anything to this one	No	b	1
See	Okay	b	1
Whats going to happen to my boat do you think	Its going to become longer	sd	4
Are you ready	Im not ready because I still have to do this	sd	1
No I want you to plot this	Okay	b	1
I want you to plot this	Okay	b	1
Okay well you have to wait till your partner is done because Im not sure why youre done and your partner is not	We started at the same time	sd	1
Okay read this rule to me	Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	sd	1
What is that called	The X coordinate	sd	4
What am I doing with the Y coordinate	Leaving it the same	sd	4
What do you think is going to happen to my boat now	Its going to become wide	sd	4
Are you ready	Yes	b	1
Okay very good	These ones	sd	1
Read the second	Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	sd	1
What coordinate am I doubling	The eight	sd	4
What coordinate is that	The	sd	1
You remember you told me	16 is it	sd	4
No is the	X	b	4
X coordinate and what coordinate is not changing	The one	sd	4
Am I right	Yes	b	1
Yes	I dont know	sd	1
Nice job Stella now you may graph that one	Can we also connect to that	sd	1
Okay Bruce read this rule to me	Rule double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	sd	1
What coordinate am I doubling	Youre doubling this one this one and this one	sd	4
What coordinate is that	The X so now Im going to Y	sd	4
What coordinate is the eight	Eight is X	sd	4
What coordinate is not	X	b	4
No what did she just say	The Y	sd	4
What are we doing with the X coordinate	Were doubling that	sd	4
What are we doing with the Y coordinate	The Y coordinate will just be here	sd	4
What are we doing with this one	Were doubling the first number and leaving the original number the second number the same	sd	4
What coordinate are we doubling	The X	sd	4
All right are you ready ladies and gents	Yes	b	1
Okay read this one to me	Double the second number of the original pair leave the first number the same	sd	1
What coordinate are we doubling	The Y	sd	4
What are we doing with the X	We leave it the same	sd	4
What about the original	That too	sv	1
Are you ready	I dont know if I did it correctly	sd	1
One two three four five six seven eight nine	162 is right there	aa	4
Connect 162 to 102	So 102 is right there	aa	4
Now youre going to connect 102 to 1014	1014 is right there	aa	4
You dont have 1014	I do	sd	4
Connect this one to that one	24 is right there	aa	4
24 you had it I apologize darling	Its okay	sd	1
Okay now connect 24 to 102	102 is right there	aa	4
Heres 10 where is 2	Right there	aa	4
Zoey make sure that you connect from the dot or its not going to be the right kind of line	Okay	b	1
What coordinate always goes first Chloe	X	b	4
Now go from 102 to 02	02 is down there	sd	4
Where is 02 Penny	Right there	aa	4
Why is there not a dot on it	I got a little bit stubborn	sd	1
Now go 40 to 140	So right here basically	sd	4
What are we doing	Doubling like this	sd	4
What coordinate is that	Coordinate X	sd	4
Okay and what am I doing with the Y coordinates	Youre just leaving it	sd	4
Thank you	Do we do this the rest of this	sd	1
Bam bara bam bam	Bam bam	sd	1
Okay listen up	What am I supposed to do	sd	3
Bam bara bam bam	Bam bam	sd	1
Did we use a coordinate grid to plot points to form pictures	Yes	b	1
Did we actually apply rules	Yes	b	1
Now our success criteria was I know Ive  After applying the rules did that image become modified	Yes	b	1
Yes because it got	Bigger taller	sd	4
Taller	Wider	sd	4
Wider and	Smaller	sd	4
Okay do you all believe number from one to five I got this Mrs Mr Strathom	I got this	sd	1
Mrs Mr Strathom I got this	I got this	sd	1
I will  are here and say Goodbye see you	Goodbye see you	aa	1
Okay so can you guys see	Yes	b	1
Youre comparing	Yes	b	1
You have about another minute and a half	Okay	b	1
4 times 50		b	4
30 times 7		b	4
70 times 8		b	4
		b	2
20 times 40		b	4
Why not 80	Because 80 wouldnt work because theres 2 zeros added	sd	5
70 times 40		b	4
9 times 30		b	4
60 times 800	804 80000 48000	b	4
Matt why not	Because there is 4 zeros	sd	5
600 times 40		b	4
		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
900 times 9		b	4
		b	2
I hear 81 000 Whos correct		b	4
Why is it not 81000	Because there is only 2 zeros	sd	5
So if I write product for my basic fact David how many zeros should I add to the end of that		b	4
		b	2
Yes		b	4
It was following a pattern and then it messed you up didnt it	Yes	b	1
Weve been working on multiplication all unit long so whats different about this	Were doing a twodigit number times a twodigit number	sd	4
Thats so interesting that it has	Its page 130	sd	1
Lets get the right page up	Yes	b	1
Its thinking	Think think think	sv	1
Well have to use the book	Okay	b	1
Can you talk us through what you did	I Jesse the  three up there and then multiply 3 times 2 equals 6	sd	5
I Jesse the  three up there and then multiply 3 times 2 equals 6	Then add 2 zeros and multiply 4 times 2 equals 12 8	sd	5
Im glad you saw that and we didnt have to correct you	4 times 2 equals 8	sd	5
4 times 2 equals 8	600 so I need to multiply 600 plus 80 equals 680	sd	5
Jesse	Well Im not in disagreement but	sd	2
What did you do differently	Well I think she got 600 for 20 times 30 but I didnt get that	sd	2
Did you forget to add 2 zeros	Yes	b	1
Put your book right on top of mine and well be able to see what youre doing	I did 2 times 3 and added the zeros so I got 600	sd	5
I did 2 times 3 and added the zeros so I got 600	I got 600 because of the 2 zeros	sd	5
I got 600 because of the 2 zeros	Then I did 2 times 4 and then I added a zero and got 80	sd	5
Then I did 2 times 4 and then I added a zero and got 80	Then put plus 80	sd	5
Then put plus 80	606	b	5
606	088	b	5
088	000	b	5
Dakota do you have a different answer or did you just do the process differently	I did the process differently	sd	2
It takes a lot of courage to go up there	I wrote down 30 plus 20times 20	sd	4
Times 20 thank you	then I put 30 times 20 equals 600	sd	5
then I put 30 times 20 equals 600	Then I added 4 times 20 equals 80 and then I got 680	sd	5
So you did it right underneath the way that they kind of modeled for us	Yes	b	1
Any disagreements on how Matt or Dakota solved their problem	No	b	2
Is that marker not working	Three times seven that equals 21	sd	5
Three times seven that equals 21	Then I added a zero because theres a zero to three and I added three times eight equals 24	sd	5
Then I added a zero because theres a zero to three and I added three times eight equals 24	Then I added two zeros	sd	5
Did you really	Yes	b	1
What did she do as she was working through the second time Jocelyn	When she did 30 times 80 she forgot to add another zero	sd	2
But as she was working it did she actually do it right the first time	Yes	b	1
2400 is not very close to 240 is it	No	b	1
Joel thank you	Me and David did the same thing just	sd	2
Then when I walked by it was like	Can we show what we did	sd	1
there you go	So David	sd	1
So David	Before Joel corrected me I wrote 240 right here because I thought 30 times 80 was 240 and then Joel told me that I had to add two extra zeros and the I got 2610	sd	5
2610 is very different than 500something isnt	Before we did that David	sd	1
Before we did that David	When we put the extra zero to 240 he thought it was going be 405  but then he realized that it needed this	sd	5
See thats the problem when you dont have your numbers in columns there you go	So we did zero zero zero	sd	4
up for me a little bit there you go	426  we got 2610	sd	5
Clayton	Its twodigit numbers with no zeros	sd	4
17 isnt a multiple of 10 is it	No	b	1
The 3 in 34 is worth what		b	4
30 the 4 in 34 is worth what		b	4

Do you agree with Katie that three dark blues could be the whole	Yes	b	2
Stephan what other number would you like us to do together	Number three	sd	1
Number three	All right	aa	1
Stephan read that	If one light blue is twothirds what is the whole	sd	1
Alice talk to me what are you thinking	Youll take one light blue piece and take a different color like the light purple and then place it on top and see if thats half of it	sd	5
what I hear you say	Yes	b	1
Nate what did you hear Alice say	That twothirds is equivalent to one of those	sd	4
If this is twothird how she going to figure out what to do How do you know what one of the thirds is if thats two then put them together into one piece	I said that you take the one light blue and then you take one light purple and its half of it then you might find out that thats onethird and so twothirds	sd	5
Okay can you now repeat what she said	Yes so one blue is equivalent to two purples	sd	4
Sophie what two pieces did you use to fill your one light blue	I used two light greens	sd	4
If it were a full circle what now	Onethird	aa	4
Have a question about	I agree	aa	2
What is your light blue worth	Twothirds	sd	4
Why is it that Alice says this is worth onethird	Because it is half of twothirds and you have to use one so it will be onethird	sd	5
Okay so I hear you saying that one of these is half of the twothirds and say what you said then	Since its half of that since its half of twothirds  one	sd	5
Because twothirds plus onethird equals how much	Threethirds	sd	4
Luke which one did you find	Yellow	sd	4
Its a yellow everyone take your yellow piece out lay it on top of those two is that the same size	Yes	b	1
Partner up figure it out help each other out I want to hear your answers in 15 minutes	Good how are you	ba	1
If you have two of these its equal to that so one what	One half	sd	4
Nope	One two	sd	4
Pam pam param pam	Pam pam	sd	1
Pam pam param pam	Pam pam	sd	1
Two of them if I put two of them together what color does that equal	Pink one pink	sd	4
If this is 25 Maddox what did you do to figure out what 55 would be	We need 25  the half of 25 so what should be 15	sd	3
Avery	Purple	sd	4
Whats the whole thing		b	4
What is the whole shape	One pink	sd	4
One pink	One yellow	sd	2
One yellow	You did the wrong half I thought it was yellow	sd	2
Luke	The blue	sd	4
The lightblue	Three blues on two yellows	sd	4
Well do I have anything thats that shape	No	b	1
Do I have one pink and one light blue	Yes	b	1
Please dont freak out about this is no something youre going to have to do very often because do we all carry fraction circles in our pockets	No	b	1
And we want 34 of it to be in white leather and the other 14 in a different color leather	Red	sd	1
How did you do it	So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them	sd	5
So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them	We put two of the dark blue ones and then one purple	sd	5
If you had to name that fraction that would be hard to do wouldnt it	Yeah	b	1
Okay so our  for today is  will you read that for us please	Yeah	b	1
Whats a fraction	A fraction is like three fourths or one half	sd	4
What makes those fractions different than a mixed number Cooper	Well a mixed number is kind of like  two or four halves or something	sd	4
Well a mixed number is kind of like  two or four halves or something	Then that would be the fraction and the mixed number would be	sd	4
So you gave me example and youre absolutely right but tell me in words how would you describe the difference	So the difference is a fraction is basically a number over a number and a mixed number is always at least one who number	sd	4
So theres a whole number in a mixed number	And a fraction	sd	4
No because why Anna	Because theyre not the same	sd	5
Because they what	Because theyre not the same sized pieces	sd	5
Joey	Theyre different denominators	sd	4
So your success criteria today Landon is	I will know Im successful when I use  of fractions circle pieces to solve problems two point	sd	1
Two through five	Two through five on page 164	sd	1
Isaac	Theyre both mixed numbers	sd	4
How else	The denominators are the same	sd	4
Landon	So on number one you just have to subtract the numbers	sd	4
So on number one you just have to subtract the numbers	Theres no  need to do	sd	4
So then tell me about this one	So the	sd	1
So the	The three is bigger than the one on the bottom number but the one third is smaller than twothirds	sd	5
The three is bigger than the one on the bottom number but the one third is smaller than twothirds	So what I did  three and carried a one over to the one third you make it four thirds	sd	5
So what I did  three and carried a one over to the one third you make it four thirds	Then I could subtract two thirds from four thirds to get two thirds again	sd	5
How would you  do an estimate Anna	You just use	sd	1
What would you think	Three fourths is  whole	sd	4
Uhhuh	And one third is  to zero	sd	4
Uhhuh	one minus zero equals one	sd	5
So for problem for Joey what would you do	I think I would multiply the denominators together to see what the common denominator is	sd	4
So number four we have three fourths minus one third	Yes	b	1
quick denominator  to find that	Three times four	sd	4
Three times four equals		b	4
Were going to multiply three fourths by what	Three thirds	sd	4
We get nine twelfths and here were going to multiply one third by what	Four fourths	sd	4
So what would the answer to that one be Logan	The answer to that one  five twelfths	sd	4
What denominator would be used	I would probably use	sd	1
I would probably use	I would probably take a whole from	sd	4
So what do you need to do first in order to have Get this ready to subtract	four fourths	sd	4
A whole from three and youd make this into	Four thirds	sd	4
Can you subtract four thirds from a half	Yeah	b	1
What do we need to do with the fractions in order to subtract this Aiden	What you should do is we should do three times two  denominators to equal six	sd	5
So then what	You multiply the one by	sd	4
The one half Logan	What you got to do to make the half into a sixth is you got to multiply three times three over three	sd	5
Are we good	Okay	b	1
So can we subtract it now	Yes because theyre common denominators	sd	5
Do you know what the next step is	You get rid of one of the threes	sd	4
Okay	Then you add it over to the denominator	sd	4
quick common denominator Anna	quick common denominator  five times three	sd	4
Youve heard this before	Weve done this before	sd	1
Ferogio what can you tell me	So if you make a square for like a question problem  and it says the area model so outskirts of the perimeter are like  if it was like five inches and then the top is like two inches or three or four	sd	5
Which part is the area which part is the perimeter	Well the  parameter is like the outside and the area is in the inside	sd	4
Well the  parameter is like the outside and the area is in the inside	Just like how were doing that solve the mystery case of the shrink ray gun	sd	2
We want to know the inside area	That might be a lot of money	sd	1
And you know what he told me	What	ba	1
Youre putting in a tree	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	You should change your floors into	sv	1
You should change your floors into	My great grandma died yesterday sadly	sd	1
Samantha you think you have an idea	Yeah	b	1
What do you think	You multiply the base and the height	sd	4
Ethan how do we find the perimeter	You have to add the length of all the sides	sd	4
This was a reminder for us right	Yeah	b	1
Okay give me 15 jumping jacks because I think youre still sleeping you might have eaten too many  this weekend	I didnt eat	sd	1
I didnt eat	I did	sd	1
I did	I ate too many	sd	1
I ate too many	How many	sd	1
William did you already do your jumping jacks	Yes	b	1
You did what	Three times seven	sd	4
Samantha	Seven	sd	4
What did you say	He said you need to  I think	sd	1
He said you need to  I think	No he probably said oh you need help on your hand or something like that	sd	1
No he probably said oh you need help on your hand or something like that	Thats exactly what I just said	sd	1
Okay	I forgot about it	sd	1
Three plus three	That would equal 20 because three  plus three equals six and seven plus seven equals 14	sd	5
I did seven plus three is 10 seven plus three is 10	Oh 20	b	4
So our perimeter equals what		b	4
20	20 square inches	sd	4
All right lets turn it over make sure youre totally awake and then were going to get to some challenging things	Now I remember now thank you Ms Smith	sd	1
How does that ABxH and PBBHH how does that help us out	Okay	b	1
All right  Ready	Almost just need one more minute	sd	1
Olivia okay are you done with the area	Yes	b	1
What did you do	I did 10 times four because I know that those are both the  four inches and its like kind of the main character of	sd	5
Okay our base and our height right	Yes	b	1
And what did you get for your final answer	I got 40 because 10 times  10 times four equals 40	sd	5
40	Inches	sd	4
Inches	Yes	b	1
Did anybody else match	Centimeters	sd	4
Centimeters squared	I was about to say	sd	1
Now oh three and three	Oh four and four	sd	4
How did you finish this out	So I added  28	sd	4
So you got 20 here and your got this here and then you got a total of 28	Centimeters	sd	2
Show me on thumbs how do we feel about our area and perimeter refresher	I guess	sd	1
All right all right  all right	What	ba	1
What	Oh shes giving us one of those problems where you have to guess the area	sd	1
Oh shes giving us one of those problems where you have to guess the area	Oh yes	b	1
So heres what you know	I know the answer	sd	1
Do we know the height	Yes five	sd	4
So thats definitely not my best place to start	Youre missing half the	sd	4
I know	Five times  six equals 30	sd	5
Five times  six equals 30	Sorry	b	1
What	Multiplication first	sd	4
How did you solve this	What I did I started counting by five to get to 30 and I found six	sd	5
Okay	And so I did five times six equals 30 and then for	sd	5
And so I did five times six equals 30 and then for	I did five plus five plus five	sd	5
Yeah Olivia helped you out with that part	Ive been knowing that	sd	1
What did you do for our perimeter William	I did  seven because I got the  and put it  on top of the mystery	sd	5
Right	Five times seven equals 35	sd	5
I have a  six six five and a five		b	4
What is it		b	4
Did I figure it all out	I have a different way to find that base	sd	1
Okay what did you do	So you can use the area divide the area by the height	sd	4
Okay lets try one more	One more	sd	1
Did I give you an area	No	b	1
Did you check in with Emily	Think about it	sd	1
Think about it	The bottom is 50	sd	4
The bottom is 50	And the question mark on the side what is it	sd	3
And the question mark on the side what is it	What makes 35	sd	3
What makes 35	By multiplication	sd	3
You should have written it down so it should be on your paper	You did a problem last question we did a problem about five times what equals	sd	4
in their time of need	So what do you think five times seven is	sv	3
Avery what do you think	figure out how to  equals 350	sd	4
Why do you think that this is our starting point	Oh because to be able to figure out the perimeter and to figure out the height of the box	sd	5
Hes absolutely correct	Perimeter is 50 inches  inches is the area  so if you do some very very simple problem like multiplication  if you can divide	sd	5
You took the area formula and you replaced what you knew	I originally just  in my head and I figured out the  height	sd	4
I originally just  in my head and I figured out the  height		b	4
Okay you said 70	70 times 50	sd	4
Yeah	Seven times five is 35	sd	5
Uhhuh	So you make a	sd	1
How many zeros do you have over here	That would be 3500	sd	4
Let me talk to Avery	No it should be seven	sd	4
And then if we make some mistakes we can easily go back and see what we did	I know what to do	sd	1
You know what to do	Yes	b	1
Walk us through perimeter	So for perimeter I did 50 plus 50 and then after that 70 plus 70	sd	5
Jump off	Seven	sd	4
Ferogio made the same mistake you did	Yeah same	b	1
Notice that their visual model is what	Two cups split in half	sd	4
Did you talk about dividing fractions yesterday	Yes	b	1
Andy whats a strategy you can use to divide the fractions	You could draw a picture to represent the whole	sd	4
You could draw a picture	You could draw a picture	sd	1
Then show	Different parts of it	sd	4
Paul will you add to that	to find the answer and then shade that in	sd	4
Okay	You can add one	sd	4
Explain how you would use a number line	If you have two people  it will be two parts and youre sharing three cookies youll have to split each section into three parts and show many cookies each person gets	sd	5
Okay so were basically doing the same thing we did yesterday were just making sure were using visuals	I need a new whiteboard please	sd	1
You wouldnt write it like that would you	No	b	1
Were going to erase these I just gave you that as a visual okay	Okay	b	1
Can you reach them babe	Yes Im done	sd	1
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
Roberto Im going to have you because you disagreed with Gabby so Im going to have you because you had a thumbs down am I correct	No	b	1
Who had a thumbs down	I had a thumbs down	sd	1
Okay go ahead	Other times when Ive multiplied its turned out less than the fraction that I multiplied the whole number by so I immediately saw it and I didnt even have to multiply it	sd	5
Other times when Ive multiplied its turned out less than the fraction that I multiplied the whole number by so I immediately saw it and I didnt even have to multiply it	I just immediately thought that it would be less than because normally when we multiply a whole number to a fraction its less than the fraction	sd	5
Go ahead explain your thinking	I knew that we can add the denominator well one of the denominator and  the other one and then 8 x 1 is still 8 and then 7 x 3 is 21 and thats bigger than 78	sd	5
If I do this the way that my friends with the thumbs up said what is 7 x 3		b	4
And 8 right	You can break it down to	sd	4
To what	Ill break it down into twelfths	sd	4
Ill break it down into twelfths	Not twelfths	sd	2
What is 8 x 3 everybody		b	4
Do I automatically now know by looking at this that its less than	Yes	b	1
Its less than 3	Yes	b	1
Go ahead	May I explain	sd	1
Please do because Im explaining this and I showed how its less than three this way but you explain what you did	May I draw it	sd	1
Im very sad we dont get to go see the kindergarten play	Yes	b	1
Go ahead	Normally in my head I would think of so its a whole so I will think of 78 x 33	sd	4
Explain that to me	Because there are three wholes and so the denominator is three	sd	5
Okay	So 7 x 3  21 and 8 x 3 is 24 so its around a  I dont know if it is 78 or its equivalent to it or if its bigger I would have to do the math	sd	5
Go over and explain the way you did it	I basically did the same exact thing as Kaylas	sd	2
I basically did the same exact thing as Kaylas	I did 7 x 3 is 21 and then 8	sd	5
Because it does come out if I put it as a whole as 258	Actually even more as the denominator is one	sd	4
Because you always put it over one	Because its a whole	sd	5
There was your misconception	Normally I thought that would be three wholes but now I realize that thats a one whole	sd	4
My hands are old	Oily	sd	1
Thumbs behind your whiteboards	Can I have more time	sd	1
Was your thumb up or down	My thumb was down	sd	4
What did you think it was	I thought it was up	sd	4
Explain why you thought it was down go over to the board if you need to	I thought it was less than because of 23 you multiply the denominator by the denominator which is 24 and then the numerator by the numerator which is 14 and 1424 is less than 78	sd	5
What is 1424 closer to	12	b	4
12	12	b	2
Friends with your thumbs that were down or up does this make sense	Yes	b	1
Thats what I was going after	Its only two friends that shes sharing it with	sd	4
Thank you	Is it okay if I come up and talk to you	sd	1
No I haveFranc and IsaGabby coming up	Are we going to do these the two and	sd	1
Are you done	Yes	b	1
First of all explain what the question was asking you	The question was asking	sd	1
Big voice	The question was asking how many pieces	sd	4
Do the bread	do the bread	sd	1
Okay goahead	For one I think  knew that the 14 there was two of them and then 18 so I did 14	sd	4
Would it be 14 x 8 14   8 or 8   14	Eight	sd	4
Why 8   14 and you can call on someone if youre not sure why 8   14 versus 14   8	Because then youd have a negative number	sd	5
Andy you want to add	Because if you used 14   8 you have to divide 14  into eight pieces	sd	5
Nicole	What if you do 2   14	qy	4
Why would I do 2 14	Because you only have two pita breads	sd	5
You get the way she worked with multiplication to make it work	Yes	b	1
If our learning objective is to divide and if I know I need to be able to justify what the difference in these two things are am I gonna work on division	Yes	b	1
You did this yesterday	No	b	1
No	No what do you mean	qy	3
You might have done one similar	Yes	b	1
Thats the first mistake you did	I cant find the marker	sd	1
Did you tell people to look in their desks	If I had it it will help	sd	1
Im not sure why were flinging dry erase markers anyway	Yes Im ready	sd	1
Guess what Im going to let you call for help if youre not able to do it	Okay	b	1
Then if youre justifying your thinking can we help where you might have had a misconception	Yes	b	1
All right so show us what you did	I did half a yard each so half of a yard is 12	sd	5
I did half a yard each so half of a yard is 12	It asks how much halves he has	sd	5
How many halves	I got nine halves because 1  1  2 and then I did 12  12 equals a whole and so I added them together I think 3 6 and 19	sd	5
What did you do Donte	I made a number line and then I know I had  so I put it up to three and I did halves and that three	sd	5
Elinor I would like you to explain it the way you did it	What I did was I made three strings and I split them in half and I counted each half and thats one two three four five six and then I have 63	sd	5
63 or 62	62	b	4
Thank you	I just put three yards long because its three yards on there	sd	5
Roge tell us what you did	What I did is I knew that therell be three divided by those halves so I made a square and then I split it to 12 and then I split into 12 and then I split into 13	sd	5
What I did is I knew that therell be three divided by those halves so I made a square and then I split it to 12 and then I split into 12 and then I split into 13	I forward then 12 because its 12 and its closer to 1	sd	5
I forward then 12 because its 12 and its closer to 1	Then I circled the one of the 16 because 26 doesnt count so itll be 16 and not 32	sd	5
He said there were 62 yards	Okay	b	1
Go	Hes correct because in	sd	2
Can you look at Roges no leave your chalk there can you look at Roges and tell Roge where his misunderstanding was	I think his misunderstanding is when	sd	1
What was his misunderstanding	That it shouldnt be thirds because its a whole	sd	2
What sweetie	Because he shaded in the half but he didnt shade in the thirds of the three	sd	2
He didnt divide it did he	No	b	2
If he wouldnt have shaded anything in what would you have come up with	I dont know	sd	1
If you didnt shade in those three how many pieces would you have had	About three pieces	sd	4
No youre not listening	Six pieces	aa	4
It didnt ask you to multiply anything it asked you to divide it	I didnt multiply	sd	4
Its when you shaded that you confused yourself	Thank you	aa	1
All right so makes sense	Yes	b	1
Asher you understand what you were doing	Yes	b	1
Heres what you couldve done that would have made this easier because you knew that you had three yards right	Yes	b	1
Makes sense	Yes	b	1
Does everybody have a partner	Yes	b	1
All right	How many	sd	1
My first number model is going to be what	You divide it by 12	sd	4
What	I was thinking that it could just	sd	1
10 divided by 12 then which has to be	Okay	b	4
Got them Theo	Yes	b	1
Theo what do I need to do with those boxes	We need to	sd	1
Theo how many 12 pound boxes of nuts can I make out of those 10 boxes		b	4
What is the number model that Im writing	No I just did my own	sd	1
No I just did my own	No	b	1
No	I think we only have 10 boxes	sd	4
Now if I do 20 x 12 what do I get		b	4
How is 40 30 half of 20	is 10	aa	4
If I have 20 and Im cutting it in half what do I get	I just realized because now it isnt	sd	1
I just realized because now it isnt		b	4
How would you check that Maggie	There are	sd	1
Okay	I dont know how	sd	3
Let me see your answers	She then cuts these six meters of yarn she wants to cut the yarn into further little pieces to make new pieces which youre going to go to use	sd	5
She then cuts these six meters of yarn she wants to cut the yarn into further little pieces to make new pieces which youre going to go to use	You have six meters now how many 13	sd	5
Now to check it Im going to multiply K X 13 to equal 6	Okay Alexa lets go over it okay Dorsey had six meters of yarn she wanted to cut the yarn	sd	1
Okay Alexa lets go over it okay Dorsey had six meters of yarn she wanted to cut the yarn	18 pieces	sd	1
18 pieces	Alexa	b	1
Do I raise the second picture please	Do you need to put that six	sv	4
Please make sure people are not looking at what youre doing	Okay Alexa whats this	ba	3
Do it simply that way	Do you know this one	sv	2
Do you know this one	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	Do you like Minecraft	sd	1
Do you like Minecraft	No	b	1
No	It says	sd	1
It says	Minecraft is pretty boring	sd	1
Minecraft is pretty boring	You can actually	sd	1
Gwen your cover is open	Its actually	sd	1
Its actually	Its fun though	sd	1
Momentarily I will waiting for everyone to get done	Number two is	sd	3
Number two is	We did it	sd	1
Okay show me your models hold them up show them to me	Its mine	sd	1
Its mine	Youre just respecting the fact is when youre on call with me	sd	1
What is my summary model	One two three four	sd	1
There you go who	Numbered to 18	sd	4
Okay	No six	sd	4
You dont get it yet so I cannot let you go with your partners yet	For picture well draw five circles split them on the boards	sd	4
For picture well draw five circles split them on the boards	Its 20 for us	sd	4
Its 20 for us	Because youre five pulled	sd	4
Okay Roberto had five		b	4
	He split	sd	4
Im sorry	Into 14	sd	4
Into 14	So then	sd	1
So then	How much	sd	1
We are saying	Because he does them into 14	sd	4
Because he does them into 14	How many1 14s are in three	sd	3
How many1 14s are in three	Thats subtraction	ba	4
Thats subtraction	Its the 5 divided by 14	sd	1
Its the 5 divided by 14	Because	sd	1
Friends you are absolutely right	See one two three four five	sd	1
Its fraction whole number topic so fraction	I tried	sd	1
It doesnt say whole number	one of the 14s	sd	4
one of the 14s	No she didnt	sd	2
All right Gabby factor pairs for for Gabby what do you know	Okay so the factor pairs before are one times four equals four and two times two equals four	sd	5
All right Gabby are there any other factor pairs for four	No	b	1
Janessa can you help me out with the factor parents for five	Miss Cornish Did you call my name for this	sd	1
Is this Janessa	No but the first pick before Janessa	sd	1
Nope	No Okay	b	1
Alright Janessa tell me about the factor pairs for five	5	b	1
What was it	One times five	sd	4
What did you say	One times five	sd	4
Janessa are there any other ways I can multiply to get five	Yeah	b	1
What is it	Is two times five	sd	4
How much is two times five equal		b	4
So is that a factor prayer for five	No	aa	1
I dont know if you said something	I dont think so	sd	4
Rachel tell me what is the other or what are other factor pairs for 10	One times 10	sd	4
pull a stick Angela tell me about the factor pairs for 11	one times 11 for sure	sd	4
Angela Are there any more factor pairs for 11	I dont think so	sd	4
Well youre right now could I double check each number to make sure	Yes	aa	1
Harper can you help me out	One times five I mean 15	sd	4
Any others Harper	No	b	1
Lauren can you unmute And can you tell me the one that you typed in the chat	Three times five	sd	4
Okay Gabby what is the pattern	That goes one factor two factors one factor two factors one factor two factors	sd	4
Are you saying that the two the five and the 11 they only have one factor pair	Yes	b	1
What have you and your group talk about	We talk about that maybe prime means only one factor and compose means they have multiple	sd	4
Okay so Dianat you say that Prime So by looking at my prime numbers on the board of five and 11 you said they only have one factor	Yes	aa	1
thats true	Yes	aa	1
But what do they have one of its that vocabulary word that I just erased on the board	They have one Multiple	sd	4
Kurt what do you think	factor pair	sd	4
What are those two factors	I think I know what the two factors are	sd	1
Can anyone hear me	Hey yeah I can hear you	sd	1
Okay so Gabby tell me what they are	Can you repeat the question first	sd	1
What are the factors that prime numbers have only	one and itself	sd	4
Exactly	When composite numbers have one and a double or more	sd	4
You can just unmute and tell me		b	4
Anyone else have another one		b	4
What was it		b	4
17	I Noticed something	sd	1
I Noticed something	Its only the odd numbers that are prime numbers	sd	4
What about 2		b	4
What is a composite number	A lot of even numbers	sd	4
Yeah so can we just say more than two factors	Yes	b	1
Can anyone else think of another composite number		b	4
Absolutely	I can think of A composite number	sd	1
So again	I can think of a composite number	sd	1
Okay tell me		b	4
	It has way more than just one factor	sd	4
Are there any other factor pairs for 25	I feel like theres another one but I cant think of it	sd	4
class	Yes	b	1
it is	No	b	1
No	Yes it is	sd	2
Can I count by twos to get to 25	Because the end number an odd number	sd	5
So AJ are there any more factors of 25	No	b	1
If you need more time to write this down	T	b	1
Yes	I already did the priming composite number slides because I knew what they were	sd	1
I did not hear what you said	I did not submit it past the due date	sd	1
All right	Okay	b	1
So now that we know what prime and composite numbers are how	T	b	1
Yes	I cant find this slide	sd	1
What kind of number has exactly two factors one in itself	Can you repeat that again	sd	1
A number that has exactly two factors one and itself is called a blank number	composter I think	sd	4
Missy Im still talking to you	Im reading	sd	1
I will wait for you to find the answer	It is inaudible	sd	1
Yes or no	I have the notes from the Practice	sd	1
So Angela what is a number that has exactly two factors one of them itself	The second question or the first one	sd	1
The second question the one that weve talked been talking about now for four minutes	A prime Number	sd	4
to determine if a number is prime or composite list all of its What Jacob	factors	sd	4
oops sorry	I tried to take a Peaceful one minute break so I can go say hi to my dad but Isaiha started screaming at me so Im just like goodbye	sd	1

Read me the problem Anderson	Multiply 735x231	sd	1
Can we use our math monster for this	Yes	b	1
Should we use our math monster for this	Yes	b	1
Do we have to draw the monster every time	No	b	1
Harriette tell me the next step	The ear	sd	4
Yes what does that look like	3x39	b	5
Harriette	Because if we combine threes three times three six nine	sd	5
Where did you get those numbers 3x3	From the digits of 735x231	sd	4
Wallace and Walter tell me what Harriette just said	She said that 3x39 so then you would have nine problems	sd	5
Okay where did she get those three and three	From 735x231	sd	2
What about them now because they have a three	Because it has three digits	sd	5
Apollo	The horns	sd	4
Right tell me about them	730 and five	sd	4
730 and five	Then the next one is 230 and one	sd	4
Apollo call in someone else to give me the next step	Harriette	sd	1
Harriette	Then you multiply the new numbers like 700x200 and then its going to be 700x30 then 700x1	sd	5
Then you multiply the new numbers like 700x200 and then its going to be 700x30 then 700x1	Then after that you move on to the tens place from 735 on the one with the tens to the hundreds place from 231	sd	5
Then after that you move on to the tens place from 735 on the one with the tens to the hundreds place from 231	Then 30x30 and then 30x200 and then 30x30 and then 30x1 and then 5x200 5x30 5x1	sd	5
Harriette call someone else to do the next step	Juliet	sd	1
Juliet	Then you start multiplying that and then 700  you take the four zeros and you move them to the answer	sd	5
Then you start multiplying that and then 700  you take the four zeros and you move them to the answer	Then times 314 and then you take the three zeros of the next one you move them to the answer	sd	5
Then times 314 and then you take the three zeros of the next one you move them to the answer	Then 3x7 is 21 and then 700x1 is 700	sd	5
Then 3x7 is 21 and then 700x1 is 700	Then you take the three zeros and you multiply 2x3 and then you take the three zeros and move it to the answer	sd	5
Then you take the three zeros and you multiply 2x3 and then you take the three zeros and move it to the answer	Then you take the two zeros and move it to the answer	sd	5
Then you take the two zeros and move it to the answer	3x3 is 9 and then 30x1 is 30 and then 5x200 you take the two zeros and put them in the answer	sd	5
3x3 is 9 and then 30x1 is 30 and then 5x200 you take the two zeros and put them in the answer	Then 5x2 is 10 and then 5x30 you take the zeros and move it to the answer	sd	5
Then 5x2 is 10 and then 5x30 you take the zeros and move it to the answer	Then 5x3 is 15 and then 5x1 is 5	sd	5
Juliet call on someone else to do the next step	Wayne	aa	1
Wayne	We add all of the answers together	sd	4
Ivanaone thing	You check if you have nine problems first then you add	sd	4
All right Wayne next step	Then we add all the	sd	4
Thank you	Then 1000	sd	4
Can I draw my lines on this one	Yes	b	1
Did you guys see me get confused for a second	Yes	b	1
To make sure theres one every	Column	sd	4
All right Wayne do you want to continue this one or call on someone else	Column 000000005 is 5 and then 000000305 is 8 and then 00709 is 1601 is 17	sd	5
Column 000000005 is 5 and then 000000305 is 8 and then 00709 is 1601 is 17	Then it goes in the next column and then 101 26 is 81 is 9	sd	5
Then it goes in the next column and then 101 26 is 81 is 9	42 is 6 and then 10 is 1	sd	5

In one table there could be two different conversations happening right Wayne	Yes	b	1
Now say Wade and Charlie they really both think they have the right answer could they ask the other team on their table	Yes	b	1
Sounds good	Yes	b	1
Thinking about it	I cant see it	sd	1
Anderson what is that fraction		b	4
What	That one	sd	1
This one	110	b	4
Now if we look at our place value chart remember that we added a couple of new place values a couple of weeks ago	Yes	b	1
So if I say 110 where am I going put my one	In the 10	sd	4
All right put an answer down in five four three two one showdown	Ms Ms Cornish I have a question	sd	1
Whats the question	Does that count	sd	4
Say one more time	Ill do that	sd	1
Okay did you guys hear what he said	Yes	b	1

Yes	No Im not ready	sd	1
Read it	2100	b	4
Apollo read it for me	2100	b	4
Apollo where am I going to put my two	Youre going to put your two on the back and then you add the zero first and then point zero then two	sd	5
You said put the zero in what place value	In the hundredths	sd	4
Jane read this fraction for me	9100	b	4
In what place value	Tenths	sd	4
Read it to me one more time	9100	b	4
So which place value is it going to go in tenths or hundredths	Hundredths	sd	4
Hundredths yes so my nine goes here and then Jane what else goes in my blank	Zero	sd	4
A period but in math it is a	Decimal	sd	4
A good connection	Or and and	sd	1
Whos going to try it	This one	sd	1
You may uncap your marker and you may write your answer on your paper	20100	b	4
Apollo read me this fraction	80100	b	4
Dakota what is this fraction	80100	b	4
Dana read me this fraction	80100	b	4
that the same thing as 80100	No	b	1
What place value would it be in	In the hundredths	sd	4
Thats it its in the hundredths now	In the tenths	sd	4
He said lets put the eight in the 10th place and then Winston what am I going to put in the hundredths	The one	sd	4
The one where in the one	The eight	sd	4
Eight too	The zero	sd	4
Ivana and Wallace	0 80	b	4

You guys have 2 14	Yes	b	1
So this	Yes	b	1
I ate two whole pizzas and then how much of a third one	14	b	4
I dont see a picture on your paper	2 14	b	4
If I come in and I say Oh my gosh it hurts so bad how much pizza did I eat Dakota	24	b	4
Do you guys agree with me that this shows 2 14	Yes	b	1
Do they have pieces in them yet	No	b	1
How do I know how many pieces are in this pizza	I dont know	sd	1
Ivana how do I know that there are four pieces in these two pizzas	Because theres already 14 and that means four	sd	5
Does my denominator tell me how many pieces there are in all	Yes	b	1
This whole pizza what fraction of the pizza that I eat Harriette	14	b	4
No 14 would be one of these pizzas but I ate all of them	One whole	sd	4
One whole or Ernie	44	b	4
Ivana	44	b	4
JJ	14	b	4
Dana help me out one of these pieces how much am I eating	14	b	4
All right what about this one if I ate both of those	24	b	4
What about this one	34	b	4
34	14	b	2
14	54	b	2
54	64 74 84	b	4
64 74 84	94	b	4
94	Whoa you ate a lot of pizza miss	sd	1
Are you guys ready to learn their special names	Yes	b	1
All right so on your paper what I need you to have written is I need to have all of this written on your paper	I dont have space for this Im going to have to write to a different source	sd	1
Im just going to keep how many pieces I ate and then over here Im going to show that is out of how many	I dont know how to write that weird one	sd	3
Thanks Wallace and Wade Darby	Me	b	1
Im going to give you about 10 more seconds to finish up	Do you put equal on both	sd	4
I want you to say that mixed number	Mixed number	sd	1
If its written on my board its written on your paper	I knew he wouldnt write it thats why I told him he couldnt do it	sd	1
So then if I look at 94 is 94 a mixed number	No	b	1
Helen	Because it doesnt have a whole number	sd	5
Dakotaa	The bottom	sd	4
The bottom	The bottom	sd	2
The bottom is bigger than the top in this number	No the top	sd	4
Improper	Improper	sd	1
An improper fraction is when the top number is what bigger or smaller	Smaller	sd	2
Melody	Because the top number it goes more bigger than the pieces that its actually supposed to be	sd	5
Six so do I eat I whole pizza	No	b	1
No	Yes	b	2
Okay so improper fraction always greater than what	One whole	sd	4
All right everybody have this written down	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
Let me give you 20 more seconds	Thats weird	ba	1
Today were going to focusing on what	Adding mixed numbers	sd	4
Were going to be adding numbers that have both fractions and what	Decimals	sd	4
Read this along with me	The cafeteria has 2 35 tubs of grape jelly and 1 15 tubs of strawberry jelly set aside for breakfast how many tubs of jelly were there in all	sd	1
The cafeteria has 2 35 tubs of grape jelly and 1 15 tubs of strawberry jelly set aside for breakfast how many tubs of jelly were there in all	Okay so how would I figure this out	sd	1
Dakota why did you say were going to add all the numbers up	Because I read it in how much tubs of jelly were there in all	sd	5
Because I read it in how much tubs of jelly were there in all	In all means were going to add	sd	5
So the cafeteria had how many tubs of grape jelly	2 35	b	4
2 35	One jelly	sd	4
One jelly	One jelly	sd	4
We had 2 35 tubs of what kind of jelly	Grape	sd	4
If you dont have this written down yet write it down on your paper	On any piece of paper	sd	1
I have one whole tub of jelly because thats my whole number and then how much of another one	One fifth	sd	4
How many whole tubs of jelly do I have in my picture	Three	sd	4
Count them with me	15 25 35 45	b	1
What are my whole numbers in these two Dakotaa	The whole numbers are four and six	sd	4
No whole numbers	Three	sd	4
What are my whole numbers Anderson	Two and one	sd	4
Now do you guys know what two plus one is	Yes	b	1
What is two plus one	Three	sd	4
If Im taking out my fractions and adding them up what am I going to add up	Numerators	sd	4
Just the numerators so in 3515 Winston do my denominators change	No	b	1
No and what is 31	Three	sd	2
Three	I mean four	sd	4
Great	You didnt know what you were doing	sd	1
Follow along with your finger point the name of the person who this is about	Where are we at	sd	1
What are we going to add	2 14 and 1 24	sd	4
Abni will you walk me through what you did	First I did  the whole numbers	sd	4
Okay so you took out the whole numbers two and one and you said 21	Then I did equals three and then I did 31	sd	5
Why three plus one	Because I took the product and added it with the one came up to one four and then I got four	sd	5
Wait hold on can I add my whole numbers to my fractions	No	b	1
Thats like saying that Im going to add two cats to two dogs	That wont end right	sd	4
Now those are done what do I have left to add Abni	One plus two which is the two fractions	sd	4
So 14 plus what	14 then you add 123	sd	4
14 then you add 123	I want to scratch it off with my pencil	sd	1
The side noises need to stop	3 34 because those are the two products	sd	5
One two and then Dakotaa how much of another one do I have	14	b	4
Two what	Two on the other end	sd	4
Yes so that fraction is	24	b	4
How many wholes do I have	One two three	sd	1
Then how many fourths do I have	14 24 34	b	1
Did we get the same answer as we did before	Yes	b	1
If youd like to work with me in the back table you may	Were not worried about mass	sd	4
Think about whether it matches your background and what you know about subtracting fractions or subtraction in general	I dont understand	sd	3
I dont understand	Wait can you solve it	sd	1
Tell me why you think this is my favorite mistake that I saw in the exit tickets	Ms	sd	1
Ms	Do we even have to solve the whole thing to find it	sd	1
Do we even have to solve the whole thing to find it	I already found it	sd	1
I already found it	I found it	sd	1
Yes you might not need to solve the whole problem to find my mistake	I already found it	sd	1
I already found it	Someone stole my marker a minute ago	sd	1
Did you try that one	No	b	1
I think some of your classmates are still looking for the mistake so can we give them another	This one dont work	sd	1
This one dont work	Lets go	sd	1
Ellis	This one	sd	1
Paula	A mistake that you made is when you were subtracting 8 and 18 24 subtracting 5 and 24	sd	4
A mistake that you made is when you were subtracting 8 and 18 24 subtracting 5 and 24	You cannot subtract 18 from 20	sd	4
Someone at Maggies table	You cant subtract 20 from 18	sd	4
Miguel	Then youre going to get	sd	1
Were not going to go there right now but	You cant do that in fractions can you	sd	4
Why do you think that so many kids rhere were probably five kids showed this work on their exit ticket	They just werent thinking about it at the time	sd	4
Jeremiah why do you think so many kids showed that work on their exit ticket	Because they werent doing the work they were just doing what they know from normal subtraction which is 18  20 is 2	sd	5
What did these students need to do Gabby	They need  8 into a 7 and then 18  24 which is 42	sd	2
Tell me what I need to do next	You have to add 24 to 18 which you would get 42	sd	5
Now you just told me that 24  18 equals what	42	b	4
Now do I have enough to subtract	Yes	b	1
This is 2 and	2224	b	4
Whats another way of saying that Lindsay	2 and 1112	sd	4
Did we talk about reducing or simplifying in 4th grade	Yes like the  class we would get  if we didnt simplify or we were supposed to simplify	sd	4
Yes like the  class we would get  if we didnt simplify or we were supposed to simplify	I dont remember doing that	sd	1
Do you know what it means to simplify or reduce a fraction	Reduce a fraction I might know	sd	1
Tell me what that means	I know youre doing this earlier on TTM and I got most of your  correct	sd	1
Do you know what it means to reduce or simplify a fraction	Kind of like this like if the numerator on this was 12 then this would be 6	sd	5
Feel free to talk to classmates at your table spot partners as youre drawing your picture	I already  figured it out	sd	1
Tell me how you figured it out already	Because 13 of 24 is 8 and then 23 is 16 because 3 x 8 is 24	sd	5
Ms Rossi I heard someone say Im doing this on TTM right now so you might have peers that have background knowledge about these kinds of problems	Do we have to draw a picture though	sd	1
Thats one way that mathematicians communicate	I dont know	sd	1
Mr McCourt did what	He bought a case	sd	1
How much juice was there	13	b	4
Lindsay where did you start	I started out by making 24 boxes of juice 24 boxes in the case	sd	4
Did you boxes look It looks like it It kind of looks like a grid like this	Yes	b	1
Then I see youve got four columns and six rows	Yes	b	1
Did you find that using addition helped you solve the problem	Yes	b	1
Did you use anything other than adding fractions to help you though	Not really	sd	1
Yes	What I did was I just found out what 13 of 24 is and then what 23 of 24 is and I got 8 and 16	sd	5
You found out what 13 of 24 and what 23 of 24 is	That adds up to 24	sd	4
You found when you were just working with numbers	I think that theres 16 boxes of one flavor and then 8 of the other	sd	4
Lindsay or  tell me a little bit more about what you did next with the pictures	Then I split in into 6 so 16 26 36 46 56 66 and I know that 26 is equal to 13 so I know that those would be grapes which meant there are 8 grapes	sd	5
Then I split in into 6 so 16 26 36 46 56 66 and I know that 26 is equal to 13 so I know that those would be grapes which meant there are 8 grapes	Then I know that 46 is 23 so I covered the rest of those and got 16 cranberries	sd	5
Then I know that 46 is 23 so I covered the rest of those and got 16 cranberries	4 8 12 16 yes	b	5
I want to hear from someone else who used a picture to solve the problem but maybe their picture looked a little different from Lindsays	I kind of had a picture but I just basic I mostly had arrows	sd	4
Maggie tell me what you did	I put them in  and I found out that 38 equals 24	sd	5
I put them in  and I found out that 38 equals 24	I put 8 right here because that needs to be equal to 13 and 16 here because 8  8  16	sd	5
Yes	She drew the fraction and then the 8 and 16	sd	2
What does she know about 8 and 16 as they relate to 24	Very little	sd	1
I would argue she knows a lot because she got the problem right and she modeled it in a way that we can understand	Maybe she knows that 8 x 2 is 16	sd	2
Maybe she knows that 8 x 2 is 16	Since 13 x 2 is 23 8 x 2 would equal Would 16 be equal to 23 because its the same as 13 and 18 just times 2	sd	5
Paula	7	b	4
Rachel	35	b	4
what do you think	Five fives	sd	4
Tell me why you think that	Because if you skip count by fives you can reach 35	sd	5
Who can add on to that because I know if I skip count by sevens I can also get to 35	Because 5 x 7 is 35	sd	5
I just want to hear why you think so	You should cut it into fives because it says what is 35 of 35	sd	5
Go ahead and cut your bar into five equalish pieces	I have an answer	sd	1
What is each one of these worth	7	b	4
Agree or disagree	Agree	sd	2
Grant why do you agree	Because 7 x 5 if it equals 35 then we can easily do 3 x 7	sd	5
Did we solve the problem	No	b	1
No	Not fully	sd	1
Why not yet	Because you dont have You didnt write on the board what 35 of 35 is	sd	5
I didnt write on the board what 35	You havent counted to 35	sd	4
You havent counted to 35	You need to put	sd	1
You need to put	skip counting by sevens in the column in the rows underneath so 7 14 21 28 35	sd	5
Im going to draw what Maggie did because its kind of cool	You still need to find an answer	sd	2
How many of those five parts do we need to put together	Three	sd	4
No what is 35 of 35	21	b	4
Eileen whats your question	Its not really a question	sd	1
Its not really a question	Its another way that you could solve it	sd	1
Tell me another way I could solve it	Another way you could solve it is figuring out that 7 x 5  35 or doing 355 which equals 7	sv	5
Another way you could solve it is figuring out that 7 x 5  35 or doing 355 which equals 7	Then you can do 7 x 3 which would equal 21	sd	5

Turn and tell a thought partner at your table what do you already know about this problem	No I disagree for I think it does  12 by 12	sd	2
No I disagree for I think it does  12 by 12	24  18	b	4
Am I missing a remote	6	b	4
6	6 yes	b	2
What do you know about this problem Paula	I know that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	sd	4
Paula say it nice and loud and proud	I said that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	sd	4
I said that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	She said I said one dozen equals 12 and two dozen is 24	sd	2
I dont have any right now so get a pencil for it	Split into fourths because 6 x 4  4	sd	5
Show me what your tape diagram looks like	I mean 6  4  24	sd	5
I mean 6  4  24	and 12  12 is 24 so that means that 12 roses are white and the other 12 roses are red	sd	5
I know this	I respectfully disagree with her because were doing fourths not halves and its 34 of red roses	sd	2
I respectfully disagree with her because were doing fourths not halves and its 34 of red roses	Were trying to figure out what 14 is equal to	sd	4
What do you notice about what  diagram	Its in fourths	sd	4
Ms Rossi All right talk to me about tape diagrams	I figured it out	sd	1
I figured it out	4 is a multiple of 24 right	sd	4
4 is a multiple of 24 right	We want to know how many since 34 roses are red so	sd	4
Lets see if it matches	24 so	sd	4
How many of the roses were red	How many white roses are there	sd	3
34	Yes	b	1
Yes	How many are red	sd	3
How can you find how many are white	It looks like I got it right	sd	1
It looks like I got it right	I dont know red or white	sd	1
I dont know red or white	16 red	sd	4
The rest how many are left	Think outside the box	sd	1
Paula will you come up and draw your tape diagram	It is fair	sd	1
It looks like you used a different strategy	Its an easier strategy	sd	1
Its an easier strategy	I can share the easier strategy with the class	sd	1
Whats the same about them	Theres 13 and theres 12	sd	5
Theres 13 and theres 12	Its the exact same like 6 6	sd	5
Its the exact same like 6 6	That equals 24 and then	sd	5
All right if you dont	tape	sd	1
Eileens going to tell us what she sees in Paulas tape diagram	What I see in Paulas tape diagram is that she figured out that she should split the diagram into fourths	sd	2
Jeremiah whyd she split it into fourths	Because 24 is equal to 4 because it goes up like 4 8 12 then 16 then	sd	5
Rachel	Because 34 on the bottom the denominator is four	sd	4
All right Eileen tell us more about what Paula did	Since its split into four she divided 24 by 4 and noticed that it was 6 for the answer	sd	2
Since its split into four she divided 24 by 4 and noticed that it was 6 for the answer	244 which would equal 244 which equals 6 so she put 6 in each box so she knows that each fourth equals 6	sd	2
244 which would equal 244 which equals 6 so she put 6 in each box so she knows that each fourth equals 6	Underneath each box she put Underneath the first box she put 6 and since 6 x 2  12 she put that underneath the second one and since 6 x 3  18 she put that underneath the third box and she put 24 underneath the last box because that is the whole number	sd	2
How could you use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer Eileen	You could use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer because since we know 34 of the roses are red we could use the third box the third number underneath the third box to help us figure out that 34 of the roses are red	sd	2
You could use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer because since we know 34 of the roses are red we could use the third box the third number underneath the third box to help us figure out that 34 of the roses are red	We could use 18 since its underneath the third box as a representation that 18 is 34 of the roses	sd	5
What did the question want you to find out	It wants you to find out	sd	1
6	6 which is also equal to 14	sd	4

Division	Multiplication	aa	4
Whats something that you could draw strategy that weve learned just today	Tape diagram	sd	4
If youre stuck and this is a little bit confusing this problem what could you do	I	b	1
All right Maggie I see you drew your tape diagram and you split it into how many parts	Three	sd	4
Whyd you split it into three	Because three is the denominator	sd	5
Ms Rossi Rachels feeling ready	Yes	b	1
I see youve started your tape diagram	I dont know which one like what I can actually	sd	1
Whats the whole	I have to do fractions and decimals	sd	4
I have to do fractions and decimals	These two are probably going to be more easier	sd	1
I hear you saying that because 17 is an odd number youre thinking youll have to use a fraction or a decimal	equals 32	sd	4
Go ahead and draw your tape diagram for	This is complicated	sd	1
John can you show Chris what a tape diagram is what it looks like	Basically imagine theres an imaginary 21	sd	4
Basically imagine theres an imaginary 21	I think its	sv	1
Draw your tape diagram	5 12 right guys	b	4
Theyve got three boxes and the boxes are blank	I dont know	sd	1
Tell me about why your boxes are blank	You cant split 17 into thirds	sd	4
Can you split 17 into thirds	No	b	1
Why not	There would be a remainder of two	sd	4
There would be a remainder of two	Its an odd number	sd	4
I can split that into thirds	Do it	sd	1
Do it	Wait its five	sd	4
Wait its five	You cant split 17 into thirds because you cant count up in threes up to 17	sv	5
You cant split 17 into thirds because you cant count up in threes up to 17	You can only count to 15 or 18	sd	5
What are the two whole numbers that we could skip count by three to get to that 17 is in between	15 and 18	sd	4
What am I going to do with the remaining two	You could put it into a fraction	sd	4
What would you do with the remaining two	You turn it into 23 because 3 and 23 You turn it into this	sv	4
You turn it into 23 because 3 and 23 You turn it into this	You split it into 23 because you split each remainder into thirds	sd	5
You split it into 23 because you split each remainder into thirds	Boom like that	sd	1
Boom like that	Then you make  because I can put in one and turn it into	sd	1
What do you think Lindsay	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	I think	sv	1
Jeremiah what did you do	No when Grant told me to do it it was like	sd	1
Im wondering what you think about this	Thats what I did and it	sd	1
The remainder is the fraction	That is	ba	1
I see on Eileens tape diagram she also wrote in these boxes 5 and 23	Nice we go to lunch in 15 minutes exactly 15 minutes	sd	1
What questions do you have about Eileens tape diagram	Why did she put 23 in the boxes	sd	3
Who can answer that	Not me	sd	1
Paula whyd she put 23 in the boxes	Eileen put in 23 into the boxes because  the remainder and  and Mr Calis used 13 to make a quilt	sd	2
Eileen put in 23 into the boxes because  the remainder and  and Mr Calis used 13 to make a quilt	The denominator is 13	sd	4
How much fabric did Mr Calis use in his quilt Angela	5 and 23	sd	4
5 and 23	Ms  can I go to the bathroom	sd	1
What does each of these boxes in the tape diagram represent	5 and 23	sd	4
5 and 23 but when I think about related to the fabric how much of the fabric does it represent	13	b	4
If Mr Calis used 13 of the fabric how much would he use	5 and 23	sd	4
Use a tape diagram to help you solve what is 13 of each	Thats easy	ba	1
Thats easy	I got my answer	sd	1
Mr Who	Mr G	sd	1
Thats right	My math new book with my homework is in my backpack	sd	1
Does that make sense	No	b	1
Youre all right	My thing is that do you know how it has use any whole number from one through nine	sd	3
My thing is that do you know how it has use any whole number from one through nine	How do you do negative numbers because I mean its not negative one through	sd	3
X can end up being negative even if all the other numbers are positive	Okay	b	1

Negative one third	Oh what	ba	1
Oh what	Thats so much more obvious	sd	1
Thats a pretty good one for a small possibility	Im just trying to figure out the highest value for X and the lowest possible value	sd	1
Thats a pretty good start and youre in the negatives	And for the box if you can only	sd	1
In this case its like the furthest into the negatives	I think youre figuring out the larger	sv	4

what do you think	8x981	b	5
You can only put in one number per box	Oh	b	1
Vera what do you think	1x29	b	5
We get 1x9 so X equals what	It will be seven	sd	4
This for largest or smallest	Largest	sd	4
Largest	8x91	b	5
If you add nine to both sides you get 8x10	Can you change the sign	sd	1
Its subtraction	But if youve got to get the smallest number	sd	4
Im going to put and L there for largest	You cant repeat	sd	4
Yes	The largest would be	sd	1
Anybody get something that they think is smaller than that	Wait so the smallest would be 9	sd	4
Wait so the smallest would be 9	I think 8	sv	2
This is the smallest because yes	Because yes	aa	1
On probably Thursday Ill give you one thats a little bit more complicated	Is it always going to be	sd	1
Its going to look exactly the same just this will be a subtraction sign and then the same rules	the last two numbers or the	sd	1

I took the screenshot	This one	sd	1
Do you have both of them	Yes I copied the second one	sd	1
Clipboard the second one should do	Should it go right here	sd	1
For the first one since you dont have it  picture should be from  it should be the second to last one that you did	The last one	sd	1
Whats up	Do I have to put my normal title	sd	1
Then you just need to make sure you include your username in your screenshots	It wouldnt let me in my first two	sd	1

It should be 21	Oh my God	ba	1
My recommendation is you should write down your answer for each of these questions	But I already did it look	sd	1
I know its a little frustrating but I want to make sure that were good to go on all	I finished this one and it was	sd	1
Then you have to take the unit test to get the last 40 points	See its just going back to the levels that Ive already done	sd	1
You can just put in a random answer to the end and then it will take you	Did you fill the last question	sd	1
I know sometimes its kind of weird	Im going to cry	sd	1
So they multiply this side by two and they multiply that side by two	I think I was wrong	sd	1
Its like thats  exception	Are you kidding me	sd	1
What would your first step be	I got all three of them	sd	1
The right column and the right column	You see its very frustrating	sd	1
Are you expected to do anything on this Google classroom assignment for homework	No	b	1

Were going to start with I will okay ready	I will develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on the coordinate grid	sd	1
Perfect	The sailboat	sd	4
Great	I dont remember Im pretty sure its 47 or 48	sd	1
So today you are going to have an original picture and you are going to create a rule where you are going to change ordered pairs to make a picture larger on a coordinate grid	Will we also make it wider and taller	sd	1
Helena is designing a logo for her school club	Theres 411	sd	1

The picture of the original trapezoid she drew on the coordinate grid is at the right	Miss Maack do you have a spare plastic bag	sd	1
Yes Ill get you one in a second	What page is it Miss Maack	sd	1
So double the first coordinate of all the points	So double x	sd	4
Scott say that louder	Uh double the xaxis	sd	4
Yep	Wouldnt it so shouldnt it be like where one sides flat and one is to the side	sd	4
What	So one sides flat and one is to the side	sd	4
So  I have 150 skittles divided by six students would you share your strategy for how you solved this please	I have not solved it yet I would just	sd	1
I have not solved it yet I would just	Im trying to find the	sd	1
Im trying to find the	I do know this	sd	1
I do know this	I would take numbers like six times 10 like six times 15 would be one number and then six times 20 and thats over	sd	5
I would take numbers like six times 10 like six times 15 would be one number and then six times 20 and thats over	I would like narrow it down in between those numbers	sd	5
So you would figure out how many times six would go into a 150	Yeah	b	1
Yes	I was going to say my strategy	sd	1
I was going to say my strategy	I just used long division because I have paper	sd	4
Okay	And I remembered how to do it	sd	1
Will you help with long division in just a little bit	Sure	b	1
We want to hear it	Just how I did it	sd	1
Okay go for it	So six cant go into one so you have to go onto five but six can go into 15 twice and you get 12	sd	5
So six cant go into one so you have to go onto five but six can go into 15 twice and you get 12	Then you subtract those and you get three	sv	5
So were going to bring down our zero okay	And then six goes into 30 five times	sd	5
what did you notice about 1 and six tenths and 4 tenths	They both have a decimal	sd	4
Did you notice anything about factors or maybe multiples of those two	No	b	1
Did you notice something Charlie	I was just going to say that if you took away the decimal point it would just be 16 divided by 4	sd	5
How do you know	Just because 16 divided by 4 is 4	sd	5
What are you math facts you wrote down real fast	I just knew 4 4 times is	sd	4
If you see 16 16 and a 4 well how can I manipulate that to make this problem a little bit easier to solve	Do you add a decimal point back there after you do that	sd	4
Yeah	Its not reRamona working on my camera for some reason	sd	1
Its not reRamona working on my camera for some reason	My computer is freaking out	sd	1
We can wait and come back if you want to	So were probably going to go over this in the next problem but the same strategy we just used Im assuming that it doesnt work when one of the numbers does not have a decimal	sd	4
Charlie since youre kind of on this what do you notice of the relationship between 90 and 45	Well if you can multiply 45 times 10 it equals 45 and 45 is half of 90	sd	5
What do you think	Ten times	sd	4
Nancy what are you thinking		b	4
So today our goal were going to talk about	Can I ask you a question about this	sd	3
Whats the question	So is it always going to be times 10	sd	1
Good observation	Thank you	aa	1
The first person who finds it gets an air high five	Found it	sd	1
What page Hank		b	1
Either this year or in elementary school	Does it have to be with ratios	sd	1
Oh no it can be any math tool	We used a division ladder a couple weeks ago	sd	4
What other tools have you guys used	Rulers	aa	4
Charlie	Calculators	sd	4
Calculators okay	Area models	sd	4
I was hoping someone would say area models	What page again	sd	1
Has anyone ever stayed in a yert before	We stayed in a yert before	sd	1
Can you tell us more about what it is	Its like a glorified tent a very glorified tent	sd	1
Edward what would you like to add	Its just a big hexagon and then on the ceiling there was a skylight at the top	sd	4
Its just a big hexagon and then on the ceiling there was a skylight at the top	With one room theres like beds	sd	1
I love it	Its like a tent that I drew	sd	1
Thanks for sharing	Wait are we supposed to draw one	sd	1
So this is reRamona important and this needs to be in your work	WOuldnt it be 12 people	sd	4
Because 4 times 10 is 40 and 24 times 10 is 240	You were saying you dont write down 40 yerts	sd	4
Hugh	I feel good about it I just kind of am confused on how you get the final answer the bottom one and the top one	sd	3
Of course	Im just confused on the top when you subtract from one and its 48 how do you get to 42	sd	3
So I subtracted six from the top and one from the bottom	Do you always subtract always only one from the bottom	sd	1
In this case one is in column one	Okay that makes sense	sd	1
How are you feeling about that so far	Couldnt we just start by multiply six by 20	sd	4
But if you can do that mentRamona totRamona do that	Thats what I was just thinking	sd	1
And we have a ratio of one adult per five students	Would this be an adults	sd	4
So 150  25 is 175 and then 30  5 is 35	Whats C2	ba	3
You need 35 chaperones	What is column three	sd	3
Column two is right here so I added the information in column two to the information in column three	It looks like	sd	1
Did you guys get to go to  ch fifth grade and when I was planning Cowell Wood this was exactly what I would do to figure out how many places we would need	Well you just do half of	sd	4
Penny what would you like to do first what could we do first to solve this	What I would want to do first to solve it isso we could get up to 130 players I think that we could do eight and one times 10	sd	5
Hank	You could multiply one and eight times by six	sd	5
So we could go back to the first column and why did you pick six	Because that would be 48 next and if you added that to 80 you would get 138 and you wanted to get as close to 130 as possible	sv	5
Ophelia can you help me add these two columns together	Add column one and column three	sd	1
Yeah lets add column two and column three	So we use eighty	sd	4
Ophelia what did you get for 80 plus 48	Would it be 128	sd	4
Ismeal what do you think we should do	We could add another column	sd	4
Were reRamona close right	Yeah	b	1
Lets just add column one right now	Yeah	b	1
So how many boxes will we have	The total well have 136	sd	4
What do you think Penny	I think Ramona will need 17 boxes	sd	4
Yeah how much will she have left over	Shell have six extra bars left over	sd	4
Go ahead and open to page	170 No 153	aa	1

Come join the group because thats going to help you find	I dont know if Im doing it right	sd	1
Its okay dont worry about it	Am I doing it right	sd	1
Go ahead and use the straight edge to connect them	Then you connect it to 8 and 51	sd	4
Then you connect it to 8 and 51	Im done	sd	1
Im done	Im not	sd	1
Im not	Whoa its a sailboat	sd	1
Whoa its a sailboat	Whoa	sd	1
Can you check with your group to see if anybody needs help with this	Im not smart	sd	1

Then Louis youre going to decide if you agree or disagree	I think its going to be the same	sv	4
I think its going to be the same	Go to 70 to 81 because I did a line if that makes sense	sd	5
Go to 70 to 81 because I did a line if that makes sense	I made a sailboat	sd	1
We go in here	didnt mean that	sd	1
didnt mean that	Im sorry	sd	1
All right I need you guys	I think that its going to be the same but bigger	sv	4
How	Multiply it by two	sd	4
You started what you did 81 to 51 so come back to these two points	I think thats supposed to go down to that too right	sv	4
Now youre going to come down to 1 2	Oh I see that	sd	1
Thats where your next point would be over one and up two	Because when you multiply zero by a number its still zero	sd	5
Because when you multiply zero by a number its still zero	Zero is still zero	sd	2
That is correct good	Because its going to be this part multiplied	sd	5
Yes	I put it last time	sd	1
Were all making the same pictures	This straight edge is really helping	sd	1
51	8 and 1	sd	4
5 7	Theres a new rule	sd	1
Did you talk to Liz about what happens when youre multiplying by zero	No	b	1
No	Yes you did	aa	1
All right Liz can you tell Louis again what happens when you multiply by zero	When you multiply by zero its still zero because youre	sd	4
When you multiply by zero its still zero because youre	Wait do I leave this one zero	sd	4
Before you start plotting them though I want you to make a conjecture which is a prediction based on what you know about math about what will the new sailboat look like	I think itll be way bigger	sd	4
I hear you say three size and Holly is saying two times the size	Wait will the sailboat look the same	sd	4
I dont know	It might be the same or it might be a differentlooking one	sd	4
It might be the same or it might be a differentlooking one	It should look the same	sd	4
It should look the same	I think it might be the same	sd	4
Why do you think it will be double	Because no one cares and it doesnt matter	sd	1
If youre doubling the value of the points Interesting	That times two	sd	4
How are you girls here	Im finished	sd	1
What do you know What about your math background knowledge makes you think itll look like a yacht	I think not like a yacht like a bigger boat that you dont really need one of these for	sd	4
A sail	Kind of like  like a surfboard with a sail on it	sd	4
Do you think that doubling the points will change the shape of the boat	Yes	b	1
What do you know about math	Mine will look nothing like yours	sd	3
Where is your new sailboat	I finished that sailboat	sd	1
What did you find out	Its the same thing just bigger	sd	4
Just bigger but how much bigger	Two times bigger	sd	4
How do you know its two times bigger	Because we multiplied the coordinates two times	sd	5
How will it look different	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	I just know its going to look different because its not changing the coordinates a lot differently because its not multiplying both making it look the same	sd	5
I just know its going to look different because its not changing the coordinates a lot differently because its not multiplying both making it look the same	Its going to look different because youre multiplying one part	sv	5
Because only one part of the coordinates is being multiplied its not going to maybe retain this in shape but look a little more different	Yes	b	1
Yes	Then some part of it will	sd	1
Do you think it will get taller or wider in that boat in that new shape	Probably taller because most of the  but only the first one got bigger	sd	4
Probably taller because most of the  but only the first one got bigger	No then that means it will be wider because thats the xaxis	sd	2
When we changed when we make the xaxis bigger	Its wider	sd	4
Do you want to work on new sailboat one or do you want to jump in where Liz and Louis are and work on a new sailboat	Where they are	sd	1
Why do you agree	It goes to zero because it doubles the zero zero	sd	5
You cant say its because shes smart	How do you double zero	ba	3
How do you double zero	Because it makes more sense	sd	1
I want you to go ahead and graph that new sailboat and then well see if it really does look	You only double the	sd	4
Okay	Im not supposed to double zero right	sd	4
Can zero be doubled	No	b	1
No	No	b	1
What are you starting to notice about the sailboat	Its looking the exact same but just really big	sd	4
How much bigger	Big	sd	4
Big	Wait times two bigger	sd	4
What makes	Because we have to multiply this by  and	sd	5
When you look at the  that the scale gets bigger by looking at the numbers	Oh it is on but you shouldnt be doing it	sd	1
Oh it is on but you shouldnt be doing it	Thats not helping them	sd	1
Thats not helping them	It is wider	sd	4
How much wider is it	Two times wider	sd	4
How do you know it was two times wider	Because we multiplied the first number by two and thats the xaxis	sd	5
Okay did anything change on the yaxis	No because	sd	1
What do you think is going to happen in  sailboat number three	Taller	aa	4
Why do you say taller	Because its the yaxis and if youre going to multiply that its going to get taller	sd	5
How much taller	Two times taller	sd	4
Are you looking Is the coordinate that you want to plot 02	Yes	b	1
Then on the yaxis	Yes	b	1
I know we didnt get to do all the sailboats	Im almost there	sd	1
When might someone have to do this in real life	It would be a reallife map and if youre  and you have to change places to go	sd	4
Youre going to play the game	Is this right	aa	1
All right were going to wrap up in just a minute but what are your thoughts on the new sailboat that you built	I am not smart	sd	1
Yes you did all aspects of it doubled by two	Yes	b	1
Yes	What are you doing	sd	1
I want to see them	I want to show you mine too	sd	1
Wyatt what are you thinking	Its not a multiple that can get to a 100 you would have to multiply it by 100 and then divide by the number you started with	sd	5
When you said it cant get to 100 what were you referring to	Eight	sd	4
What did we call that number in the bottom	The denominator	sd	4
Here what strategy could I use	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	You could divide by 10	sd	4
Why would dividing by 10 work	You want to get the denominator to 10	sd	4
You want to get the denominator to 10	That would be the quickest and easiest way to do it	sd	4
Lucas if I divide both of my values both my number and my percent by 10 what am I going to get	The numerator will be five	sd	4
The numerator will be five	The denominator will be 10	sd	4
Dwayne you want to do it		b	4
How am I going to start by setting up my ratio table	I suppose what were going to do is were going to do 10 on the bottom  and then divide by	sd	4
What are you thinking Andrew	Can you call on someone else because  It makes sense in my head the way I did it	sd	1
Jackson what are you thinking	I think its 80100	sv	4
I think its 80100	Because youre taking it out of like a whole level with that other one	sd	5
Because youre taking it out of like a whole level with that other one	Youre kind of like trying to get it to 100 and this one here is the opposite	sd	5
Youre kind of like trying to get it to 100 and this one here is the opposite	Youre trying to get it away from 100	sd	5
What can I do to get it down to 10 Cooper	Divide by 8	sd	4
What do you think Wyatt	I agree	aa	2
Why do you agree	Because if you divide by 10 the bottom the denominator will be 10 then you would get your new number on the numerator	sv	5
What would it be	Eight	sd	4
What are you thinking	Do we have to simplify the fraction	sd	4
If I ate 10 of a bag of MMs where there were 80 of them	Okay	b	1
Ellie are you ready	Yes	b	1
What do I need to do to get to 20	You would multiply by 2	sd	4
If I multiply by two on the bottom what do I need to do	Multiply by two on the top	sd	4
To get what		b	4
Are you guys okay back there	Yes	b	1
Yes	We have a pacer test	sd	1
Help me get to 10 please Drew	Divide by 10	sd	4
Whats it going to be if I divide 100 by 10 what will be at		b	4
What do I need to do	Get 10 to 20	sd	1
Yes	Multiply by two	sd	4
Love it and what do I need to do to the top	Multiply by two	sd	4
What would I get	You would get 5	sd	4
Claire do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	aa	2
I agree	Its not 5	sd	2
Its not 5	Oh its just five	sd	2
Oh its just five	Yeah	b	1
Just the number five	I agree that like two doubling	sd	2
Guys youre just learning so much from each other	For finals were basically doing everything weve worked on	sd	1
Everything	Im so scared	sd	1
Im so scared	How many days do we have before the test	sd	1
Its matching cards	Matching cards	sd	1
Its 35 matching cards so 35 cards	Wait its not a test	sd	1
Wait its not a test	It is a test	sd	1
It is a test but youve matching card format	Its not like a writing test	sd	1
Correct	Yes	b	1
No its on matching cards	Is it	sd	1
Remember your matching cards where you sit and you make a circle with your cards	Oh	b	1
Hold up your pen like you are the	Statue of Liberty	sd	1
James solve that problem please	Me	sd	1
Lucas show me your very best Leaning Tower of Pisa	Does it lean to the right	sd	1
You guys ready	This is what the Leaning Tower looks like	sd	1
Both from 400 to 40 you can use other columns	I did that	sd	1
Yes Cooper	Why cant 300 to get to 40	sd	3
Why cant 300 to get to 40	You should divide by four	sd	2
Yes Ben	I did the 75 divide by 75 does that work	sd	4
You just do some work off to the side or think super hard to do it	Yes	b	1
Im not going to say it doesnt but its just much easier to do this	Will we get it wrong if we do it that way	sd	1
Once you use your ratio table you should find that he paid 96	Yes	b	1
Yes	He got good deal	sd	1
Yes there will be so if data was something that was tricky for you I would go to the website and I would find some links that you can use in order to practice some things from data	minutes to eat breakfast	sd	4
minutes to eat breakfast	I got six	sd	4
Theyre not eating breakfast	Theyre brother to	sd	1
Jackson Im not your brother	Ms Davies Mr Rick was going to bring the  but then he forgot	sd	1
Ariana whats your question	How is the means six	sd	3
Is that cool with you	Yes	b	1
Yes Lucas	In the mean you would for after youve said we would divide 20 because theres 20 pieces of data divided by 120 because that	sd	5
120 divided by 20	Yes	b	1
Yes	Thank you	aa	1
Yes	On the mean you did the multiplication for like	sd	4
Yes	We are supposed to disregard	sd	4
May I have your full attention please	Yes	b	1
Is there anybody here who has been to Costco recently	All the time	sd	1
Lucas why do you enjoy Costco	I have no idea	sd	1
Amber why do you enjoy Costco	They have cheap things	sd	4
They have cheap things	They have samples	sd	4
They have samples	They have really really cheap food	sd	4
Tell me more	There is people  its a really big store that has almost anything	sd	4
There is people  its a really big store that has almost anything	Thats from TV remotes all the way up to I dont know	sd	4
Why  Tell me more about this cost thing	They always have deals	sd	4
Tell me more about this cost thing	You can buy more for less	sd	4
You can buy more for less	Its like theres	sd	1
What does that mean	It means like if youre buying something you get it like half off	sd	4
It means like if youre buying something you get it like half off	I know I know	sd	1
I know I know	You can get more of it too	sd	4
You can get more of it too	No please please please pick me Ms Davies	sd	1
Im looking for who has been sitting quietly Wyatt	I just got	sd	1
I just got	I always go there  shopping just get all my stuff from the sample bar	sd	1
Thats a great way to go	They dont tell you you can only have one	sd	1
Tell us your love of Costco	They sell their food really cheaper	sd	5
They sell their food really cheaper	You then get most of their money because you cant shop there without a membership	sd	5
You then get most of their money because you cant shop there without a membership	You get a lot of food and my family whenever we go I like it because my mom lets me get anything I want there because she loves Costco  Im spending a lot more time and money and	sd	5
I feel like you should work at Costco someday	No I want to work in IKEA	sd	1
I feel we should take a field trip to Costco sometime	Yes	b	1
Eyes up here please	Theyre always like they  big so much who they can get into	sd	4
What I would like for you guys to do is were going to do a couple of example problems here	That reminds me of	sd	1
Julia	Unit price is asking how much is each lemon individually	sd	4
Unit price is asking how much is each lemon individually	Like how much would technically one lemon be if it was like this thing	sd	4
What is my unit price for lemons	How much money are you	sd	4
Andrew what would be the cost of one lemon	25 cents	sd	4
Tell us how you got that	Because 1 and 25 cents can be divided by 5 you just do that and you get 25 cents	sd	5
Awesome	I knew that four lemons are a 1 so if you add one more thats 20 and thats	sd	5
How did you know four lemons were a 1	If you have four 25 cents is a 1 and then you have another 25 cents	sd	4
If you have four 25 cents is a 1 and then you have another 25 cents	I knew that 4 quarters equals 25 cents and 4 quarters make 1 so if you had another quarter it had 2	sd	5
I knew that 4 quarters equals 25 cents and 4 quarters make 1 so if you had another quarter it had 2	Thats what I was trying to say	sd	2
What is the unit price for 1 orange	How do you make a division	sd	3
How do you make a division	How do you do	aa	3
Lina go for it		b	5
	I think they are 75 cents because 75 plus 75 is 150 and then when you multiply it by 2 you get 300 then add it again	sd	5
All right and for your math classes today	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	Thank you	aa	1
Hey you guys if youre going to work on the whiteboard can you put this so they can hear what youre saying	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	Yes	b	1
Anna	Six twelfths	b	4
And the denominator is what did you say		b	4
Why is it 12	Because theres 12 sections	sd	5
So what is it	One third	sd	4
You got what	Three fifteenths	sd	4
Matt whats the answer to this problem	Three fifteenths	sd	4
Joey	The blocks that are shaded	sd	4
Okay so the shaded	Double shaded	sd	4
Cooper	If you do three fifths and then one third across then three of those fifths would equal three I guess	sd	5
If you do three fifths and then one third across then three of those fifths would equal three I guess	So you double shade a third but also youre shading a part where three fifths were shaded	sd	5
Isaac	It represents the	sd	1
I couldnt hear	It represents the  It represents the bottom	sd	4
It represents the  It represents the bottom	How many squares are on the bottom	sd	4
How many	Parts	ba	4
How many parts it takes to	Fill the square	aa	4
Still waiting	Well it is the area	sd	4
Well it is the area	There is 15 squares inside the one square	sd	4
So what does the 15 represent	The 15 represents how many squares there are to make a whole	sd	4
Anna		b	4
How do you know	Six times five	sd	5
Joey	Because five times six is 30	sd	5
Because five times six is 30	With the area when you draw six lines and five lines thats basically five times six	sd	5
You can draw it if you want	Its so hard to explain	sd	1
Really loudly	The reason why is because basically showing it on an area model if you count up the parts theres 30 obviously	sd	5
The reason why is because basically showing it on an area model if you count up the parts theres 30 obviously	And then you will only shade in 10	sd	5
And then you will only shade in 10	And then you can prove it on an area model	sd	5
And then you can prove it on an area model	Even though we know its going to be 10 we can find it on an area model by shading in	sd	5
You want to try it	Kind of explain what the answer of the five sixths	sd	1
Why 10 would be the numerator	Because youre kind of Basically what youre doing is youre just multiplying the denominator by the denominator and the numerator by the numerator	sd	5
Because youre kind of Basically what youre doing is youre just multiplying the denominator by the denominator and the numerator by the numerator	And you also know that because lets say you shade five sixths on the square thing and then five halves	sd	5
Two fifths	Two fifths I mean	sd	1
Two fifths I mean	Then youll just have 30 as your answer	sd	4
Then youll just have 30 as your answer	And the remainder Not the remainder	sd	4
No youd have 30 total squares but	Thered be 10 squares total in the whole entire rectangle	sd	4
So the 10 would be shaded if you did the area model and thats really all it is	So youre just basically multiplying	sd	4
Aiden	Fifteenths	sd	4
And then whats the numerator	Eight	sd	4
And how do you know	Because four times two is eight	sd	5
Did we use an area model yesterday	Yes	b	1
Remember I showed you the easy way to do this yesterday didnt I	Yeah	b	1
All right	Thats a good way to check your answer	sv	4
May I get over here and get my warmer coat	Sure	b	1
Thank you	It is kind of cold in here	sd	1
Thats you said true on your very first one	I was supposed to say false	sd	4
Explain it to me	I thought it meant five tenths is larger than	sd	4
So less than means what	Smaller	sd	4
So we agree that fivetenths is less than forty nine hundredths	No	b	2
Because I have five whole tenths but I have forty nine hundredths which shows me that I only have four tenths and then the nine hundredths	Yeah	b	1
What do you think Eric	I think thats false	sv	4
How come	Its one in eightyeights and one	sd	4
Eightyeight hundredths	Thousandths	sd	4
Thousandths	Yeah and versus ninetenths thats just automatically bigger than it	sd	2
Right	Nine is bigger than eight	sd	4
And the last one Mr Mason twelve and thirty five hundredths is less than twelve in four hundredths	I thought that that was true	sd	1
Okay	Because twelve in thirty five hundredths is broken down into smaller pieces and twelve in four tenths is bigger than twelve thirty five hundredths	sd	5
Now put your dry erase or caps on	Can we erase	sd	1
Six in sevenhundred and eighty five thousandths is greater than six in seventy nine hundredths	I said it was false because well no its true becauseum	sd	4
Which one is going to be bigger	Um six in seventynine hundredths	sd	4
So is this true or false		aa	4
Okay	Oh wow	b	1
Explain to me why thats false	Um I didnt really know what the question was	sd	3
Um I didnt really know what the question was	I	b	1
Explain to me why this is false	Um this is false because one is um zero nine nine the one will prevail because theres a zero before the ninety nine	sd	5
So which is smaller	The the ninetynine thousandths	sd	4
Ninetynine thousandths is less than so shouldnt it have been true versus your false	I I thought you said that false was first	sd	4
And youre going to do twothirds of twothirds	Can you solve it	sd	1
Mr Ethan	Yes	b	1
Tell me were going to do a little sage and scribe here	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay	b	1
I would like you to tell me how to make my area model first	So first I split it into thirds	sd	4
And what way did you do thirds	I did it the um	sd	1
This way	Yeah	b	1
I broke it into thirds for this one	And then I color two in	sd	4
Like that Mr Ethan	And then I broke it into another third  to be	sd	4
And how did I how did you break that one into thirds	I went down	sd	4
Like this	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	And then I colored two more in	sd	4
Like this	Yeah	b	1
Okay	And then I had four double shades so itd be four down	sd	4
These four boxes here are	Are double shaded	sd	4
So what is my answer	Fourninths	aa	4
I have four boxes double shaded	And nine total	sd	4
Now Austin tell me the easy way to do this	Um so were going to do 3 times 3	sd	4
Then what do I do	Then you do 2 times 2 equals 4	sd	5
Then you do 2 times 2 equals 4	And then you get 4	sd	5
So	Can we may erase	sd	1
Is the product greater than or less than the factors	Alone	sd	1
Alone	Like the factor alone	sd	1
Charlotte	Yes	b	1
Tell me why	Because twothirds is bigger than fourninths	sd	5
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
What are these called	Tick marks	sd	4
Thank you for working with me	Thank you for working with me	sd	1
What what do we use them for	So if you were to put them into groups you would represent the  If you if you	sd	4
Agree or disagree	Agree	sd	2
Alison what did you and your partner talk about	Um me and my partner talked about the tick marks were there because they were helping us place the lines so we know where to plot the lines so we can have our fractions	sd	5
Morgan can you build off that please	Um	b	1
Specifically	Me and my partner did um we are doing that the tick marks could be for coordinate grids	sd	4
Aaron	What me and my partner said is to divide the squares	sd	4
To divide the squares into what Josh	Thirds	sd	4
Thirds	Um maybe even squares	sd	2
Well Zach what do you want to add	I think I said that the its kind of like a coordinate grids where like if onethird twothird threethirds	sd	4
You know why this called an area model right	Because it helps you find	sd	1
Because it helps you find the area excellent	Wow	ba	1
Wow	It doesnt want to move	sd	1
It doesnt want to move	It doesnt want to go	sd	1
How does this area relate to multiplication Will	Um	b	1
How does this area model relate to multiplication	Um so I thought we	sd	1
Im sorry what	Um I said so then the  you dont have to do 3 times 3	sd	4
Why would I why am I multiplying 3 times 3	Because of the d	sd	1
Because its called the what	D	b	1
D	Denominator	aa	4
Label yours	Oh um	b	1
I want just to see how everybody labels it	Wait like labeling	sd	1
Come up here and explain what you did my darling	Oh this is not working	sd	1
Please be nice to me today	Are you going to kick the smartboard	sd	1
Okay	Since we were shading since for the problem where we had to shade two thirds here this would be	sd	5
Since we were shading since for the problem where we had to shade two thirds here this would be	So for the problem we had to shade twothirds so it would be twothirds here because you would shade these twothirds	sd	5
So for the problem we had to shade twothirds so it would be twothirds here because you would shade these twothirds	And then for the problem we had to do twothirds here so you had to shade these twothirds and then there would be one third	sd	5
And then for the problem we had to do twothirds here so you had to shade these twothirds and then there would be one third	But we dont do one third for the problem	sd	5
But we dont do one third for the problem	But that would be one third	sd	5
Or do they only represent it showing two of the thirds shaded	They only represent showing two	sd	4
One third two thirds which leaves me how many thirds	Ninths	sd	4
But if I break that into ninths if I label it one ninth two ninths I dont have enough ninths do I	No	b	1
No its not Will	Is it 1 by 1	sd	4
Charlotte	Um	b	1
Area	Is it 3	sd	4
Whats the formula for area	Length times width	sd	4
Multiply my length times my width	9	b	4
9	1	b	2
If the if its one by one	Oh 2	b	4
Oh 2	What	ba	1
Okay whats our misconception Zach	Shes adding the 2 or shes adding 1 and 1 not multiplying 1 and 1	sd	2
Shes adding the 2 or shes adding 1 and 1 not multiplying 1 and 1	Oh	b	1
Whats 1 times 1	1	b	4
Haley	Yes	b	1
What are the dimensions of the shaded um	What the heck	sd	1
Im trying to move it	What is that	sd	1
What is that	Whoa	sd	1
Whoa	What	ba	1
What	You just made it go smaller	sd	1
What are the dimensions of the shaded squares	2 by two thirds by two thirds	sd	4
What is the area of the shaded rectangle John	Um	b	1
And Michael what would the multiplication sentence be	2 times 2	sd	4
2 times 2	Twothirds times twothirds	sd	4
And what does that equal Michael	Four ninths	sd	4
So Im going to see if it filled these in for me so I can show you how they	Wait if you scroll down maybe on the other one no	sd	1
So then the area would be length times width which is 1 times 1 equals everybody		b	4
So Haley jumped up and said Oh well the dimensions of the shaded are its two thirds here and two thirds here do you understand why you couldnt write one third one third one third one third	Yeah	b	1
Because then	It would be onethird by onethird	sd	4
And onethird by onethird is only	One third	sd	4
You guys in the back stay where you are	You want us to move our desks	sd	1
Aaron Nate John youre going to come place yourselves in this middle area right here	Im standing up	sd	1
What are these tick marks worth	Dont know	sd	1
So the top number or the bottom number	Bottom	sd	4
You did both pages	Oh both	sd	1
What do you think theyre worth	Threesixteenths	sd	4
Mason explain to me	Uh I think it was uh in fourths	sd	4
Why is it in fourths Michael uh I mean Mason	Because the um the smaller	sd	5
So if I label this its going to be one fourth	One fourth	sd	1
Noah does that make sense	Uhhuh	b	1
What are you confused about	That the	sd	1
If I have one fourth two fourths three fourths here Noah what am I going to have here	Uh one fourth	sd	4
What did you write	Multiply by denominator	aa	4
What did you write	Um I dont understand but	sd	3
What did you write Charlotte	Um I wrote 1 by 1	sd	4
What	I wrote 1 by 1	sd	4
So first of all how do I find area Austin	Um	b	1
Nope what is the model for area	Length times width	sd	4
Okay whatd you get	One fourth	sd	4
So sixteen is the whole	So first time	sd	1
Will do you see where he got it	I	b	1
So now I want you to write a multiplication sentence for this	Two sixths	sd	4
Two sixths	Uh I got three fourths and two sixths	sd	2
Uh I got three fourths and two sixths	I got three fourths and two sixths	sd	2
I got three fourths and two sixths	I got two sixths and three fourths	sd	2
I got two sixths and three fourths	Its the same	sd	2
Multiplication TopIt three digit and four digit	Yeah thats the biggest	sd	4
You guys I would like you just do the three digit by two digit to start	Okay	b	1
Do you all agree or did you get different answers	We got different answers	sd	2
How did you label your tick marks Noah	Um	b	1
Right here	Um no yeah	b	1
Right here	Yes	b	1
Then what	And then I do two fourths	sd	4
Two fourths	And then um	sd	1
Okay then what did you do down here	Uh I did one fourth	sd	4
Why do you disagree Charlotte	Because its not	sd	1
See where you made your mistake	Yeah	b	1
What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangles	Um	b	1
Who did not agree who did not have this part	I accidentally	sd	1
What is the area of the shaded rectangle Will	Um the area of the shaded rectangle  would be	sd	1
Do you agree with that	I do	sd	1
Charlotte what is the multiplication sentence you wrote	Um two fourths by	sd	4
What coordinate do you always do first	X	b	4
What one do you do last	Y	b	4
Caleb will you read our learning intention please	improving and breaking apart	sd	1
Okay so Eric can you give me an example of a mixed number	Like 3 and one fourth	sd	4
Isaac can you give me an example of a fraction thats greater than one	Five thirds	sd	4
We can also compose it into what would be the improper fractions here anybody	Three and two fourths	sd	4
Three and two fourths	So the only	sd	1
Improper fraction	14 fourths	sd	4
And everybody say composing	Composing	sd	1
Composing	Composing	sd	1
Isaac will you read that please	I will know I am successful when I can  improper fraction	sd	1
Between two numbersOkay so Anna what did you get	One and two	sd	4
What two whole numbers is that one in between	Three and two	sd	4
How did you know its between two and three	Because its two  is how many twos are in five and then five is in between no its in between two and three	sd	5
So Eric you want to explain that for us	I am honestly kind of confused thats just  increased but also the top number did as the equal like the same cuz Im kinda confused with this	sd	3
But tell me what is that	That is um	sd	1
17 divided by three right	Yeah	b	1
Sophia and you tell us why	Because four times six equals 24	sd	5
Because four times six equals 24	Theres two left over	sd	5
Theres two left over	So thats six	sd	5
Whats the strategy	Multiplication	aa	4
Hello right	Right	b	1
First	Record it as a fraction	sd	4
And what is that fraction	15	b	4
Anna	So I kind of did the same thing	sd	2
So I kind of did the same thing	and so four times five is twenty and twenty divided by five is four	sd	5
Say really loud like youre screaming across the room because I want to draw a picture of it	So five times five and three times five is 15 and four fives	sd	5
Is there a different way for you to come up with to n reflect that number	Four is ten	sd	4
So if you can	What else do we have	sd	3
How many fifths	Theres nothing but 21	sd	4
So that would be three and	I dont know what to do	sd	3
Alright any any great ideas	Oh me and Joey are kind of stuck because we get three times seven equals 21	sd	5
Oh me and Joey are kind of stuck because we get three times seven equals 21	And we dont know much what to do because we did three groups of seven	sd	5
And we dont know much what to do because we did three groups of seven	And now we dont know how to turn it into a fraction	sd	3
Anna what were you thinking	If you could take 21 fifths and multiply it by	sd	4
Landon I heard you give me one	I did two and	sd	4
Okay can you come up and explain yours	I actually figured out three of them	sd	1
Stand next to it	So I figured out two wholes and 11 fifths	sd	4
So I figured out two wholes and 11 fifths	Two wholes and then 5 10 11 fifths	sd	4
So this is your edreports three what did I say	Three and 23	sd	1
Pages 90 and 91	Two and 35	sd	1
So	That means one and 13	sd	4
That means one and 13	One and 13	sd	4
If you have one left over it would be	Thats a lot	sd	1
So does that make it easier	Three and 23	sd	1
Can you show me a mixed number	Two	sd	4
Yep	And	sd	1
So can you pull out one whole	Yeah	b	1
How many thirds	Theres two and two thirds	sd	4
How many thirds are left	One third	sd	4
No	Two	sd	4
Or so that would be one	Okay	b	1
Okay so you guys can get started on pages 90 and 91	Can we work together	sd	1
So what is that next number	Im going to use this	sd	1
Im going to use this	Right now honestly	aa	1
How many parts does it take to make a whole	I can never get an	sd	1
Just go	Find another name for	sd	1
So youre accounting for this one how many thirds is that	We watch this for the example	sd	1
So write that	So how many squares	sd	3
Thats the numerator	Four threes	aa	4
Four threes	So one and 12 tenths	sd	2
So one and 12 tenths	Thats already	sv	1
One and 13	I need one more	sd	4
Anna	Can I go  to the bathroom	sd	1
Do we know the base of the triangle in part B	Yes	b	1
How can we find the height	Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
Is there a faster way than Pythagorean theorem	Three Four Five	sd	4
Where should I  for the hypotenuse	Dont you go to  the smallest one and divide	sd	4
What strategy do I need to use to find that last side	Pythagorean theorem	sd	4
What is it		b	4
Do we know the base	We do not	sd	4
Whats the seven	Adjacent	sd	4
If we multiply those sides by seven then I need a calculator person to plug in seven tangent of 62	1880	b	4
What was it	1880 x 7	sd	4
Times seven	Oh 1316	b	4
And Ill need help from another person with a calculator	It will be 461	sd	4
Do I know the base of this triangle	Yeah	b	1
Do I know the height of this triangle	No	b	1
So lets think about trigonometry Ana	Why is the base 10	sd	3
Sine of 38 equals H over 10 10 sine of 38 equals H	H equals 616	sd	4
From this step Becca	Yeah	b	1
Like one 12 is 05	Oh wait hold on	sd	1
Oh wait hold on	I think I mightve	sd	1
That could be true as well	Its	sd	1
Then thats not so bad	Yeah	b	1
Yeah	I got 51	sd	4
I got 51	I got the first two	sd	4
So 05 x 19 x 616	Youre drinking alcohol	sd	1
What was that AJ	The opposite angle is 120	sd	4
The opposite angle is 120	And the other two are 60	sd	4
Whats this one going to be		b	4
We want to find X and we want to find H	Cant you just divide by two	sd	4
For which one	To get the short leg	sd	4
If X is four	Four square root of three	sd	4
4 x a squared is	Root three	sd	4
What Id do wrong in this problem	Oh wasnt it a parallelogram	sd	4
Oh wasnt it a parallelogram	So you dont have to think about half B and find the B H	sd	4
Sorry about that	So then the area would be 44 root 3	sd	4
You have it way back on page one	12 x the height x base 1   base 2	sd	4
Do I know the height of his trapezoid	No	b	1
Do I know base 1 and base 2	Yes	b	1
Do we know any of those sides of that triangle	No	b	1
One of the sides of that right triangle	The base of the right triangle would be 14 minus 13 divided by tangent 7	sd	5
And whats the seven	Adjacent	sd	4
I know adjacent	Tangent	sd	4
Anybody else get that too	I got 768	sd	4
Exactly	Yeah	b	1
Did you do 108 instead of 1078	Yeah	b	1
Point six	Yes	b	1

Yeah thats another one of the things	He also grows turnips	sd	1
He also grows turnips	Yeah thats also he does good with	sd	1

Alright so Austin turn your mic on	Yeah	b	1
Okay how did you solve inaudible	I rounded five eights to a half	sd	4
I rounded five eights to a half	And then seven eight to a whole	sd	4
And then seven eight to a whole	Then I added in I got one and a half	sd	4
What is the total	One and one half	sd	4
	128ths	sd	4
What	Another way to do it is 12 minus eight	sd	4
Miss Elliot	do we turn our cameras off and then put them back on	sd	1
Question	Mrs  Strathom	sd	1
Mrs  Strathom	Do we all the same questions	sd	1
Okay	Wait Miss Strathom mine says Burt threw a stone one 714th yards	sd	1
Wait Miss Strathom mine says Burt threw a stone one 714th yards	Tilly threw a stone 914th of the yard	sd	1
Tilly threw a stone 914th of the yard	What is a reasonable estimate of the difference between their two throws	sd	1
Okay so make a reasonable estimate	Its probably	sd	1
so what are the numbers Adam	One  and714ths	sd	4
Okay	and then 914ths	sd	4
Then what is a reasonable estimate	I think its one no wait	sd	4
I think its one no wait	I think its one yard	sv	4
What is that closest to	Two	sd	4
Two	Oh okay	b	1
one and 714ths is really what	One and one half	sd	4
Is that closer to a hole or a half	A whole	sd	4
How many more Do I need to get to a whole with 914ths	I dont know	sd	3
What is the difference between nine and 14	You need five	sd	4
Whats half of 14	That would be seven	sd	4
How many do I need piecewise	Two	sd	4
Okay am I closer to a half or a whole	A whole	sd	4
I need Five more pieces to get to a whole	a half	sd	4
How does one and a half and a half equal two and a half Adam	oh two	ba	4
How am I going to turn one and four sixth into an improper fraction	Maybe first we could estimate five sixth to a whole	sd	4
You are absolutely right	And then four sixth to a half	sd	4
Okay	Then	sd	1
So what would be a good estimate for your answer	Maybe	sd	1
with one and a half plus one	One and one and one half	sd	1
So because hes giving it though were gonna subtract arent we	Yeah	b	1
Because was that one and a half minus one Just a half	Yeah	b	1
Austin how many pieces is that one whole worth	Six sixths	sd	4
So if you add six to four how much do you have		b	4
10 Sixth minus five sixth	Yeah	b	1
Yeah		b	1
So Julia what is 818th plus 918ths	Im not good at adding let me think	sd	1
Are my denominators the same	Yeah	b	1
So whats eight plus 9		b	4
Whats your answer	1718ths	aa	4
Hey Adam where are we up buddy	On the second question and my dad just told me how to do it	sd	1
Okay	I still need your help though	sd	3
I still need your help though	Cuz	b	1
Whats the question	Okay so it says which statement is true	sd	1
Okay so it says which statement is true	Theres four answers	sd	1
Theres four answers	Lucy has one and fourth one and four 12ths	sd	1
Im sorry Adam read it again	Okay	b	1
Okay	Lucy has one and fourth 12ths cups of grapes	sd	1
Lucy has one and fourth 12ths cups of grapes	Don has a one an 1112ths cups of grapes	sd	1
Don has a one an 1112ths cups of grapes	together They have two and 712ths cups of grapes	sd	1
Do you agree with that or disagree with that	I disagree with that because thats kind of a subtraction problem	sd	5
You know if he wants to know all together How much they have wouldnt I be adding them	Yeah	b	1
Read the question to me again	Lucy has one and four 12ths cups of grapes	sd	1
Lucy has one and four 12ths cups of grapes	Dawn has one 1112ths cups of grapes	sd	1
Dawn has one 1112ths cups of grapes	together they have two and 712 cups of grapes	sd	1
Do you agree or disagree with that	I think I agree	sv	4
What What do I have to choose an answer between Adam	Oh so for like each one	sd	1
Every bit of it	Rachel	aa	1
Rachel	Rachel has one 715ths cups of chocolate chips	sd	1
Rachel has one 715ths cups of chocolate chips	Maya has eight fifteenths of a cup of chocolate chips	sd	1
Maya has eight fifteenths of a cup of chocolate chips	Rachel has 1015ths of a cup of of a cup more chocolate chips than Maya	sd	1
How am I talking about	No becuase I thought you were you talking about the second one	sd	1
No becuase I thought you were you talking about the second one	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Do not get upset	This is hard	sd	3
This is hard	What do you do when Youre done	sd	1
Dont worry you and I are going to do this later	Okay	b	1
So friends I need you all to come back to me	Miss Strathom	sd	1
Yes	Im stuck on how to like estimate the decimal kinda	sd	3
Were not estimating decimals	not the decimal like estimate the fraction	sd	3
So what are the two numbers buddy	So theres 18 and 20 and then 9 and 20	sd	1
Okay so 18 twentieths is closest to a half or a whole	a whole	sd	4
and nine twentieths is that closer to a half or a whole	A half	sd	4
So your estimate would be one and a half right	Yeah	b	1
Good	Thank you	aa	1
Youre welcome	This is hard	sd	3
This is hard	I forgot how to do this	sd	3
Okay so	At one oclock	sd	1
At one oclock	Cuz I need to work with you	sd	3
Or the day inauidble	Wait Im not done yet	sd	1
Wait Im not done yet	Do I keep working	sd	1
And did you finish	No	b	1
Adam you and I will meet at 1245 today	T	b	1
Yes	Can you look at my score cuz i dont know if i still should work with you	sd	1
Oh darlin you dont need to work with me	Okay	b	1
youre good	Mrs Strathom	sd	1
Yes	For the last for number five It wants Which statements true	sd	1
For the last for number five It wants Which statements true	Do I have to do an estimate	sd	3
Do I have to do an estimate	Or can I just do the answer	sd	3
Austin If you would like to join me later this afternoon You can	Okay	b	1
Well so Charlie apparently you need to come with me this afternoon too cuz youre gonna retake this	T Its just its just its just I couldnt figure out how to do this	sd	1
Thats fine buddy	T	b	1
T	I finished	sd	1
Okay so we are now going to jump into our writing	Can we put our fraction circles up	sd	1
Put your fraction circles away	T	b	1
Yes	I just finished	sd	1
Oh good	Can we go back and fix our body paragraph one first	sd	1
Show me with a thumbs up if you need to go back and fix your similarities	T	b	1
T	My mom was checking my paper	sd	1
My mom was checking my paper	And then me and her did both of the similarities	sd	1
And then me and her did both of the similarities	So then she told me I technically have two paragraphs done	sd	1
Okay so um it is now time for you to um take a quick little break	What time do you want us back at	sd	1
So 10 minutes	Okay bye	aa	1
See you in ten	I got a three	sd	4
Julia are you back yet	Are we gonna do read aloud	sd	1
We are going to do read aloud so you guys may color if you would like	we can have snacks right	sd	1
Julia	miss Strathom	sd	1
yes	um since we did cookies we also decorated our tree I dont know if you really see it	sd	1
um since we did cookies we also decorated our tree I dont know if you really see it	We decorated my grandmas tree	sd	1
We decorated my grandmas tree	My grandpa did it too	sd	1
Southern Sudan 2009	Oh are you supposed to still record or no	sd	1
What else is true	You have a 10 but you have also 100 you have to change the 10 to be 100 it cant be in	sd	4
What did we have to do	Add the top so you	sd	4
Yes so Viviana do we only add the numerator	Yes	b	1
Yes you want to add something to that	Change the denominator	sd	4
Do you think these two things apply to subtracting fractions as well	Possibly	aa	1
Do you think we have to have the same denominator	Possibly	aa	1
Give me a complete sentence	Theres 58 of the pizzas left	sd	4
Its true for subtraction also	They do	sd	4
We didnt add them this time we did what	We subtracted	sd	4
Kaylee	The denominator is going to be 12 because of the other denominators	sd	5
The denominator is going to be 12 because of the other denominators	Five take away two is three	sd	5
Kaylee says our denominator stays the same so we keep our 12 and we just look at five minus two and get	Three	sd	4
Did you get it	Yes	b	1
Jade walk us through it	The answer is 4500 feet if you do if you subtract 67 from 22 its 45	sd	5
Okay what about our denominators	The denominators are the same	sd	4
Sorry I should have had this ready	What time does it say it is	sd	1
I think our internet is moving as slow as we are today	Then we might have to do it on paper	sd	1
Then we might have to do it on paper	In computer most of us had hard time getting into Exclusive	sd	1
Eli walk me through it	The answer is 28	sd	4
Whatd you do	I took 78 and then minus 58 and then I subtracted 75	sd	5
You got	28	b	4
	Yes	b	1
Jahari nice and loud	The average in February is 52100 of an inch	sd	1
The average in February is 52100 of an inch	On average how many more	sd	1
Precipitation	Yes is there in February than in January	sd	1
Were talking about precipitation but how are they measuring precipitation	The average	sd	4
Lets go down to our second problem and identify what our whole is	I cant find the journal	sd	1
Judith can you read it	A vegetable lasagna recipe called for 34 teaspoon of pepper	sd	1
A vegetable lasagna recipe called for 34 teaspoon of pepper	Caleb used 14 teaspoon when he grilled the vegetable	sd	1
Caleb used 14 teaspoon when he grilled the vegetable	He added the rest to the cheese mix	sd	1
He added the rest to the cheese mix	How much pepper did Caleb add to the cheese mix	sd	1
Whatre we measuring in what is our whole	Teaspoon	sd	4
You think you can do it	Yes	b	1
You can get snacks and then youre working on imagine	Were not doing page 170	sd	1
Were not doing page 170	Can you help me	sd	3
Lacy	into different parts	sd	4
What does partial products mean to you when we did partial products	Partial products means splitting multiplication of bigger numbers into smaller numbers	sd	4
Michael	I think partial products means when you have a big multiplication problem you break it up into tiny pieces to get products	sd	5
I think partial products means when you have a big multiplication problem you break it up into tiny pieces to get products	Then at the end you add all the products	sd	5
Cameron	So that it could be easier	sd	5
Youre right but what do you mean by easier	Its a little bit easier to solve the problem	sd	4
Think about it	Because if we dont want to multiply a big number	sd	4
We are multiplying big numbers but think of exactly how were doing	so many times	sd	4
what do my horns do	Your horns  the value	sd	4
Were multiplying singledigit numbers with what at the end of them	Zero	sd	4
Whats seven times five	35	b	4
whats it called	The dividend	sd	4
What does this tell us Cameron		b	1
	How many pieces	sd	4
Keep going Cameron	in total	sd	4
Total	Marbles	aa	4
Daniela	Divisor	b	4
Lacy	Number of marbles per bag	sd	4
It can be the number per group or it can be	The	sd	1
Already got that one	How many bags like	sd	4
How many bags like	How many bags you have	sd	2
How many bags you have	how many bags you have	sd	2
how many bags you have	Groups	sd	2
If the six tells us the number of groups then this tells us	Oh its just backwards	sd	4
Make sense	Yes	b	1
Does that make sense to everybody	Yes	b	1
Guess what you do in your thinking box	Think	aa	1
What could you use that for	Thinking	aa	1
Does Cameron know know exactly what we should use	No	aa	1
Thats when you  but the problem is how many times does six go into five	Zero	sd	4
Delilah how do we know	By place value	sd	4
Does the question change	No	b	1
The question is what it is right	Yes	b	1
It is we need to figure out how many times six goes into our total as close to it as we can get without going	Over	sd	4
why cant we use that	Because its larger than the dividend and if you try and subtract it from your divided then its going to be a negative	sd	5
Explain it using the marble problem	You would have 135 marbles but you wanted to take away 600	sd	5
You would have 135 marbles but you wanted to take away 600	You cant do that because you dont have 600	sd	5
Jack why cant I do this	Because of the	sd	1
Zach why not	Because its bigger than the dividend	sd	5
What does that mean	We cant multiply it	sd	4
Lacy please restate what Ms  said so that Jack and Zach can hear it and pay attention this time	You cant do 600 because if you only had 135 marbles you couldnt use 600	sd	5
If I tell you to go and clean the windows with a squeegee can you do it	No	b	1
Why not	Because you dont have a squeegee	sd	1
If I tell you to ride your bike down the halls can you do it	No	b	1
Table one what do you think we should start with	I think we should start with six times 5	sd	4
Table two	We did six times 20	sd	4
Table three	6 times 10	sd	4
Table four	Six times	sd	4
Table four	6 times 20	sd	4
How many of you want me to tell you which ones right	Which one	aa	1
Arianna	Its not too big and its not too small	sd	5
Now Lacy do you have that down	Yes	b	1
Can I use that to solve the problem	Yes	b	1
But is it my best choice	No	b	1
Why is it not my best choice	What did you say	sd	1
Why is it not my best choice	Because  and then its kind of hard when youve got a remainder to subtract	sd	5
Same exact problem no tricks but I want to show you that you can have a plethora of choices in which to solve this	60	b	4
What am I multiplying times 6	10	b	4
6 times 10 equals	60	b	4
Youre following Vanessa	Yes	b	1
Youre following Zach	Yes	b	1
Really	Yes	b	1
Do I have a six	Yes	b	1
Do I have a 10	Yes	b	1
Do I have a 60	Yes	b	1
How many bags was I able to make	10	b	4
Ms  what does it tell me	How many marbles are left	sd	4
That are still	In the bucket	sd	4
Is my bucket empty	No	b	1
How did I get seven	You crossed  to five you made it four	sd	5
Why am I not done with the problem	Because you still	sd	1
Isnt that what I was trying to do	No	b	1
What do I still have Roman	You still have 75 marbles	sd	4
Isnt the goal of division to try to divide everything youve got out evenly	Yes	b	1
Ms	You know when your problem is done is when a number is smaller than six like three is smaller than six	sd	5
Because what	Make another group of 10	sd	4
Marcus	Because  by six	sd	4
That as soon as we get a number thats smaller than six were done	Because we dont have enough marbles to fill another bag	sd	5
Zach what are we trying to do in this problem	Trying to	sd	1
Cameron	Were trying to accomplish how many bags	sd	4
Lynn what are we trying to accomplish	We are trying to accomplish how many marbles fit in that bag	sd	4
What are we trying to figure out here Lacy	Were trying to figure out what our portions is	sd	4
Were trying to figure out what our portions is	Were trying to figure out how much bags we can make	sd	4
If the question is asking how many full bags of marbles we will have do we care about the three that are leftover	No	b	1
Did you when I first taught it to you	No	b	1
We try to start filling up more bags because we know we still have how many marbles left to go Lydia		b	1
Go ahead	We multiply by 10 again	sd	4
We multiply by 10 again	We can	sd	1
We go back to our	Thinking	sd	1
Do we need to write anything else on the thinking box	No	b	1
No we can do this one again can we	Yes	b	1
60 is less than 75 right Jack	Yes	b	1
What are you waiting for	I dont know	sd	1
What	Please may I go to the bathroom	sd	1
Lynn	We have to subtract 75 from 60	sd	4
You mean 60 from 75	Yes	b	1
Will why are we subtracting 60 from 75	Because were taking 60 marbles out of the bucket and putting them into groups of 6	sd	5
When we subtract were trying to figure out	How many	sd	4
Are we done	No	b	1
Brian	Because we can still have more in the bag	sd	5
Now we go back to our	Thinking box	sd	4
Six times two which is	12	b	4
Whats six times three	18	b	4
Lets use that one	No	b	1
What do you mean no	Because its over 15	sd	5
Do I have 18 marbles	No	b	1
What goes on the inside	12	b	4
Arianna	Three	sd	4
15 takeaway 12	Is three	sd	4
Are we done	Yes	b	1
Brielle how do we know were done	We knew were done because	sd	1
Because three marbles left can we fill up another bag of six	No	b	1
10 plus 10 plus two is	22	b	4
How many marbles do we have leftover	Three	sd	4
Three but how many marbles do we need in order to make a full bag	12	b	4
Now some of you most of you hopefully realize at this point that this is the same thing as	12	b	4
Were going to do 6 times 10 because we know 60 works right	Yes	b	1
Whats six times two	12	b	4
Six times 20 is	120	b	4
Can we do that one	Yes	b	1
Class whats six times three	18	b	4
Add a zero	180	b	4
With this one what do I know	That you cant do it because its bigger than	sd	5
Could we do this one	Yes	b	1
Could we do six times one	Yes	b	1
Can we do it again	Yes	b	1
Are we done	Yes	b	1
Which one of these two is better	Both	sd	4
Yes Emily	What happened with	sd	3
What happened with	What happened Does it really have to be from the divisor	sd	4
I dont know what youre talking about	Like you have	sd	1
We want two bags how many marbles are we putting in	3	b	4
Two bags	12	b	4
Lynn	Can we use either one	sd	1
Yes Katie	When we are doing the more easier because if we dont want to  when You know how you did 15 and we did	sd	4
Down here	Yes	b	1
Yes	Do we have to find another multiple to multiply it again	sd	4
Do you see how once we got to 15 we did it two different ways	Yes	b	1
Either one of those works Brian	Do we always have to write the remainder as a fraction	sd	4
Is this the right answer	No	b	1
We dont care about those three extra marbles but if it said how many bags would we need to put all of the marbles in what would my answer be	23	b	4
What	You cant write like R then put the number that you have for the remainder	sd	4
Lets get about 10 minutes in here and lets see what we can figure out	May I go to the restroom	sd	1
Three minutes	Wait I have a question	sd	3
Wait I have a question	Do we use this the dividend	sd	4
Do we use this the dividend	Or do we use the	sd	4
The answer is yes always because the divisor tells us either how many groups were going to have or how many per group we have right	Yes	b	1
Did everybody hear that	Yes	b	1
Gavin what did I just say	Use	sd	1
Without that number you cant do a thinking box	You cant do it backwards like	sd	4
No your first number is always your divisor	Always your divisor okay	aa	1
Jack what did I just say	You said that your divisor is always your first number in your thinking box	sv	1
Gavin what did I just say	That your divisor is always your first number in your	sd	1
What did I say Roman	The divisor	sd	1
Is always	is always	sd	1
the first number where	The first number in your thinking box	sd	4
Now are you all going to have the same number over here	No	b	1
Arianna	Because if you do 5 x 100 you get 500 and 500 is bigger than 260	sd	5
You can do 5 x 30 if you want to	Ill do that	sd	1
You can start there but if youre not good at your multiplication facts what should you start with	10	b	4
Why not	Because you need to fill in another bag	sd	5
This time Im going to take my divisor 5 and what should I multiply it by to get me a number of less than 16 but close to it	13	b	4
5x13	Thats 150	ba	4
5x3 why did you pick 5x3	Because 15 is the closest number I could get with the 5	sd	5
Am I done	No	b	1
Whats 403	43	b	4
Ms Emily what is our question	Is the fraction	sd	1
Is what	If we put the remainder as a fraction	sd	4
Guess what your homework is tonight	This	sd	1
This	Do we have to study	sd	1
Have we done this before	Yes	b	1
Yes	Yes	b	2
Im not going to get smaller am I	no	b	1
If I go left Im getting	smaller	sd	4
Not 250  100 or 200Okay this is just telling you round up or down when the units are less than five round down when your units are higher than five round up	You cant do that	sd	4
You said I cant we cant do that	I said we cant do the	sd	1
I first have to make sure you wrote the number down correctly	Wait show it to you	sd	1
So your number should be 917 point		b	4
Circle the digit in the hundreds place	Wait TOH	sd	4
hundreths	What what are we supposed to do	sd	3
THS	Can I go to the bathroom after Im done	sd	1
Everybody should have circled by what	Zero	sd	4
An x	Ms Strathom	sd	1
Oh Why is it	Because	sd	1
Because	Like hello Im right here	sd	1
Where should your X have been	The 1	sd	4
Solve problems 1 and 2	Wait what page	sd	1
Wait what page	143 problems one and  two	sd	1
143 problems one and  two	123 problems one and two	sd	1
123 problems one and two	Do you want us to do the math lesson or	sd	1
What	I  But you should only have done one and two not this one	sd	1
I  But you should only have done one and two not this one	But you told us to do this I thought you meant this page and	sv	1
What do my  denominators have to be	equal	b	4
How do I say that	28 hundredths	sd	4
So explain to me youre thinking up here	So what I did was I shaded these two columns	sd	4
Alright because thats to what	Tenths	sd	4
Okay	Then I shaded these eight hundredths and	sd	4
Austin go ahead	So I put  So the question is is 28 hundredths closer to two tenths or three tenths	sd	4
So I put  So the question is is 28 hundredths closer to two tenths or three tenths	Three tenths	sd	4
Use the grid to help you decide	I put three tenths because eight is closer to um wait	sd	5
it is closer to what	Um three	sd	4
Zero or 10		b	4
Okay	And then I knew it was three tenths	sd	4
Am I closer to three or am I closer to two	Ten	sd	4
Ten	Three	sd	2
Or am I closer to my 100 Point here		b	4
		b	2
Does that make sense	Yes	b	1
How many		b	4
		b	2
My tallies were not very good	You didnt put	sd	1
You didnt put	You could have split into four	sd	4
Walk me through this	So if youre	aa	1
Youre doing the first one right	Yes	b	1
Yes	If theres 619	sd	4
619 what	Hundredths	sd	4
Thank you	And you shade them six 12 times because theres six in the 10ths place	sd	5
Okay	so then you Do one square because theres 1 hundredth and then do 9 of these little ones because theres 9 thousandths	sd	5
When everyones done Im going to ask you to explain your thinking on 5 A	Okay	b	1
So what would it be between	Zero and 2	sd	4
Well those zero and two I think it wants you to do the between one and two	Okay	b	1
If I raise it to the nearest 100th whats it going to go up to	Yes	b	1
Yes	Two	sd	4
Okay so if I do that whats my number going to be between	2	sd	4
2	3	b	4
What it is right there	again	sd	1
As soon as I come over here	How	sd	1
Am I gonna color nine of these or nine little ones	nine little ones	sd	4
Mhm  just 10 of the little ones	Oh ok	ba	1
What number is directly in between this		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
		b	2
So 15	3 point 615ths	sd	4
3 point 615ths	Yeah and 615 thousand	sd	2
Yeah and 615 thousand	Okay	b	1
Okay	All right	aa	1
And then youre going to round this to the nearest hundreds	What would you like us to do when were done	sd	1
I need to see the answer	Okay	b	1
You dont need to put the zero	Okay	b	1
You two are going to turn your desk	I need help on this	sd	3
So what is your new number if you round it to the nearest hundred Whats your number going to be	200 I think	sv	4
200 I think	No one because its not	sd	1
Remember	Yeah	b	1
What is my new number going to be	I dont get this	sd	3
I dont get this	3 and 62 hundreds	sd	4
And you are starting	So Ill do odd numbers	sd	1
So Ill do odd numbers	Okay so those its be more	sd	1
One would be down here	So do you see how its closer because its past   One one two one three one four whats going to be directly in the middle	sd	5
So do you see how its closer because its past   One one two one three one four whats going to be directly in the middle	And then if we got 36196 We rounded	sd	5
And then if we got 36196 We rounded	Oh Yeah	b	2
Oh Yeah	It just happened again	sd	1
It just happened again	What are the flashing lights	sd	1
What are the flashing lights	Its the lights turned off and back on	sd	1
Its the lights turned off and back on	Its the camera theyre taking pictures outside	sd	1
Its the camera theyre taking pictures outside	Oh I thought it was lightening or something	sd	1
Oh I thought it was lightening or something	You can do your number one	sd	1
You can do your number one	I would like you to work with Izzy please	sv	1
I would like you to work with Izzy please	So where would I start it at	sd	3
So where would I start it at	3	b	4
3	or	b	1
3 point 6 9		b	1
Okay is that number five or more	Yes	b	1
So whats that one going to be called	Tens	sd	4
So whats my new number	200	b	4
read it to me	3 and 6 hundreds	sd	4
So if I know my number has to get to three and 62 hundreds	It would be two point	sd	4
It would be two point	I know In between the middle and the three	sd	4
In order for me to get	Okay	b	1
Which is for what number	One half	sd	4
Whats half way	Half	aa	1
Half		b	4
Okay how many of you are struggling on the number one	Nope	sd	1
One five	It wouldnt round up	sd	4
because my thumbs	K wait	sd	1
K wait	4 point 25 4	sd	4
4 point 25 4	Itd be a little bit past itd be a little bit past 400	sd	4
Itd be a little bit past itd be a little bit past 400	so 425	sd	4
Okay	Okay	b	1
What do you think Addison	Three dogs and two cats	sd	4
What am I adding together Ave	Three plus two	sd	4
Five what	Five pets in all	sd	4
Are dogs pets	Yes	b	1
Are cats pets	Yes	b	1
Aiden what else could	It could also equal six because times	sd	4
Oh but Im doing three dogs plus two cats so if Im asking how many animals or	Theyre animals	sd	4
It could be animals	Animals	b	4
If I were to throw a gerbil up on the screen and ask how many animals are there could you include a gerbil into that	Yes	b	1
What if I throw a pencil	No	b	1
No	Its not an animal	sd	4
It wouldnt have that same thing in common	These are the same things	sd	4
What do you mean by that	I was thinking about the things	sd	1
Lance what do dogs and cats have four of	Four legs	sd	4
Addisona	The snake will eat the fish	sd	5
Cant I add three fish to one snake	They will kill him	sd	5
They will kill him	Theyre not the same denominator	sd	5
It doesnt work	Also the snakes are reptiles and the fish are not	sd	4
Its hiding	A little box	sd	1
Do these two numbers have the same denominator	No	b	1
Do they have the same numerator	No	b	1
Can I compare them that way	No	b	1
Meghan	Four and three	sd	4
Emilio whats the first multiple of four	First multiple of four is	sd	4
Lance	Eight	sd	4
Cory whats the next one		b	4
Six	Teen	sd	4
Larry whats the last one		b	4
First of all do I see any numbers in common already	Yes	b	1
Addison what do you see	I see 12 and 12	sd	4
This number do we have to change at all	No	b	1
Why dont we have to touch that one	I forgot	sd	1
I forgot	If add 10 divided by the denominator	sd	4
This ones already 12 so I dont have to change that one at all but do I have to change this one	Yes	b	1
What did I do to this four to turn it into 12	I dont know	sd	1
I dont know	Teach us again	sd	1
How do I turn four into 12	Multiply	sd	4
How many times did we count by four to get to 12	Three	sd	4
How did we turn four into 12 Karina	43	b	4
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	sd	4
13 is	Three	sd	4
Now is it easier to compare 312 and 212	Yes	b	1
Which ones bigger	312	b	4
Work on this with your table group	Okay	b	1
Okay	I need to do that then you can	sd	1
Lance what did you do next	Im putting the multiples of five and Im seeing if one of them matches and this 10 matches with this one	sd	4
Im putting the multiples of five and Im seeing if one of them matches and this 10 matches with this one	I need to	sd	1
Lois whatre you finding	Im doing this part of the 35 and 710 and I cant really understand	sd	3
I wonder can you compare these two fractions to each other	No	b	1
No	Because I  Three six nine	sd	5
Because I  Three six nine	It just skips the seven	sd	5
It just skips the seven	Probably 710	sd	5
Your two shapes	Yes	b	1
Which one is going to give you more	That one	sd	4
Can we change one of our denominators	Yes	b	1
Lance can you come up and can you do this	Yes	b	1
You want to rub here	Yes	b	1
Lance explain to us what youre doing	First Im going to write the multiples and see if one is the same	sd	5
First Im going to write the multiples and see if one is the same	If you do 52 you get 10 then you bring this one down here	sd	5
If you do 52 you get 10 then you bring this one down here	It took us two times to do it so were going to do 32 and 326	sd	5
Can you say it louder	Whatever I do to the top I have to do to the bottom	sd	5
Whatever I do to the top I have to do to the bottom	I do to the bottom and times 210 and then 610 and 710 and sevens greater than six so this one	sd	5
Im going to give you one more since Miss Evans isnt in here	We havent read  yet today	sd	1

Are you going to be able to handler having a Emmitter	Yes	b	1
Yes	Wait	sd	1
Wait	What are we doing again	sd	1
Emanual what did you write	Four and nine tenths	sd	4
Do we agree	Yes	b	2
When you re done flip your board over so I can tell who s still working	Its popping	sd	1
Rebecca what did you write	I wrote eightyfour and three tenths	sd	4
You are going to do these two problems with your kneetoknee partner talk it through	Four hundredths	aa	4
Four hundredths	Nine hundred	sd	4
Nine hundred	Then twentyseven and fiftyone hundredths	sd	4
Then twentyseven and fiftyone hundredths	This is like a long one	sd	1
That second one is a long one	I didn t have enough room	sd	1
I didn t have enough room	So I had to do this	sd	1
Everyone show Jules active listening	For number one I did For number one I look at the number 12 and 84 hundredths	sd	5
For number one I did For number one I look at the number 12 and 84 hundredths	So I wrote out twelve and eightyfour hundredths	sd	5
The bigger number	Number two I did nine hundred twentyseven and fiftyone hundredths	sd	4
Emmitt	I m not sure but it could be where the decimal is tenths	sd	4
I m not sure but it could be where the decimal is tenths	Then the tenth place after the decimals	sd	4
Then the tenth place after the decimals	The tenths place	sd	4
The tenths place	With writing it you might get those mixed up	sd	4
There s three letters that you need to make sure you add	The THS	sd	4
We re going to read it in three two one	I can solve problems involving the subtraction of fractions and mixed numbers	sd	1
One two three	I can solve problems involving the subtraction of fractions and mixed numbers	sd	1
What are we really looking at today Francis	Subtraction of fractions and mixed numbers	sd	4
Sandra	Including the denominator to the same denominators	sd	4
Three two one	I will know Im successful when I can use drawings or fractions circle pieces to solve problems 25 on page 164	sd	1
Hunter	To show our work	sd	4
Sandra	Maybe to understand	sd	4
Camella can you read that sentence	Solve problems 1 and 2	sd	1
Solve problems 1 and 2	Discuss with your partner how the problems were similar and difficult	sd	1
Can you go to  desk since she s not here	Yes	b	1
Francis clip up	Number 2 is not the same	sd	1
163	Oh yes	b	1
Oh yes	Number 2 is a little different	sd	1
Number 2 is a little different	It s like 3	sd	1
It s like 3	Its 2 3	sd	1
You re going to just estimate what you think the benchmark fraction it will be closest to	Wait	sd	1
Wait	I found that problem is for number 5	sd	1
What should you be doing with problems 1 and 2 as well as solving them	Drawing a picture	sd	4
Gerald	One thing I noticed is I saw that on the first problem the whole You were subtracting four from one and that equals three	sd	5
One thing I noticed is I saw that on the first problem the whole You were subtracting four from one and that equals three	Then for the top fraction for number two is three	sd	5
Then for the top fraction for number two is three	I was subtracting another whole again	sd	5
Whitney what was your estimate for number 2	For number 2 I did 32 1	sd	5
So 1 was your estimate	Yes	b	1
Sandra	I did 311 2 and I did equals 21 2	sd	5
I see Emanual can you say what you wrote for your estimate	I did a little less than 2	sd	4
Camella what was you answer for number 1	It was 33 5	sd	4
Of course I drew Geralds name and then I drew Camella s name	Number 2	b	1
Number 2	I stopped working on that because I didn t read it right	sd	1
Okay Felix	12 3	b	4
Gordon	That we didn t really have to do that much work	sd	4
What step did we not have to do Emmitt	We didn t have to find the common denominator because both have the same denominator	sd	5
Astrid	You had to have borrowed from one of the wholes	sd	4
Rebecca	31 322 3	b	4
31 321 3 right	11 3	b	4
Francis what do you notice about problem 4	It s	sd	1
What do we need to find first	The common denominator	sd	4
Go	I think the estimate would be almost 1  10	sd	5
I think the estimate would be almost 1  10	Yes	b	2
Yes	Thanks	b	1
Thanks	Because 9  8 is 1	sd	5
Because 9  8 is 1	Thats 110	ba	5
Thats 110	Let me just draw up a quick picture	sd	1
You need to check your work	I have to make a picture	sd	1
I have to make a picture	Let me draw a picture	sd	1
Let me draw a picture	910 is close to 1	sd	5
910 is close to 1	So 1 and then 810 is close to 1 too	sd	5
Edwin so I see your partner is confused how we got to borrow in this problem and they even look a little confused on how to  this one	If you borrow	aa	4
Veronica what was the answer for number 3	110	b	4
Gerald can you explain your picture	My picture was I did tenths and I put 910 and then I put a subtraction sign and then I shaded in 810 and then I did the equal sign and then shaded in 110	sd	5
What was the step we did not have to do that we always enjoy when we don t have to do it	Either finding the common denominator or having to borrow	sd	4
Whitney	What I did was I took 3 4 and I multiply it by 3	sd	4
What I did was I took 3 4 and I multiply it by 3	Because the bottom will make 12	sd	5
Because the bottom will make 12	I took 1 3 and also multiply it by 4	sd	5
What strategy did you use	Multiplication	aa	4
Multiplying the	Denominator	aa	4
What was your common denominator	It was 12	sd	4
You said you multiply this fraction by 3 and then this one by	4	b	4
Were going to try it again	I don t know the answer	sd	1
I don t know the answer	You have to round it up	sd	4
You have to round it up	Do you know how to do that	sd	1
Do you know how to do that	Wait	sd	1
Wait	So you got	sd	1
What are your two whole numbers that you see	You have to round up or run down	sd	4
He s really trying to explain it to you	Did you add the fractions that you have	sd	1
Did you add the fractions that you have	Because Im subtracting	sd	4
Because Im subtracting	You got to take away the whole to get 2	sd	5
You got to take away the whole to get 2	Im going to add 3	sd	5
Im going to add 3	Then you have to  6	sd	5
Then you have to  6	Thats what goes in	sd	5
Thats what goes in	3 x 2 is 6	sd	5
82 why	Three is 5	sd	5
Three is 5	Then 2  1 is 1	sd	5
You can just write two	So the estimate is pretty much just that	sd	4
Good	3  8	b	4
Yes so multiply top and bottom by 2	Im just going to do 6 and 6 and 12	sd	4
Im just going to do 6 and 6 and 12	Thats pretty close	sd	1
Put a 3 and 26	Do you need some help Grant	sd	1
Do you need some help Grant	Yes	b	1
1 x 2 is	1 x 2 is	sd	1
Yes then 3 x 2 is	Can I go to the restroom  down there	sd	1
Hey friends I see you dont have a picture	By taking away 1 whole from 10 and adding that on	sd	5
Classity class	Yessity yes	b	1
Make sure youre staying focused	The second one you do the same thing	sd	4
The second one you do the same thing	Its 1 2 x 3	sd	4
Its 1 2 x 3	Do I have to draw pictures	sd	1
Yes youre right	I dont want to draw the picture	sd	1
Good	You have a microphone	sd	1
Classy classy	Yessy yessy	aa	1
Can everyone see this color okay	Yes	b	1
What is my common denominator Adaline	6	b	4
So 3 times what is 6	2	b	4
Charlie what is 31 3 become	31 3 becomes 3 and 26	sd	4
Sandra	It becomes 1 and 36	sd	4
Francis now can I subtract	Yes	b	1
Yes	No	b	1
Why cant I subtract	Wait let me check my paper work	sd	1
Wait let me check my paper work	Because you have to round	sd	5
Its not round	Carry	aa	4
Carry	Borrow	aa	4
Astrid	Now you add on You do 2  6	qy	4
Why plus 6	Because youre adding on the whole	sd	5
What is 2  6	8	b	4
Can I subtract now	Yes	b	1
What is 2  1	1	b	4
8  3	5	b	4
You shouldve had 1 and 56	Yes	b	1
Sandra	We didnt notice that you had to borrow so we noticed that we cant take 2 away from 6 and 3	sd	5
Whats my first step	Find the common denominator	sd	4
How did you find the common denominator	I just multiplied it by the 5 and 3 together	sd	4
Multiplied the 5 and 3 together and got	15	b	4
Gordon	Our new fractions are 315 and 1015	sd	4
Our new fractions are 315 and 1015	Is it right	aa	1
I cant hear you	Borrow	aa	4
Camella	115	b	4
3  15 is	18	b	4
Now can we subtract	Yes	b	1
Class	5	b	4

Solve this problem	I dont want to do it	sd	1
I dont want to do it	I dont want to do it	sd	1
Make sure you copy down the problem correctly	Was that homework	sd	1
It mightve been	Im pretty sure	sd	1
Maybe where I got it from	Which pages do we do	sd	1
Which pages do we do	Ms	b	1
What	What pages do we do	sd	1
142 and 143	42	b	1
Can you change my pages to 164 and 166	What about 165	sd	1
164 and 165	Ill just do every page	sd	1
Ill just do every page	Its only	sd	1
Thank you	I cant reduce it	sd	4
I cant reduce it	I got my answer right there and its also over there	sd	1
Work anyway	Going there thinking about it saying that Knowing that  thinking that it would happen and then  My dad says it would really  me because it shows me	sd	1
Will it matter in 10 years	Wait was it addition or subtraction	sd	3
Wait was it addition or subtraction	Subtraction	aa	4
I want to hear mouths talking	This is how you say six in German how do you pronounce that	sd	1
What is our common denominator	10	b	4
Lets do our new Lets write out our new fractions 9 and what	6 and 13	sd	4
Now I have to add what to four	10	b	4
Because remember thats our what	5 and 13	sd	4
4  10 is	Only a 4 its not	sd	1
Only a 4 its not	5	b	4
14  5	11	b	4
11	I mean 10 9	sd	4
I mean 10 9	9	b	4
Good job	Ms  what pages do we do	sd	1
Classy classy	Yessy yessy	aa	1
What is the most difficult part of subtracting fractions	Borrowing	sd	4
Gerald	What is it	sd	1
What is it	Finding a common denominator	sd	4
Does anyone find drawing maybe difficult	Yes	b	1
Wave bye	Bye	aa	1
All right Matty give me a term that we used when we were talking about enlarging something	is that something is getting bigger	sd	4
Phone a friend	Two times as tall or two times as large	sd	4
Kayla what did we create	A diagram	sd	4
We had to come up with something before we could create the diagram	A picture	sd	4
Georgia	Usually  is two times as bigger and usually the size of our folders	sd	4
Did that necessarily mean that your enlargement was incorrect	No	b	1
Kind of like if Im going to buy pizza for the class Im not going to buy one pizza am I	No	b	1
Clay what does it mean to revise	To restart or change	sd	4
Do you guys have four	We only have two	sd	1
You dont have a partner	We have four	sd	1
We have four	We already have four	sd	1
Okay so everybody has a group of at least three people	Yes	b	1
You didnt get it drawn	No	b	1
Did they successfully enlarge it	No	b	1
They followed the rule	Yes	b	1
Franc what did you disagree with what I said	I disagreed with it because when you said	sd	2
Did you agree with or disagree with that they used the same coordinates	I disagreed	sd	2
Why did you disagree	Because they didnt use the same coordinates otherwise if they did itd be in the	sd	5
It would be in the what	The corner	sd	4
They actually came up with different coordinates	Its still the same one	sd	2
Yes Stella would you like to add something to that	Yes that I think the coordinates are	sv	2
Yes that I think the coordinates are	Not when its five and nine	sd	2
Not when its five and nine	Thats five and the other one is more than five	sd	2
Thats five and the other one is more than five	That theyre different sizes	sd	2
Okay so if we go back and look Stella	I think itll go to 10 wouldnt it	sd	4
Six and eight is that two	Yes	b	1
Did they enlarge it	No	b	1
No its the exact same isnt it	Yes	b	1
Could I have changed the coordinates to enlarge the book	Yes	b	1
Would it have been easier or harder	Harder	sd	4
Why would it have been harder Finn	What	ba	1
What	To do what	sd	3
To change the coordinates this way	Because then you have to figure out where it is from zero and two then you have to figure out where youre going to put it on the grid to start it off and then you have to do what you do	sd	5
Because then you have to figure out where it is from zero and two then you have to figure out where youre going to put it on the grid to start it off and then you have to do what you do	It says right there you just redraw it then try and redraw it as you can	sd	5
Okay so is it easier to create a rule when enlarging something using the original coordinates and just doubling them or tripling them or quadrupling them	Yes	b	1
No youre going to get to think about it	I cant even see	sd	1
They asked you to create a rule that enlarged it and this person said	Thats student Bs work	ba	4
This is student Bs work right	Yes	b	1
Are we talking about the same thing	No	b	1
All right so new book he multiplied the X coordinate by six so lets look 62		b	4
06	Zero	sd	4
Look what he did here	He needed to add the one coordinate to what it was up there	sd	2
All hes telling me is that hes multiplying the X coordinate by six and in the second one the original book was 01 and in his it was 06	We can too 01	sd	2
Jenn tell me what he did	He said you will only multiply the X coordinate but he did the Y coordinate	sd	2
He multiplied that Y coordinate by six didnt he	Yes	b	2
Look at what he did here and did he do it all the way down	Yes	b	2
So his coordinates he did not follow his rule did he	No	b	2
Okay but hes got this book here	Thats huge	ba	1
His books doing the work	Its not big enough	sd	4
Then hes got 030	All the way up there	sd	1
Im not sure hes got a book here doesnt he	Yes	b	2
It looks bigger	Really big	sd	1
MIssy explain to me why his book worked	It worked because he doubled the X coordinates and Y coordinates	sd	5
Did he double	No	b	2
Im going to ask you to phone a friend in your group to help you continue explaining	He timesed it by six to make it bigger both ways instead of it being taller because he started going too taller but then its a normalsized book because he timesed it by six	sd	5
Because he did both it made it taller and	Wider	sd	4
Number C or student C it was corrected it taller	He was correct it got taller	sd	2
He was correct it got taller	I dont think he understand the problem	sd	2
Im going to ask you did you all do anything wrong yesterday	No	b	1
No	No we follow the rules	sd	4
No we follow the rules	We made it bigger	sd	4
We made it bigger	We followed the rule	sd	2
We followed the rule	We followed the rule we just didnt get is as	sd	2
Okay so you followed the rule	Yes	b	1
Did you enlarge it	Yes	b	1
Did you meet the objective	Yes	b	1
Now did it fit on a folder or did it look like an ant on that folder	It looked like an ant on that folder	sd	5
So if you have a twin bed a number one if you have a double bed a two if you have a queen bed a three if you have a king or California king give me a four	I have number one	sd	1
I have number one	I have a two	sd	1
Some of you have twin beds	I have a twin bed	sd	1
If I have to arrange my bed on this rug is it going to be easier for me to arrange my twinbed and dresser or my queen or doublebed and dresser	Twin	sd	4
Twin	Because its smaller	sd	5
If I am designing a mural	What is a mural	sd	1
Am I going to be able to paint the same sized mural here that I can on that back wall	No	b	1
Do I have windows on this side	No	b	1
Do I have as many cabinets on this side	No	b	1
How come I could not Bruce	Because the house number it goes to is four or the coordinates that you have to meet is four so you have to do 410 and thatll be 40 and it doesnt go up to 40	sd	5
Okay yes maam	What is wrong with that 127	sd	3
Like Stella youre saying we didnt get ours done is what youre telling me right	Yes	b	1
They dont all need to be the exact same you could try it in different sizes	Would we write our new rule on this paper	sd	1
No how do we write our new rules	Color	sd	1
Youve got the back of the paper okay	Okay	b	1
Youre going to need to move yours too because you cant have it	Me	sd	1
Okay you have these out and begin working again	Are we working on the same thing	sd	2
Let me see	Because I picked the skin on it	sd	1
Remove your fingers and I want you to stop eating your finger	No Im not talking to you	sd	1
No Im not talking to you	Im talking to Matty	sd	1
Why cant you	Because they	sd	1
Take your maths books out and work on some maths for a few minutes okay	Okay	b	1
Okay	Okay so were going to have to multiply by six	sd	5
Okay so were going to have to multiply by six	Okay so were going to multiply X and Y	sd	4
Okay so were going to multiply X and Y	2x6	b	4
Are you doubling	12 and then 0 and then 0x6 so 0	sd	5
I want to see what you did	Im on	sd	4
Im on	No Im on	sd	4
No Im on	So zero and then 30	sd	4
There you go	No we still do this	sd	4
No we still do this	We still do that one because we have to go from that to there so we dont cross that one out	sd	5
Youre using a colored pencil so thats okay	Im sure because 6x1 is 6	sd	5
Im sure because 6x1 is 6	Yes Im on	sd	4
Thank you	Then 6x53	sd	5
Then 6x53	No that is there	sv	2
No that is there	Sorry I know we have it right there	sd	2
Sorry I know we have it right there	We all make mistakes	sd	2
X only by five and what do you think the outcome is going to be	Its going to be wider	sd	4
Okay Matty good job	Then 0 all the way up to 30 up there and then six	sd	5
Where is the six	The down one	sd	4
Where would  be	Okay now its	sd	4
So why are you putting the Y first	Just skip that one	sd	1
Just skip that one	skip that	aa	1
You put the Y first then	Skip that	aa	1
Skip that	No were supposed to connect them	sd	2
Make sure okay	You crawl before you walk or you walk before you climb	sd	4
You walk before you climb	Or you crawl before you walk	sd	4
Nice job you revised your writing	Yes	b	1
Turn your revised work into Wednesdays basket	Were you looking for your pen	sd	1
Show me when its done and then you may go back to play your game	Were getting pictures	sd	1
Okay so what is question one and two	Why its wide as it is high	sd	1
Is that really 35	Not exactly	aa	4
Because its only half	Its only supposed to be a little bit	sd	4
Your design needed to be smaller	Smaller	sd	1
Im asking the question did you look at the size here	No	b	1
Should you have listened to what Ricky was saying in the first place when he said you dont have enough	He didnt say that he said that theres no 35 so	sd	2
Only do it six times instead	Do I have to do that	sd	1
As soon as he said we dont have a 35 what should you have said	Its too big	sd	4
All right get those ready to carry on even though you didnt have them	It will be bigger and taller	sd	4
Marcuss going to share out what happened and how his thinking should have changed go	Okay well so I did seven times the Ycoordinate while I only did six for the X because if you did seven for the X then itd be really too large	sd	5
Okay well so I did seven times the Ycoordinate while I only did six for the X because if you did seven for the X then itd be really too large	So I did seven for the Y and found out that it was only half of the square	sd	5
Can I borrow this to show them	Yes it was only half a square	sd	4
This wasnt a full square up here was it	No	b	2
Ricky what did you say the second he said that	I said that theres no 35	sd	2
I asked Marcus now what should that have triggered everyone	That we needed to make it smaller	sd	4
Did we discuss other students work	Yes	b	1
What work did we discuss Jared	We discussed student A B and Cs work	sd	4
Specifically where in school	Math	sd	4
Is that the only time we do it	No	b	1
Okay Bruce	Writing	sd	4
Jenn	Does it have to be at school	sd	1
No when do you revise things in your life	Grocery shopping	sd	4
Grocery shopping why do you revise things grocery shopping	Because if you work there and say it over to pricing and its like last Friday or something you bring that thing down	sd	5
Hudson when do you revise things	At home in my day life	sd	4
Where is your bandaid	On my finger	sd	1
When you said you revise things at home what do you revise at home	I revise by doing my chores and book	sd	4
Hudson use your resources	Something I make changes	sd	4
When do you revise things	When I do my homework at my house and my dad tells me its wrong but I think its right so we change it	sd	4
You have to change it	I revise at home	sd	4
I revise at home	Whenever Im fighting with my brother we have an argument and hell solve it and then after the next time I make a change	sd	4
All right were you able to understand others thinking	Yes	b	1
Specifically Jared said we looked at	A B and C	sd	2
What were we able to determine by looking at their work	If they were right or wrong	sd	4
What else	What they did	sd	4
Im looking for that Rword	They revise	sd	4
