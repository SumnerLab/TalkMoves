Its videotaping me	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	I thought you said itll go around like on the carpet	0.0
It just swivels like this	I dont see it doing that	0.0
Say good morning	Good morning	0.0
Its so good were reviewing this isnt it	I want to revise my thinking	0.0
What do you want to revise your thinking about	Well I said	0.0
Well I said	Right now I just feel like the lines	0.0
Can you remind me your name	Brady	0.0
Will you stand up and tell us something you heard with you and your partner	My partner said that she thinks that theyre both the same	1.0
Tell me what you mean by the same	They both are the same angle	3.0
They both are the same angle	Although ones smaller but theyre still the same and like the same length with the angle	3.0
Although ones smaller but theyre still the same and like the same length with the angle	Theyre both pointed at the same The degree of that	3.0
Whos lucky number 22	Thats me	0.0
Fern would you tell us think about what Brady just said and you may add on	I agree with him because if you like drew  the angles are the same but not the size	1.0
I agree with him because if you like drew  the angles are the same but not the size	It kind of depends on	0.0
You can go point to it	The size is bigger but not the angle	3.0
We would call that a Do we know the math vocabulary for that	Ray	3.0
The rays are smaller in angle A but what about the angle measurement	Theyre the same	3.0
How do you know	Because  traced them	4.0
Because  traced them	I put angle A and angle B and they were the same	4.0
Would you share something that	I agree with	1.0
Tell your class	I agree with Brady and Fern because theyre both the same size but ones just smaller and ones bigger	1.0
I agree with Brady and Fern because theyre both the same size but ones just smaller and ones bigger	Like Brady said the degree matters too	1.0
Like Brady said the degree matters too	I just draw that right here like Ms Miller told us and I put it against the bigger one	4.0
I just draw that right here like Ms Miller told us and I put it against the bigger one	They go the same way and of the same size but theyre not ones smaller and ones bigger	4.0
They go the same way and of the same size but theyre not ones smaller and ones bigger	What Im hearing you say is when we talk about angles being bigger and smaller were not talking about the length of the ray	4.0
You guys know what this little arrows called	Vertex	3.0
Would you like to add on	I said that on the screen he said that he thought angle B was bigger	1.0
I said that on the screen he said that he thought angle B was bigger	We were supposed to write what we want like if we disagree or agree with her	0.0
Do you think angle B is bigger	No	0.0
No	Well I said I agree because the size of B is bigger but I disagree because the angle is the same size and the same type of angle	1.0
Do you want to add one more thing Michael	Yes so at first I agreed with Fern and Brady and Damian said but now Im  because now I remember that the arrows meaning it goes on forever	1.0
Add on to it Colin	One of the rays has an arrow on it	3.0
One of the rays has an arrow on it	It makes it a ray	3.0
Yes	The arrow right here usually goes out throughout and it doesnt stop	3.0
Thank you for clarifying that	Its on both sides so technically theyre the same length	3.0
Probably well youre right	If B stayed and then A grew it would be the same size as B	4.0
Okay ladies and gentlemen would you please take out your light green fraction circles	How many of them	0.0
Purple wedges	Light purple or dark	0.0
Joshwell do you have your fraction circles	No theres	0.0
Or if you dont have it what would be an option for you of where to look or what to do	Probably at the back desk	0.0
That would be a great strategy wouldnt it	How else does a cube look	0.0
Try them out	Ill go with the light purple	0.0
Try it out	Its light purple	0.0
Do you think they mean like it doesnt have to be purple it could be is there another color thats a whole	I think both wedges are	0.0
I want you to try to fit some wedges into the angle and have it fit perfectly	Cant this angle also be called EDC	3.0
It could be	When	0.0
When	I have this one and that one	0.0
I have this one and that one	I have two of them	0.0
Yes now you can probably use that  to help you with the next one	Okay now I have three	0.0
Do other wedges create  measurement	I have four	3.0
So should you touch anyone elses work when you walk by	No	0.0
Should you look at other peoples work when you walk by	Yes	3.0
Whats our answer now	Three	3.0
Brendan	I think they all are because I tried all of those too when I was trying to figure out how many would fit on the second one but then I realized when we came to the carpet that all of these could be whole wedges so I figured that the orange one was one whole because at first I thought just the whole circle like the red one would be the whole because I thought that on the second one it would be four so I thought it would be the yellow one but then I saw Alyssas when she put 13 on hers and then I revised my thinking and thinking that that was one whole because it fit perfectly on there	4.0
Colin would you like to add on	I was thinking	0.0
Its Jack	No Colin	0.0
Tell your classmates	I respectfully disagree with Brendan because if you look on the other questions it says that how would you put the fourth wedge	1.0
I respectfully disagree with Brendan because if you look on the other questions it says that how would you put the fourth wedge	You cant put four wedges on there because that would be	3.0
You cant put four wedges on there because that would be	Yes you can	1.0
Yes you can	Yes you can	1.0
My friends what I want us to think about is we start	Okay but you cant do all of them	0.0
I just love how your brains are thinking so much about this	I respectfully disagree	1.0
Lets look at this on right now	Excuse me	0.0
I think were supposed to have the light purple	I think light purple is	0.0
Do they mean this one	No I think they mean light purple	0.0
About how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle	Thatd be because you can fit 412	4.0
Thatd be because you can fit 412	Yes you can fit 412	1.0
We could fit 412	I think thats what the fourth wedge	3.0
Yes Alyssa	Before I counted out I knew that four times three equals 12 but so then I counted out and it worked out	4.0
Who would be right	All of them	3.0
All of us	Well actually we dont know	0.0
Why	You have different sized feet	3.0
Lets say Paris walked from C to ETwalked from C to E and Ms Miller walked from C to E	unit so youll get different answers because you guys have different sized feet	4.0
Yes why did we get different answers	Because you used feet she used miles and Paris used kilometers	4.0
Yes my dear	Are we supposed to	0.0
We are	I dont agree because I measured them	1.0
You know a way to measure angles	Yes	0.0
You know a way to measure angles	Yes	0.0
Tell us more	Okay I usually use a box and a circle to tell  because equals are very similar to fraction pieces because they can do the outline	4.0
They sure are theyre similar to fraction pieces	I was measuring it with one of the 112 pieces  Id do	4.0
I was measuring it with one of the 112 pieces  Id do	I was thinking it might be a fortyfive degree angle	4.0
Youre starting to think about degrees of angles and that you know that different fraction pieces are different measures	Yes	0.0
Everybody say rotation	Rotation	0.0
My friends today we will explore the word of say it	Rotation	0.0
We will know that we have it when we practice different kinds of turns because turn is another word for what	Rotation	3.0
Youre going to be doing what	Turn	3.0
And	Rotations	3.0
How many degrees Colin this is where I need you how many degrees are in a circle	360	3.0
Are you facing me right now	Yes	0.0
Now if I was measuring that angle that was a full turn angle or Colin how many degrees	360	3.0
We are turning clockwise which hand goes up	Right	3.0
Go	Oh my God its so hard	0.0
Where should you be facing	That way	3.0
That way	The front	3.0
My friends so far we have turned a whole turn we have turned a halfturn and now we are going to turn a	Quarter	3.0
How did you guess	Because we aint dumb	0.0
Because we aint dumb	Because a quarter is half of	4.0
A quarter Eva was that you	Yes	0.0
Say it again	A quarter is half of a half	3.0
A quarter is half of the half	90 degrees	3.0
Or	90 degrees	3.0
Where should you be facing	The whiteboard	3.0

Go	Describe each angle by the amount of rotations	0.0
Describe each angle by the amount of rotations	Use the words full turn threequarters turn halfturn and quarterturn	0.0
Go	Quarter turn	3.0
Quarter turn	Half turn	1.0
Say it out loud	Half turn	3.0
Half turn	Quarter	1.0
Would you stand up for us so we can hear you	I thought it was a quarter turn based on the rotation of how far the angle was and the reason why I think it is a quarter turn is because if you look it looks like its not a full half turn based on how long it is	4.0
My friends remember our sentence starters on the whiteboard	Alyssa	0.0
Alyssa	I think its a halfturn because if you look at the shape of it if you do that shape again I think its a whole square and I think that would be a whole	4.0
Were going to keep hearing from each other	I think its a quarter turn because it mostly depends on the turn like how much you have to turn	4.0
What did we just do	Quarter turn	3.0
Our answer for number one is what	Quarter turn	3.0
Say your answer out loud	Full turn	3.0
Bryce	I said it was a whole turn because if you look at the very bottom of it it shows a whole circle	4.0
What did that tell you	It told me that it was rotating all the way around	3.0
He did a full turn	Its like that earth thing you were doing isnt it	0.0
Okay	the ones that we	0.0
Go	Because if this was ones the quarter and it went like that	3.0

Youre not getting any closer to it though	Youre still going for towards it	3.0
It does tell you about direction	It goes infinitely	3.0
What would the next statement then be Ethan	As X goes towards negative	3.0
As X goes towards negative	Why dont you just say as X decreases Y increases	1.0
Why dont you just say as X decreases Y increases	Thats a specific format for end behavior	1.0

Yes you dont have to solve it	Im still doing it because Im still	0.0
Its not a bad plan	You just subtract these	3.0
You just subtract these	Oh wait	0.0
Oh wait	You guys multiplied the fraction	1.0
You guys multiplied the fraction	Oh because you subtract this	3.0
Oh because you subtract this	Yes you subtract this	1.0
Yes you subtract this	Five to the power of eight	3.0
Five to the power of eight	Its 731	3.0
Its 731	You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	4.0
You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	No wait	0.0
No wait	You can actually solve for that	3.0

Now if I multiply by one am I changing my number	Not necessarily  its getting more specific in terms of	0.0
If I take seven and multiply it times one its still seven right	Yes	0.0
Is it still seven	Yes	0.0
Yes so why are we finding some sort of one to multiply our problem by	To remove the radical from the denominators	3.0
If we focus on what was chosen to multiply this by 8 is 2x2x2 right	Yes	0.0
What kind of root are we taking here	A fifth	3.0
Now the cube root of four	The cube root of four	0.0
What did they end up choosing is going to be the form that we have there	Oh this is  says Its conjugate	0.0
It is conjugates but if I have two things Im multiplying two binomials that Im multiplying one as a plus and one as a minus	Difference of two squares	3.0
Because what happens when we take the square root of three times the square root of three	Three	3.0
Were going to use the difference of two squares as the idea and as Santiago was saying we talk about it being a conjugate	Conjugation	0.0
Notice in this case that my index is the same and my radicand is the same so what did they do here	Three	3.0
Where did that one come from	Its an implied  factoring out a common	3.0
Its an implied  factoring out a common	I think	0.0
Whats a factor of 54	Two	3.0
Twentyseven so its two Oh thats a	Perfect cube	3.0
Now that Ive written things as cubes I can split them up if it helps to think of them that way and we know that if I have a cube root of something thats cubed	It cancels out	3.0
Then the question is why did they put an absolute value thing in there	Its not based on the principal root	3.0
Whats a number that I can take the fourth root of	They can be negative and positive	3.0
Yes if I say I take the fourth root of whats 2x2x2x2	Then you can have minus two and thats	3.0
Then you can have minus two and thats	Plus or minus	3.0
Explain what youre talking about Santiago	For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	4.0
For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	Yes am I not explaining enough	0.0
Yes am I not explaining enough	For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	4.0
For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	When we are typically working with radicals we want to get the principal root which is the positive answer and the absolute bar value is there to strictly involve with principal root	4.0

Did you finish the extra practice	I thought we only had Just kidding were not done at 215	0.0
Joanne whats step one	Isolate the radical on one side of the equation	3.0
For this particular example whats our first step going to be David	Isolate the radical	3.0
Whats it going to take for us to get the radical by itself to divide by	Yes divide by two	3.0
Whats step two Tobias	Get rid of the plus one	3.0
Jill	I can get rid of the radical	3.0
How do we know when we can get rid of the radical Tobias	When theres nothing outside of it and theres no other part of the equation thats like it	3.0
Tobias	Dont you multiply it by itself	3.0
Dont you multiply it by itself	Dont you square it	3.0
Simplifying this Id end up with x1 but then I have this	Its not going to go over	3.0
Yes so have I simplified	No	0.0
In this case what do you think we should do Cordelia	Then we have to solve the resulting equation	3.0
Jason	Square it	3.0
Square it	You raise each side of the equation to the same exponent so then youd square both sides	3.0
Eliza what are we going to do to get x by itself now	You minus one	3.0
Minus one yes so we end up with x equals	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Whats the next step Nadia	Youre done	3.0
Were good	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Joel	You have to substitute the xy back into the	3.0
Now what was step one Joel	Isolate the radical	3.0
When we add one to both sides will we have isolated the radical or are we done with that	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Whats step two	We cube each side	3.0
Whatever we have here and whats 33 going to give us	Twentyseven	3.0
To get x by itself here whats my two steps	Cube each side	3.0
Weve done that were left with this two step equation	Add nine to each side then divide by two	3.0
Perfect now why did you say add nine as the first step instead of dividing by two first	Because otherwise you would still have the nine remaining	4.0
What would 9 2 give me	Four point five	3.0
Can you guys think what is the math reason that we use that says why we add nine first	Order of operations	3.0
Say that again	Order of operations	3.0
Refresh our memory	Its reverse order of operations	3.0
Yes you	I have a question about	2.0
I have a question about	If you add 9 to either side youd be left with 36 then if you divide by 2 you get left with 18 but if you divide it by 2 and 27 then you get	4.0
Yes yes you just simplify	Its not	0.0
Its not	Its not so good	3.0
First three problems on that extra piece of paper you got	Weve probably done the two on that	3.0
Weve probably done the two on that	Is that  equations	3.0
Isolate the radical	Isolated the radical	0.0
Brittany we havent heard much from you so could you read the big paragraph	Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	0.0
Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	C solutions are called x solutions	0.0
C solutions are called x solutions	When you use  you should always check each apparent solution in the original equation	0.0
Could you read that attend to precision	Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	0.0
Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	Consider the equation  x3	0.0
Consider the equation  x3	This equation has no real solution	0.0
This equation has no real solution	However you obtain x9 after squaring each side	0.0
In this particular example Brittany whats step one	Isolate the thing	3.0
Weve isolated the radical so step two then	Get rid of the radical	3.0
Get rid of the radical so in this case we would raise it to	A second power	3.0
A second power and we would end up with x29	Yes	0.0
Yes	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	No x9	3.0
If I plug nine back in here whats  9	Three	3.0
Thats showing us that you dont always get the right answer in these problems and so were going to go through some of those	Technicallycould you just not check it and understand that if its equal to a negative then its not going to have a solution	3.0
Brittany whats step number one	Isolate the radical	3.0
Brittany	Yes	0.0
What do I have to do to isolate the radical here	Its already isolated	3.0
Step two was	Get rid of the radical	3.0
What am I going to do to both sides	Square	3.0
Square both sides	Now were getting spicy	0.0
Why are we getting spicy	Foil	3.0
We have to distribute the	I still dont know the foil is	0.0
Thats okay because foil is	Just one method of it	3.0
Whats going to happen here Brittany	Those cancel out	3.0
What happened between here and here	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	You foiled it	3.0
Ive got one x there and another x there for two over there	table method	3.0
Table method I think is a great way of organizing to multiply those	I agree	0.0
Whats step three of the process	Solve for x	3.0
Joel what are we going to do	Im gonna subtract the 1	3.0
What are you thinking	You could subtract 7x and subtract 15 and just factor your brand new trinomial from there	4.0
I could do that and what would I end up with over here	Zero	3.0
Equals zero	Establishing zero	3.0
What would be left over here is an x2 combining these	A negative I guess	3.0
Combining those	Minus 14	3.0
Are there factors of negative 14 that add up to 7	Yes	0.0
My x values are	Negative two and seven	3.0
Whats the last step Brittany	You solve for x	3.0
We did solve for x	Oh I knew that	0.0
What comes right after that	We plug it back in and check and make sure	3.0
This is that example of an extraneous solution	an example of a headache	0.0
Yes	If I remember it correctly but Im not sure  of the solutions could be correct	3.0
Thankfully this side looks a whole lot less complex	Its really easy to do it	0.0
Now what do you think were going to need to do	Just simplify	3.0
Theres a plus two and a three over here	Also the x	3.0
There is an x and an x over here	You would just subtract in both sides	3.0
Where are we going to put everything Tobias	I would first of all just subtract all the constants so I would subtract two and one in both sides	3.0
What happens over here	Youre getting rid of the entire three because that equals three so you can	4.0
We are simplifying its getting more simple as we go	Then you subtract x from both sides which will get you negative two x	3.0
Then	Then you divide both sides by two	3.0
Divide by two that gets rid of that	That gets you back to negative x and then you just square both sides and then it just gives you x2x2	4.0
Brittany after we isolate the radical what do we do	Yes	0.0
What are we going to do	Factor	3.0
Do I want to subtract all of this or subtract that	Subtract the x in the negative two	3.0
Why would I prefer to move these over here instead of moving that over here	To keep the leading coefficient positive	3.0
Are there factors of negative two that add up to negative one	Yes	0.0
They would be	Negative two or positive one	3.0
In these cases if we have calculators which were not going to have the calculators on the test	Also these arent that hard	0.0
Also these arent that hard	They are only basic equations	3.0
They are only basic equations	Its not complex stuff	0.0
That last one when we solved it even though there were a lot of steps to it there wasnt anything we couldnt do	going to make us graph that by hand	0.0
Describe the translations from the parent function kind of thing	Are we going to have graphs on the level threes	0.0
Im not making the test this time	Is the extraneous answer always going to be when x is negative	3.0
I dont know well look for patterns and see	In looking for patterns it looks like whenever x is negative	4.0
Whats the one answer that works	x2	3.0
Thats the one that worked	could have just waited for the question to be answered	0.0
Thats okay	I have a question	0.0
Yes	Whos making the test	0.0
Brittany whats going to be our first step	Isolate the radical	3.0
We cant if theres two of them	Square	3.0
Yes were going to square both sides	when one is a cube root and one is a square root	3.0
You dont want to do that when	Can we write these on the paper	0.0
You got all of those	Yes	0.0
Have you checked your answers yet	Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	4.0
Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	Im good at math	0.0
Think about it this way if I have negative two x minus two x what would I have	Negative four	3.0
Joel did you all do the problem	Christian Branson can die	0.0
Christian Branson can die	Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	0.0
Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	Im just having a moment right now	0.0
Im just having a moment right now	Okay guys okay	0.0
Vijay lets come back to your seat	I was helping Joel	0.0
Whats step one for this type of problem because we just switched problems	What I would do is to make that into a radical and then write	3.0
Or we could treat is as the fourth root to x cubed	Subtract two	3.0
Subtract two	Isolate it	3.0
Joel	Isolate the exponent	3.0
Matt whats our first step	The first step is to minus two	3.0
On the left side we get an	Eight	3.0
Now what do we do Cordelia	You have to like do the flippy thingy	3.0
The flippy thingy	Where are you making it into the radical	3.0
What are we going to flip	The three fourth thing	3.0
What do we call that when we flip it	I dont know but you flip it	0.0
I dont know but you flip it	Reciprocal	1.0
Reciprocal	Yes reciprocal	0.0
Because three fourth times fourthirds equals	One	3.0
How do you want to think about eight to the fourthirds power	Would it be  fourth root of eight	3.0
Would it be  fourth root of eight	You find the cube root of eight and thats two and then you multiply that by the other exponent	4.0
Last step here Jared	Divide both sides by two	3.0
X is going to equal	Eight	3.0
We have our solution	That is ridiculously simple	0.0
That is ridiculously simple	I have a question	0.0
Yes	Its basically when youre doing the raise each sides of four thirds youre putting the power of the reciprocal of both sides	3.0
Whats our first step Brittany	Well it already is isolated	3.0
What is isolated	The rational exponent so like that	3.0
What are we going to raise both sides to	Two over one	3.0
Two over one just is	Squared	3.0
Were just going to square both sides	Do you have to use brackets or can you use more parentheses	2.0
Typically you see if theres parentheses that use brackets but more parentheses is fine	would use the bigger parentheses	3.0
Joel what are you going to do if I got a quadratic a constant and a linear term	Subtract the x over	3.0
Subtract the x over okay	Then you get 30 equals x	3.0
Then what do I do	Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	3.0
Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	No because thats x squared	1.0
Go ahead	You have to subtract the 30 Im assuming	3.0
If we subtract that then this whole thing is going to equal	Zero	3.0
Are there factors of negative 30 that add up to negative 1	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Five and six	3.0
Which one has to be negative	Negative six	3.0
Joel when we have quadratic constant and linear terms what do we want to do	Factor it	3.0
Were going to go towards factoring but in between what do we want to do	Set it equal to zero	3.0
When we see we have those three different types of terms we want to set it equal to zero we factor so my two possible solutions here are going to be	Positive six and negative five	3.0
Yes	Can we take a break	0.0
Whats two to the third equal	Two times two times two	3.0
Two times two times two equals	Eight	3.0
For example can we take the square root of a negative number	No	0.0
Is that okay	Yes	0.0
Brittany what do we have to do	Divide by three	3.0
Weve got to divide by three so we do that first	Equals four	3.0
Weve got that now and then what are we going to do to both sides	Get rid of the radical	3.0
Four squared is		3.0
We then	Add one	3.0
Add one and so were left with this expression that x can be any values that are less than or equal to 17	I think  does the inequality symbol ever switch because  divided by negative number you have to switch it	4.0
How could I change my original	Multiply with negative	3.0
X is in between what two numbers	1 and 17	3.0
Sure is it already queued up or	No	0.0
No okay	Do exponents switch to inequality	3.0

What kind of intercepts are we talking about	Xintercepts	3.0
That makes it easy then when we want to find our Xintercepts because whats always true about an Xintercept	Y is zero	3.0
Then the Yintercept whats always true about a Yintercept	X is zero	3.0
Not right now but today when we are done	Those two factors are	3.0
Yes sir	How did we make originally it was 10 so what do we do to make that 10	2.0
On the paper is it negative or positive	Negative	3.0
Oh it is negative okay	When we were doing the example yesterday that we took notes on	3.0
Right that was a different problem	Yes	0.0
It just so it happened that both of the C values had a 10	Both the axis have a three	3.0
Yes is that right	Yes	0.0
What do I know about my line of symmetry	Its in the center of those	3.0
If its in the center of those how do I find the center	Average the root	3.0
All right if we know the X value if we know our line of symmetry what do we do then to find the vertex	Plug the X value	3.0
Once I pull this out and put it in front what am I left with	3X2	3.0
Whats quadratic mean	Square	3.0
Say it again	Four points	3.0
Because quad means what	Four	3.0

Whats T stands for	Time	3.0
Time and	Period	3.0
What do we input for this	T	3.0
T so were inputting the number of	Years	3.0
Years and then we find out	The profit	3.0
The A value positive negative or zero	Positive	3.0
You dont sound very convinced	Positive	3.0
Its positive which means my parabola opens up or down	Up	3.0
All right so if it opens up do I have a min or a max	A minimum	3.0
Is my year over there on the Y or is it on the X	X	3.0
That first half of the quadratic formula tells me the X value of that minimum and then if I want to find out what the dollar value is I	Plug in	3.0
Part C	The company made the same yearly profits in 2012	0.0
The company made the same yearly profits in 2012	Estimate the  with this profit	0.0
All right so if P is the same for both of those years when did they make the least profit		3.0
		1.0
Somebody said 2008		3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
When did I make the least	In the between	3.0
That year then is		3.0
All listen up	Are the yearly profit going to be increasing decreasing or constant	0.0
Are the yearly profit going to be increasing decreasing or constant	Explain	0.0
What year are we in today		3.0
So are the profits increasing decreasing or staying constant	Increasing	3.0
Does this keep increasing	Yes	0.0

In your prompt youre given a point and a vertex and even if they dont tell you what type of form to choose if they give us the vertex lets know that we have to pick the vertex form to start with so if I know my vertex is 2 where do those go in here	H and K	3.0
We could find it but does this vertex form half Yintercept as a plugin value	No	0.0
What do I do with X and Y	Add it to X and Y	3.0
Make sure you rewrite the equation with that A value in there	Does it always have to be this where two equal  Yes	3.0

I dont know Id have to look at the likes toolkits you know	Five or six	0.0
The next intercept theyre all synonyms roots zeros Xintercepts all mean the same thing	P and Q are technically just the Xintercepts	3.0
Thats why they say Xintercepts P and Q	When you write the equation on the test if you wrote that one	0.0
Then what do you think were going to do with X and y	Plug them in the equation	3.0
What would you have to do	You unfactor it	3.0
Yes dont be long	I wont be long	0.0
Coaches the answers are up here if you need to check them	Can you plug in the Xintercept if the	3.0
Correct	What is this	0.0
Walk me through what youve got here	Weve plugged in the vertex here to the  then we plugged in the second	3.0
Theres the problem	Do you want to expand it	0.0

Lets read the number	318500	3.0
Why did they have parenthesis	Because they were	0.0
Look at this persons why are they using parentheses	They are writing the multiplication	1.0
Yes theyre showing keep this together keep this together so what do parentheses do	They keep things together	3.0
Are you trying to group this and this	No	0.0
Try this one how do we say the number	07100	3.0
What is that	Two	3.0
Onetenth plus one times	Because you moved that	3.0
Lets say the number	90615000	3.0
Are you trying to group that together	No	0.0
Do you need that	No	0.0
Like if youre doing 9 x 100 youre grouping that  6 x 1 you would be grouping that does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Thats better	I think Ive finished	0.0
So if you have a question youre like This part doesnt make sense to me stay there  That makes sense	Yes	0.0
This is right	No I know this ones right	3.0
This is the tenth to the zero so what should it be	6 x 10 to the 0	3.0
Or should it be 10 to go first	10 the first	0.0
Because you want one zero there right	Yes	0.0
One would be 10 to the 0	10 to the 0	0.0
Yes so it should be 10 to the 0	Youre right	0.0
Yes so that is right do you see why	Yes	0.0
Yes	I was just trying to go for a	0.0
I was just trying to go for a	I had the one there and I was like No	0.0
I had the one there and I was like No	It had to be a zero	3.0
In comes in switch in comes in whats 15 of 10	15 of 10	0.0
So 10 into how many groups	Two	3.0
So 10   5 is	25	3.0
No you multiply or something I dont know what you did	Dividing	3.0
If we have 10 counters and we had to make them into five groups how many would be in each group	Five	3.0
No wheres your	Heres again	0.0
Im confused about the talking	You said talk again	0.0
No does it say that in the directions	You talk about what you know	0.0
This is what we were just doing at the table	I know	0.0
How many groups are we making	Five	3.0
Five so 10   5 is how many	Five	3.0
Youd have five in each group	Two	3.0
Now do you get what to do	Yes	0.0
You divide the big number by the only group youre putting here so 10   5 is	10   5	0.0
Noah	I got two because I drew a fraction circle	3.0
Im confused about that part	but I was confused about what I was going to do so I divided	3.0
How does this work	You see how many groups of five	3.0
How many groups of what	Five	3.0
dividing it by	Four	3.0
Read this with me please	I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	0.0
Lets try that again	That was weird	0.0
That was weird	I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	0.0
Where did Anferny go	Here	0.0
So theyre right here what do I do	You find dividing the number of  for the group of two	3.0
Why five groups	Because youre giving away a group	4.0
Im finding 15	15 of 10	3.0
So if I have 15 how many are in 15	Two	3.0
If you know what 15 is that was two but then you got three of them so 2 x 3	Six	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Yes try this one	15 x 10	3.0
15 of 15 is	Three	3.0
35 of 15 would be	Nine	3.0
Why	Because its three groups	4.0
Miya	Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	4.0
Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	4.0
Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	4.0
Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	4.0
Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	4.0
Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	Then we do 6 x 3 which is 18	4.0
Why are we multiplying it by three	Because the rule is 35 instead of 15 so youd have to multiply it by three	4.0
Felicia	Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	4.0
Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	That means youll have to take the 10 in the first one and the answer was 2 and then you have to multiply it by 3 to get the out of the next one	4.0
Kayla tell us what you were thinking	The problem was all the ends are multiples of five so that way you can easily and mentally divide them by five but you had a number thats not a multiple of five meaning youre going to have a remainder or a fraction	4.0
The problem was all the ends are multiples of five so that way you can easily and mentally divide them by five but you had a number thats not a multiple of five meaning youre going to have a remainder or a fraction	Then we thought it would be hard to then multiply that fraction or the remainder by three	4.0
Do you get it	Yes	0.0
If you find 15 finding 35 is just multiplying it by three right	Yes	0.0
Does your drawing help you to understand this	Yes	0.0
Eyes up at the Ms Carter	So I used rectangles to  because youre shading 15 of the whole which is 10	4.0
So I used rectangles to  because youre shading 15 of the whole which is 10	So I shaded in 15 of it because were finding 15 and we know that its two because	4.0
How do you know thats two	Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2	4.0
Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2	So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	4.0
So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	4.0
Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	Then since theres three twos we want to add them all together and that would be six	4.0
That explains your model right	Yes	0.0
Would that work	Yes	0.0
Is that what were doing	No	0.0
Partner Bs turn to talk first	I get it	0.0
Okay	Now I get it	0.0
Talk with your partner how you found 15	Three	3.0
Do you see why	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes that makes sense now	0.0
And flash	Five	3.0
How did you get five Eli	I got five and I know the multiplication said it is 10	4.0
I got five and I know the multiplication said it is 10	I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50	4.0
I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50	I know that 5 x10  50 and thats why I got five	4.0
Could you do it by dividing too	Yes	0.0
Somebody that did it as division explain their thinking Rowdy	I did 50 divided 10 and I was trying to see how many groups of 10 were in 50 and I know that it is five	4.0
Once you find what 15 is thats like the one but then you have three of them so you multiply those	Timesing the numerator	3.0
What would you do Lexie	The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	4.0
The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	Yes 10th right	4.0
Yes 10th right	So I thought the 50 would be so I had a dividing and multiplying and then once you know that thats five you would multiply it by seven because youre finding 710 so you would have seven fives seven times five is 35	4.0
Why is it three times four Gracey	Three times four because if you have four groups of three yes it would be three times four because	4.0
Talk with your shoulder partner about why thats eight times eight	like and then	0.0
like and then	is eight times eight	3.0
Because theres eight	Yes because	0.0
Emma why is it eight times eight	It will be eight times eight because youre basically taking the two numbers from the problem then multiplying them	4.0
Thats true but why is it eight times eight	Itll also be eight times eight because you have eight stamps and eight rows	4.0
So theres a group of eight eight different times	Yes	0.0
And flash	Me I know	0.0
Go	It will be eight times 12	3.0
It will be eight times 12	12 oranges	3.0
Right	I found a way  and I got back at where its 60	3.0
David	Six times 12	3.0
Why is six bags of oranges with 12 in each bag six times 12	Because there are six bags with 12 oranges in each	4.0
Did I say it wrong	Yes	0.0
Yes	You said	0.0
Talk with your partner about why its 34 times eight	Well	0.0
Did you already talk yet	eight times 34 because	3.0
Why is it represented that way Emma	Its represented that way because you have 34 of one bag that has eight carrots	4.0
Brandon	Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	4.0
Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	4.0
Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	4.0
Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	Well its not the opposite Im just saying its not 10 times 15 its like 15 of 10	4.0
Kaya	Another way to really to visualize it is if youre thinking of one whole and one whole times itself so if youre multiplying one whole by 34 youre then getting 34 of the whole	4.0
Should one person be dominating	No	0.0
If you finish I do have a game	Nine divided by	3.0
Nine divided by	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I guess it will be 23 of whatever like 23 of 12	4.0
So I guess it will be 23 of whatever like 23 of 12	So then weve got to figure out the odd number	4.0
So then weve got to figure out the odd number	We basically do  make it easier so I can explain easier for you	4.0
We basically do  make it easier so I can explain easier for you	13 of 12 and then we just times that by three	4.0
Nice job	13 of six is	3.0
13 of 12 is four but they have 23	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	So four times two would be eight	4.0
You see your fix up there	I think  are erasable	0.0
Yes because you wouldnt be allowed to use it even if it works	Yes	0.0
Keep working together	Three	3.0
If you have six of these heres six whats 13	13 would be	3.0
So whats 13	Two	3.0
Two but you have 23 so that would be	Eight	3.0
So how much is that	Four	3.0
You see why its four	Yes	0.0
So 13 is how many	Three	3.0
So 23 is	Six	3.0
Okay	Were doing all that	0.0
Keep going	How much is	0.0
So	Oh this will be times three	3.0
Two times three is	It would be	0.0
Two times three is	Two times its six	3.0
You found 14 because if you have eight things	Oh so now I have to find 34 Oh okay	3.0
Do you see what your fix up is	Yes	0.0
Whats 14 of eight	14 of eight	0.0
Yes	Two	3.0
So if you know 14 is two what would 34 be	That is multiplication	3.0
Thats what multiplication is finding fraction of	Oh so its kind of the same thing	3.0
Do you see why its still multiplication	Yes	0.0
14 is two so 34 would be	Two	3.0
Not two	Yes two times	3.0
14 is two	It should be two times three	3.0
Because 14 is two but you have 34	Then you got to times it with that	3.0
But you have three of them so	Its six	3.0
Twenty divided by four is	Five	3.0
Whats 14 of 16	Four	3.0
But you have three of them so you have	Twelve	3.0
You got this	Yes	0.0
Whats 14 of eight	14 of eight would be four	3.0
So 2 x 3 is	Six	3.0
So whats 14 of 20	14 of 20 would be six	3.0
14 of 20 would be six	No	1.0
Twenty divided by four is	Twenty divided by four	0.0
Twenty divided by four	Four	3.0
So five is 14 but how many fourths do we have	Three	3.0
Five times three is	Fifteen	3.0
We have  15	Yes exactly	0.0
Does that make sense	Mmhmm	0.0
14 of 16 is	Four	3.0
So then three of those would be	Would be 12	3.0
Twenty is	Now you have	0.0
Therefore	Seven	3.0
So seven times three is	Seven times three is 21	3.0
Does that help	Yes	0.0
Yes	Do you think five and six	3.0
Would you need counters to do them all	No	0.0
You guys having fun	Yes	0.0
Now you need two  Are we in number six	Yes number six	0.0
Yes number six	Maybe Ill	0.0
So three times eight is	Sixteen	3.0
Twentyfour	Twentyfour	0.0
Twentyfour	Yes	0.0
Whats the number	The number we found	0.0
810 times	810 times 30	3.0
There you go like	Was it 30 or 10	2.0
Im going to bring your homework around	Hi my name is Kai	0.0
Ready go	An improper number one for half I got 36	3.0
An improper number one for half I got 36	I have 3 56 and then four is going to be 23	1.0
I have 3 56 and then four is going to be 23	For two thirds I got four eighths	1.0
For two thirds I got four eighths	No I disagree because two times six	1.0
No I disagree because two times six	six it looks	1.0
six it looks	Because three times two is six	4.0
Because three times two is six	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	68 is technically 34 and I rounded that up to a whole because I said a whole minus a half equals a half	4.0
68 is technically 34 and I rounded that up to a whole because I said a whole minus a half equals a half	I agree with	1.0
I agree with	I convert the 12 to 48 and did it and that would be 28	4.0
I convert the 12 to 48 and did it and that would be 28	Either way its halfway between half of them	4.0
Either way its halfway between half of them	3 x 3 is nine	4.0
3 x 3 is nine	3 x 3  9 thats right	1.0
3 x 4  12	Yes 912	3.0
Yes 912	I see what I did there	0.0
I see what I did there	Whatd you get	2.0
Whatd you get		3.0
	About 15	1.0
About 15	I didnt get anywhere for number two	0.0
I didnt get anywhere for number two	Wait what did you guys say for the last one	2.0
Wait what did you guys say for the last one	15 20 and	3.0
I know that 68 is over a half and so a little more than a half take away a half is going to be a little more than zero	Yes	0.0
I wouldnt expect a number with a five is what Im saying	No I was writing something better than	0.0
He said one thing and it says  I noticed	Page 27 83 and 72	0.0
Here	Yes	0.0
Theres your book	Common multiples a common multiple is a number is common multiple of two or more numbers if it is a multiple of each of those numbers	3.0
Why are these bold	Because those are all the common multiples of that	4.0
What does that mean	It is a multiple of each of those numbers because theyre both common and theyre both in the two Theres two of the same numbers in	4.0
Not just same numbers what kind of numbers	6  6 is 12	4.0
6  6 is 12	Thats common	3.0
Thats common	Here its common because	3.0
Can you say that	Multiple	0.0
Isnt 12 a common multiple of four and 12 also	Yes and then	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes examples	4.0
Yes examples	Three and five are factors of 15	3.0
Three and five are factors of 15	15 is the product of three and five	4.0
15 is the product of three and five	Three and five are a factor pair for 15	4.0
Three and five are a factor pair for 15	Counting numbers cant have more than one factor pair	4.0

One and 15 are another factor pair of 15 because 1 x 15  15	To test whether it	0.0
Does that all make sense to you	Yes	0.0
Why are three and five factors of 15	Because five times one equals 3 x 5  15 because five times three Five 10 15	4.0
Because five times one equals 3 x 5  15 because five times three Five 10 15	To test whether a counting number	3.0
To test whether a counting number	If you flip it around then five times three	3.0
Another factor pair one and 15 also	Three times No three is a factor of 15 because three can go into 15	4.0
Evenly	Yes evenly	0.0
Good	Then five can go into 15 evenly	3.0
Im curious	These are the factors	3.0
All the factors of		3.0
I wouldve just started with It says the first six doesnt	No it says all the factors	3.0
Two	Three four	0.0
I wouldve put them probably in order is my point	Were doing them backwards	3.0
Six is seven isnt	Eight is it	3.0
You guys are done	Yes	0.0
Try some different once	Weve done one and two	0.0
Weve done one and two	Try	0.0
Youre trying to decide if three is a factor of 36	I know	0.0
I know	Right now Im saying yes because theres 30 and six divided by three is	4.0
Right now Im saying yes because theres 30 and six divided by three is	Two	1.0
Two	Yes and because three goes into 36	1.0
Yes and because three goes into 36	Im smart	0.0
Im smart	Then you just go in	0.0
Yes because you know that three goes into 30 10 times	13	3.0
Three goes into six twice	Three and 13	3.0
Three and 13	What about four	2.0
Four times what equals 36	Four times eight	3.0
Four times eight	Close	1.0
Close	Thats 32	3.0
Thats 32	I meant nine	1.0
Four What times 10 is what		3.0
Take four away	Five will get you two	3.0
Five will get you two	Six	1.0
Six	What about seven	2.0
Does five go in	No	0.0
What about your four	What about seven	2.0
What about seven	Try seven	0.0
Try seven	No seven is not a factor	3.0
Six	What about eight	2.0
Six times what is 36	Six times six	3.0
You know six is going on	Now youre going to do youre going to write one	0.0
Youre at the oneminute warning	Okay	0.0
Good job	things that make up that number like a factor of five is obviously one because one is a factor of absolutely every single number	4.0
Multiply together to make five	You cant multiply three to make it a five	3.0
Adam	Its like adding it up 5  5  10 and 10  5 is 15	4.0
Say it again maybe I misheard it please	Its like 5  5 is 10 where you just keep adding five	4.0
Say what Adam described in your hands say it out loud	Repeated addition	3.0
Repeated addition	Multiples	1.0
Say it again louder	Multiples	3.0
Multiples everybody say that multiples	Multiples	0.0
Noah	A factor its not really a full multiplication problem its not like 2 x 2  4 that might be your target number or whatever the factor because youre trying to find all the factors for 36 to get to 36 so 2 x 18 thats a factor pair but if you have both of those numbers you want to take away one of those and just use one the numbers	4.0
Then when you have both of them its a pair	Its a factor pair	3.0
Do you want to add to that	Its like the addend of multiplication	1.0
Im trying to process what youre saying say that again	Its like an addend of multiplication the factor	1.0
Pick somebody thats doing this to respond to you	Amber	0.0
Amber	I see how you think its an addend but I really think its more of a number that is multiplied by another number to get the whole Like a target number but the number youre trying to get to like 36 like Noah was saying 18 is a factor because it can be multiplied by another number to get the whole number	4.0
Is one a factor of every number	Yes	0.0
Go	36 has even numbers in it and 2 is an even number	3.0
Brodie R	Two is a factor of 36 because 36 is an even number and you can split it into two numbers equally	4.0
Falicia	It kind of goes with that but its like a factor of every even number	3.0
What makes 3 a factor of 36 but not 37	Because 3 x 2 would be 6 but not 7	4.0
Falicia	Because you could split it equally into three groups	4.0
You can split what into three groups equally		3.0
Whats another way to prove that Margo	Another way to prove it is that I know that 3 x 11 is 33 and if you add another group of 3 it would be 3 x 12 which would be 36	4.0
Whats another way to prove that Jackson	Because 36 its an even and an odd number and three is an odd number so 3 can go into 36 12 times	4.0
Explain how 36 can be an even and an odd number	Because 36 is an even number because 2 can go into 36	4.0
Missy had an interesting way of knowing that 3 is a factor of 36 Ema	I said 3 is a factor 36 because if you take 3 x 2 it would be 6	4.0
I said 3 is a factor 36 because if you take 3 x 2 it would be 6	It wouldnt be a factor of 37 because 3 x 2 wouldnt be 7	4.0
You didnt explain the first part of how you knew that three was part of 36	Also three is a digit in 36	3.0
Shelby	I see where youre going with this	1.0
I see where youre going with this	I agree with the 3 x 2  6 and I think with the three is a digit I feel like youre trying to say that 3 x 10 would equal 30 and then you can take the 10 and the 2 and that would equal 12	4.0
Is that what youre saying	Yes	0.0
Kind of like partial products	Yes	0.0
Read this with me	I will use factors and multiples and common denominators to add and subtract fractions	0.0
Is four a factor of two	Yes	0.0
Or is two a factor in four	Yes	0.0
Is two a factor of six	Yes	0.0
Whatever youre multiplying by its going to be a factor right	Yes	0.0
Martha	You can use factors to help you find a common denominator because say you had a fraction problem like 16  18 and you would need to find a common denominator	4.0
What is a number that has the factors of 6 and 8	Then you could find the least common multiple	3.0
Least common	Least common factor or multiple	3.0
Read this with me	I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	0.0
Go	I see that maybe its like For one its connecting over 36 thats probably saying that 1 x 36 would equal 36	4.0
I see that maybe its like For one its connecting over 36 thats probably saying that 1 x 36 would equal 36	The 2 times the 18 36 yada yada so on so on	4.0
The 2 times the 18 36 yada yada so on so on	6 x 6 4 x 9 3 x 12	4.0
6 x 6 4 x 9 3 x 12	Like this except without the rainbows	4.0
Like this except without the rainbows	I am just now getting the rainbow part	1.0
That connects to make a pair	Im just not seeing that	0.0
Yes	For this see how it says multiples for 20 maybe its saying that if you count by five till you get to 20 and you count by four till you get to 20 the multiple of each of them	4.0
Are they factors	Five	3.0
Multiples is it a closed set	No	0.0
Lets start at the beginning and count	1 x 12	3.0
Is 2 a factor of 12	Yes	0.0
Yes because 2 x 6	Six yes	3.0
Then 3	Yes	0.0
3 x 4	Four yes	3.0
Four yes	Three	3.0
Weve just said 3 x 4	Then 5 no	3.0
No	6	3.0
Yes because 6 x 2	Two yes	3.0
Two yes	Then seven no	3.0
Then seven no	Eight no	3.0
Eight no	Nine no	3.0
Nine no	Ten no	3.0
Ten no	Eleven no	3.0
Eleven no	Twelve yes	3.0
How you connect it together so that you know that you have both numbers in the pair	Im going to rewrite these numbers	0.0
What is one times what	One times	0.0
Anything times one is the number itself so what matches up		3.0
Two does two going to go in 12	Yes	0.0
Two times	Six	3.0
What about three	Three should be like 3 x 6	3.0
No three times	Two	3.0
Does five go into 12	No	0.0

What number is that	30 and 568	3.0
You forgot to say what  the place value	Oh thousandths	3.0
Say the whole thing again	30 and 568 thousandths	3.0
Go ahead	And  say tenths is three	4.0
And  say tenths is three	I put a zero because it had to be something next to  so I put a zero	4.0
I put a zero because it had to be something next to  so I put a zero	Then she said tenths	4.0
Then she said tenths	She said put a five in the tenths and then a six in the hundredths and eight in the thousandths	4.0
	I got 200 and 740 thousandths because you said at first a two in the  and then you said a four in the thousandths place	4.0
I got 200 and 740 thousandths because you said at first a two in the  and then you said a four in the thousandths place	There is a two and four and you said the last number is seven in the tenths so I put a seven	4.0
There is a two and four and you said the last number is seven in the tenths so I put a seven	Then you didnt say anything else so I filled in the blanks with zeros	4.0

And that is a continued issue so were going to spend some time with strategies for that today	Youre basically annotating right now	0.0
Yes	For a fraction was it addition	3.0
Pardon	Was it addition	3.0
Well addition doesnt seem	Subtraction	3.0
I was like Doesnt seem as confusing	Subtraction you have to find a common denominator	3.0
Subtraction you have to find a common denominator	For multiplication you dont have to find a common denominator and you can just multiply the denominators	3.0
If youre confused then what can you do	Ask somebody	3.0
Thinking of what we just had on the poster no I dont expect you to be an expert but you can look at that	Thats multiply	3.0
At the neither	It doesnt tell you	3.0
In fact on a test youre going to be taking probably in a week or so before spring break theres a problem almost exactly like this on it	How do you know	0.0
Josiah my question is thinking about what I see here do you see any of the fraction or the subtraction keywords like left difference or remain Josiah	No	0.0
Pardon	No	0.0
Josiah said he didnt see subtraction keywords so tell me why do you think its subtraction	I think its subtraction because its saying what fraction of theSShas glasses	4.0
I think its subtraction because its saying what fraction of theSShas glasses	So that s subtracting I think	4.0
Boys	No	0.0
For zeros	I think its multiplication because of keywords like of and of is a keyword of multiplication	4.0
I think its multiplication because of keywords like of and of is a keyword of multiplication	It s also asking how much glasses of the	4.0

Yes	Well it also says of again	3.0
Amy why multiplication	I think multiplication because it says of and thats one of the keywords for multiplication	4.0
I think multiplication because it says of and thats one of the keywords for multiplication	Then for area you have to multiply	4.0
Whats the formula for area	Width times length	3.0
Ellis whats your thinking	My thinking is I think it s subtraction because it says left over at the end of the problem	4.0
Bryson whats your thinking	I think its multiplication because it says of at the end of the problem	4.0

Whats this one	The none of them because it says that he planted 25 of the garden its kind of dividing it	4.0
The none of them because it says that he planted 25 of the garden its kind of dividing it	Like you have to figure out the fraction of it like just a fraction	4.0
Are we dividing into equal parts	No	0.0
What do you think	Im at multiplication because its asking what fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce	4.0
Im at multiplication because its asking what fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce	I know its not subtraction because youre not subtracting	4.0
Natalie are you listening to your classmate	youre not subtracting it but I dont think youre not dividing it or doing either of them	4.0
youre not subtracting it but I dont think youre not dividing it or doing either of them	I think its multiplication because its asking how much of the garden is planted with the potatoes or lettuce	4.0
I think its multiplication because its asking how much of the garden is planted with the potatoes or lettuce	I think its  you how much youre planting	4.0
what do you think	I think its neither and maybe addition because it says he planted 25	4.0
Boys stop it	with potatoes and 18 of the garden with lettuce	4.0
with potatoes and 18 of the garden with lettuce	What fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes and lettuce	4.0
What fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes and lettuce	When it says that it seems like their adding both of them to figure out in total how many potatoes and lettuce there is in the garden	4.0
Lettuce and potatoes	No	0.0

Draw pictures of these turns using your arc to show the direction of each one	The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	0.0
What is Number 11 asking us for	Its asking us to draw pictures of turns using an arc to the direction of each one	3.0
So what do we have	The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	3.0
What does that look like	Excuse me	0.0
So half a turn	So were facing right here and then I think we have to figure out	3.0
Stand up	to do a half turn	3.0
So if were standing and were facing the front right	That way youre facing this way the arrow	3.0
Are we going clockwise or counterclockwise	Clockwise	3.0
So we would go half turn	We would just draw an arrow this way	3.0
So it would look like	Wait	0.0
Wait	How are we	0.0
How are we	Can I see	0.0
Can I see	Okay	0.0
Okay	I get that	0.0
So it was like this and a half turn would mean now its	Like that	3.0
Daniel well tell us what youre thinking	Im thinking we show a clock mostly turns right so we should do it left in like a quarter of a half turn	4.0
So what do you mean by a quarter of a halfturn	Instead of doing a full half turn you want to cut	4.0
Instead of doing a full half turn you want to cut	If you do a full half turn and just erase half of that	4.0
Im hearing you say half of half is one quarter	Yes	0.0
Or onefourth times two is one half	Yes	0.0
So that would look like one quarter turn counterclockwise would be what	Yes	0.0
Yes	Like that	0.0
So now it would be facing this way	Yes	0.0

Why Zoe	Because we are turning that way	4.0
What are our choices	Ninety to a hundred 180  180	3.0
You need to look at where the arch is on the angle	I think that would be 90 through 180 degrees because its like almost a right angle its just a tad bit	4.0
I think that would be 90 through 180 degrees because its like almost a right angle its just a tad bit	Yes	1.0
Yes	Its up to	0.0
Its up to	Well wait	0.0
Well wait	Yes	0.0
Yes	Nolans right	1.0
Nolans right	Nolans right	1.0
Nolans right	Nolans right with the 90 between 180	1.0
Tell me why youre doing that	I think we should maybe circle 90 to 180 degrees so that we know its that one	3.0
What did you guys get	We got 90 to 180	3.0
Acute obtuse or right	Obtuse	3.0
Lets do the next one	I think its a zero between 90	3.0
Talk to your team and tell your friends why	Because its less than like a 90degree turn	4.0
Because its less than like a 90degree turn	I think its zero through 90	3.0
Why	Zero to 90	3.0
How do you know	The angle is smaller than 90 degrees	3.0
How do you know	Because thats pointing this way	4.0
Because thats pointing this way	If it were a right angle or 90 degrees it would be like that and its	4.0
The line  would meet at a perfect  degrees	Pointing like that	3.0
So  you guys say acute	Yes	0.0
Would you please tell your teammates talk about what is symmetry	Symmetry its where its the same on both sides	3.0

If we drew a line right here could we fold it and both sides would match up perfectly it would be a reflection	Yes	0.0
On Number 14 what is a strategy to draw the other half	We could measure it	3.0
How did you know what to do	We could fold it in half and	3.0
Fern will you tell us how did you know what to do	Because I know its a square you could  a diamond and a Its half	4.0
On number 14 how do you know what to draw where	You just kind of look at it	3.0
You just kind of look at it	You kind of copy it	3.0
When you say look at it look at what	Look at the shape of it	3.0
Look at the shape of it	Its like	0.0
Its like	Or you could fold it the reflection	3.0
What youre thinking about is if it was flipped over the line if that figure was flipped over the line of symmetry what would it look like on the other side	Yes	0.0
Thats another way to check	Thats not	0.0
Thats not	Its not what	0.0
Its not what	She just did that on a math test	0.0
This is a clue to you what kind of problem are you going to have on Number 15	Were going to talk about it	0.0
Remember we need	Story	3.0
A single	Number	3.0
Okay	Three boys each want to buy a football and a science kit	0.0
Three boys each want to buy a football and a science kit	Together they have 65	0.0
Together they have 65	If each football costs 8 and each science kit costs 11 how much money will the boys have left over after theyve purchased the items	0.0
What is the problem asking and what are the steps	Or we could do three times and then we could do like	3.0
What are you guys thinking that Number 15 is asking us to find	I think its asking us to find how much it costs in total	3.0
I think its asking us to find how much it costs in total	No	1.0
No	Find	0.0
Part of it is	Find how much money the boys will have left over	3.0
Were going to find how much the total would be and then how much money is left after they buy those items	Yes	0.0
Whats our strategy for setting up this problem	I think I know	0.0
Tell me why you have three times eight	Because three times eight is the football and then three times 11 is the science kit and then minus	4.0
So the first thing you have to do is find that total	Dash was asking us	0.0
You want to find out how much money is it going to cost them to buy those items	6500	3.0
You could but is this addition or multiplication	Multiplication	3.0
Are you sure about that	Of course	0.0
Why would we need addition not multiplication	Because multiplication if we add this total and this total then you would multiply those  because that would be not the correct answer	4.0
How much do the Whats the other thing	Science kits	3.0
We put those two totals together	Then we can do equals	3.0
How much do the footballs cost	800	3.0
And how many boys are there	Three	3.0
Then we have	11	3.0
What do we need to do with these two amounts	What would that unknown letter be	2.0
Were going to be adding the two of them	Guys Im done	0.0
Guys Im done	Whats three times eight	2.0
Youre going to figure out both of these and then add those both together	What if its wrong	0.0
What if its wrong	Three times eight 24	4.0
Three times eight 24	Its not wrong	0.0
Its not wrong	You dont know that	1.0
You dont know that	I did all the math	0.0
I did all the math	I have no  and I have no	0.0
We are going to do a switch	What are you doing	0.0
If you were at the back table you are going to go to the desks now	Do we work with partners	0.0
If you are the desks you are going to head to the carpet	The answer is 45	3.0
Id like you to please turn to Number 11	Why is this split	0.0
Number 11	Number 11	0.0
If we are looking at this line right here and were turning it a half	A half turn	0.0
Were turning to the right	Oh your right	0.0
Now what is B asking us to do	One fourth turn counterclockwise	3.0
Instead of clockwise were going to	Left	3.0
How do we know how far to go	Its one fourth	3.0
Its one fourth	We did one whole right there so about 180 degrees	3.0
One hundred eighty is a half	Its going to be 270	3.0
If you have 1 how many quarters is one quarter	Four	3.0
Well how many quarters are in a dollar	Four	3.0
Michael can you read Number 12 for us	Estimate the size of the angle	0.0
Estimate the size of the angle	Circle the best answer	0.0
Anyone willing to share their thinking how they know	I think its zero through 90 number one because C right there it would probably be 90	4.0
What does a 90degree angle look like	It looks like that	0.0
A perfect	This ones like this	0.0
Liza	I think its the second one 90 degrees No 180 degrees to 270 because if this was 90 Wait	4.0
I think its the second one 90 degrees No 180 degrees to 270 because if this was 90 Wait	No	4.0
No	Yes if this was 90 itd be right here or	4.0
Is our arc	I cant see	0.0
Right here	No	0.0
Is it a little bigger than 90 degrees	Yes	0.0
But this is 180 is it all the way at 180	No	0.0
Talk to your partners	I think its obtuse	3.0
Say it out loud	Obtuse	3.0
Write down the word obtuse please	I already did	0.0
Go	I think its acute	3.0
I think its acute	Yes its acute	1.0
Yes its acute	Zero to 90	3.0
How do you know	I know because this one is going that like this and like Landon said its like an L if it was 90 degrees so it has to be 180 if its more up than that one because this one is kind of down  This ones straightup	4.0
Zero to 90 is acute	Oh I thought it was  that one is like this and it was more like	3.0
If the arc inside this 90degree mark that means it s less than 90 degrees	Thank you	0.0
Remember the lesson where we drew the lines of symmetry	No	0.0
That s a good thing we re revealing huh	Wait	0.0
Wait	What day was it	0.0
What day was it	It was Wednesday	0.0
Lucas tell us what you re thinking	The first one I thought because the square if you ve got a square piece of paper you could fold it one way which will be parallel to	4.0
If you drew a line down the middle and we folded it would the edges matchup	Yes	0.0
Yes	Then you could also do another line across	3.0
Like this	Yes	0.0
Yes	Because both lines are  all you could to do	3.0
What do you think	I think there should be across like through the middle	3.0
So what does that tell us	That either one two three there s three	3.0
Could there be four	Yes because it can go the other way	4.0
We folded it on this line of symmetry would the corners match up	Yes	0.0
You may	Ms Jackson just told us	0.0
Ms Jackson just told us	She said sometimes there could be as many lines as how many sides on a shape	3.0
Look we have one two How many lines of symmetry	Four	3.0
How many lines of symmetry on the next figure	One	3.0
What s the figure called	Pentagon	3.0
Pentagon	No	1.0
No	Trapezoid	1.0
Thats four sides	Trapezoid	3.0
Trapezoid	Well how would you fold it this way because this side is bigger than that side	2.0
What if we had If this is the figure	You re not folding it down	0.0
You re not folding it down	No	0.0
No	If you fold it that way it would be too big	4.0
See how it s similar to this	Yes but if you fold it from this side	3.0
Yes but if you fold it from this side	Yes	1.0
Yes	Why do you have that	2.0
I would fold it right here so that this corner would line up with this one	Wait because you couldn t go down the middle	4.0
It wouldn t match	Yes because if you fold it up it will just be a little off	4.0
Liza	With this one I think it s a quadrangle	3.0
With this one I think it s a quadrangle	I think	0.0
What does quadrangle mean	It s a foursided shape	3.0
You got it	Quad means four	4.0
Quad means four	Then it would be a square rectangle or slanted square	4.0
C looks like this	It s almost a square	3.0
What makes this not a square	Because the sides are more slanted than that	4.0
Do we have four right angles	Yes	0.0
We don t have four right angles but we have four sides	What also doesn t make any square is that a square has of four lines of symmetry and this one only has	3.0
If we folded it here what would happen	It would be overlapped	3.0
It would be overlapped	It got overlapped but	3.0
If the corners wouldn t match up perfectly that s not a line of symmetry	Unless you folded it open	4.0
Could we fold it here	Yes	0.0
Would this match perfectly with this	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
What about here	Yes	0.0
Are there any others	I think we can do a line like fold it	3.0
This way	You can t fold a line down the middle	3.0
Is it going to match up	No	3.0
We cannot have a line of symmetry here	That one will come down here and then that one will come over there	3.0
Would it line up	No	0.0
These are the only two lines of symmetry on this figure	Like  said you can t do that way because	3.0
What did I start with here Liza	Two and one half	3.0

Wait	I havent done it yet	0.0
I havent done it yet	I ll tell you	0.0
I ll tell you	It set for a 120 clockwise	3.0

I drew the other half of the angle which is just	I drew half of the clock	3.0
I drew half of the clock	I drew half of a circle and an arrow at the right end	3.0
Noah does yours match mine	Oh but is it okay if I	0.0
Yes	Yes my	0.0
Yes my	Wait but that would be turning counterclockwise	3.0
Wait but that would be turning counterclockwise	If you put the arrow above then it would be turning counterclockwise and it says to turn clockwise	3.0
If you put the arrow above then it would be turning counterclockwise and it says to turn clockwise	No hes still moving	1.0
No hes still moving	Hes still moving clockwise	1.0
Yes	Hes going to the left to the right	1.0
Okay and B is instead of a halfturn London will you read B for us 11B	Onefourth turn counterclockwise	0.0
Were going onequarter of a turn counterclockwise	I did it like this	3.0
I did it like this	Oh I did a quarter	3.0
Oh I did a quarter	Thats why	0.0
You got that	I did it like this	3.0
Matthew look at my counterclockwise	I cant see yours	0.0

Then ask your friends around you if they agree	I think its in between 90 and 180 degrees	3.0
I think its in between 90 and 180 degrees	Can I share my thinking	0.0
Can I share my thinking	I agree	1.0
Okay	It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned	4.0
It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned	It looks like its more than 90 degrees	4.0
It looks like its more than 90 degrees	Its more than a hundred degrees	4.0
They might agree disagree addon	I agree because the arrow is pointing to the right so its not turning all the way	1.0
How do we know this angle is less than 180 degrees	I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	4.0
I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	Its not facing it and its higher so its not going to be that	4.0
Got it	The  it makes its not one side to the other side	3.0
So 180 degrees would mean this line would be straight across	Yes	0.0
So we know its less than 180	Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	4.0
Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	Also	0.0
So 180 degrees would be this line all the way across right here	Its bigger than that and	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
I love it	I was going to say you can sometimes get confused of which way its going because or if its going this way you know its not going to be  its going the other way	4.0
What do we name this angle	Obtuse	3.0

What do you mean by the other way	Well not going a different way but like kind of  on the A and B	3.0
Matthew our three choices are right here zero through 90 90 to 180 or 180 to 270	I think zero to 90 because if it was here that would be 260 and it couldnt be behind 260	4.0
I think zero to 90 because if it was here that would be 260 and it couldnt be behind 260	If it was just slightly there past zero	4.0
Can you have someone to addon to your thinking please	Logan	0.0
Logan	I was doing this in my head	0.0
I was doing this in my head	I was imagining a line here and this is 90 degrees	3.0
Do you agree with Matthew that its less than 90	Yes	1.0
Youre showing why	I think it would be zero through	3.0
Do you see how Logan drew in where the 90 degrees is	Angle BOX is less than 90 degrees	3.0
And then he said	I got BOX	3.0
Finish what you were saying	the angle BOX	3.0
the angle BOX	This would be angle	3.0
This would be angle	I thought that is should be like zero through 89 instead of 0 through 90 because I think this is an acute angle and acute is different than	4.0
Less than 90	Yes and	0.0
I see what youre saying	A 90 is a complete different angle	3.0

What form is this in	Standard	3.0
Standard	Standard	1.0
When we factor the standard form equation what do we call that form	Standard form	3.0
No this is standard so when we factor it I used to call it factor form but the big idea has a different name for it	Standard	3.0
Youre getting the right idea Chloe	Standard	3.0
Standard	Yes youve got it	1.0
Yes youve got it	Right	0.0
Hold on	is so quiet	0.0
Whats the thing that factor form tells us	The intercepts	3.0
The intercepts	That it intercepts	1.0

When you feel confident about those two then move on to problem number one two three and four	I havent factored	0.0
I havent factored	Completing this	0.0
Thats the only thing	that would take longer to do	3.0
Well well compromise	and then you have X  5	3.0
Do one we really need	Okay	0.0
Okay	Look at this one	0.0
This is five and six	multiplies to this as this	3.0
multiplies to this as this	The hell	0.0
The hell	Like the quadratic formula	3.0
Like the quadratic formula	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus	4.0
We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus	Weve got the negative  but this is a positive	4.0
Weve got the negative  but this is a positive	So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five	4.0
So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five	So I did positive two and negative five and then	4.0
So I did positive two and negative five and then	Does that make sense	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Thats	I have a negative	3.0
If I know X how do I find Y	Point it towards the X	3.0
I plug that in the equation	Got it	0.0
Okay	Im starting to figure out how you like get it	0.0
Im starting to figure out how you like get it	Wheres the X times that and then you square it on the outside	3.0
Wheres the X times that and then you square it on the outside	Thats what Im talking about	0.0
Thats what Im talking about	Yes we can find them	3.0
Yes we can find them	Ill tell you if I  or you can just plug it off	1.0
Ill tell you if I  or you can just plug it off	just going to point it in there	3.0
Well the good news is you dont have to	No I need to	0.0
No I need to	Were staying  math today	0.0
So this is more the kind of strategy for this one	Negative one over 12	3.0
Let me figure out a couple of sample problems and Ill put them up	So 15 is the X value	3.0
So 15 is the X value	Thats where	0.0
Thats where	So we plug that in  negative B	3.0
So we plug that in  negative B	Oh you have to plug in 22 five times	1.0
Oh you have to plug in 22 five times	225 plus or minus  negative 145	3.0
225 plus or minus  negative 145	Thats negative	1.0
Thats negative	No thats 235	1.0
No thats 235	Its going to be 1225 negative 1225	3.0
Its going to be 1225 negative 1225	Yes	1.0
Yes	Write that there and then we dont have to	3.0
Write that there and then we dont have to	Since that is 15 away from here	3.0
Since that is 15 away from here	We did it	0.0
We did it	For sure	0.0
For sure	I hit the car button but nothing happened	3.0
I hit the car button but nothing happened	Well the Y intercept is	1.0
Well the Y intercept is	Nothing happened	1.0
Nothing happened	So negative 1225	1.0
So negative 1225	Yes	1.0
Yes	We did it	0.0
We did it	We did	0.0
We did	How are you supposed to do that	2.0
How are you supposed to do that	Next one	0.0
Thats what I was hoping to do	Now were going to do the	0.0
but I could check just to see if its	Yes negative two and five are there	4.0
Yes negative two and five are there	And then that would be negative	4.0
And then that would be negative	No itd be 124	1.0
No itd be 124	Yes but then you square it then itd be positive	1.0
Yes but then you square it then itd be positive	So you get 025 or 14	3.0
So you get 025 or 14	We keep it in fraction	3.0
Ladies and gentlemen we get to stay together until three	Oh no	0.0

So again Im in standard form	I want Taco Bell	0.0
My Avalue is one whats my B value	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Ten is called a	Yintercept	3.0
What Im hoping is somewhere in your memory is this phrase factors of C What is C in this case	Ten	3.0
What are the factors of 10	One	3.0
One	Ten	1.0
Were being systematic	One two	3.0
Its one and	Five	3.0
Or two and	Five	3.0
Five	Five	1.0
Or three	No	0.0
Or four		3.0
Or five	Two	3.0
Whats different about that set	There has to be a multiple	3.0
My second set of factors of C	It has that	0.0
So my Bvalue is	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Three does one of those combination add to three	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Which one	Five	3.0
Five	Maybe five and two	1.0
Maybe five and two	Two and	3.0
Two and	Five and negative two	1.0
Five and negative two	Five and negative two	1.0
Do I have any factors of C that add up to B	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
What does that mean I have to use	Quadratic formula	3.0
Does one of those add up to three	Negative two and five	3.0
Whats always true about Xintercepts my two ordered pairs whats always true about an Xintercept	The Y is zero	3.0
So this has to be zero here and Im multiplying two things together and my answer is zero what does one of them have to be	Zero	3.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Right	Yes	0.0
How do I find the line of symmetry	You add those two together	3.0
Y is going to be negative 15 minus two negative 15 plus five	negative 10 you add that to one	3.0
Negative three halves oh this would be	I cant because that doesnt make any sense	0.0
I cant because that doesnt make any sense	Its negative its not negative B	3.0
Its negative its not negative B	Yes but the whole fraction is	1.0
Yes but the whole fraction is	If its negative	3.0
All right just finish that work for tomorrow	That was like epic though	0.0

can you explain that	I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre doing 26  26	3.0
Can you try again just so that everybody knows what you said so they can feedback you	I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre adding 26  26  26  26 because thats the same thing as 4 x 26	4.0
Can you call on somebody to respond to you please	Stella	0.0
Stella	No I agree with her	1.0
No I agree with her	Oh	0.0
Oh	Hudson	0.0
Hudson	I see why you thought that each two squares equals a whole because I think you got confused by where the 4 when it said 4 x 26 theres four groups of two inside that you thought that two blocks equal the whole	4.0
Let it out	Squares	3.0
Now say it out loud	Rectangles	3.0
Thank you	Two squares and the rectangle are equal to a whole	3.0
Im confused about that part	Because theyre supposed to be four wholes so two of them	4.0
Okay somebody thats saying Hey can I ask you a question to help you	What does each square represent	2.0
What does each square represent	16	3.0
What represents the whole in this diagram	The rectangle	3.0
What do you guys think of that Conor	Yes	1.0
Explain your thinking again	Because there are four 26 which is	3.0
What do you mean by that	I think she means	0.0
Shes so close	Because the whole rectangle is colored in and so that must be a whole	4.0
Because the whole rectangle is colored in and so that must be a whole	Then the 26 are the two squares in the next rectangle	4.0
Okay and so you have how many 26	Four	3.0
Whats your learning here	I	0.0
whats your learning	To use better vocabulary	3.0
Charlie	Make your answer clear and	3.0

48 is it the same thing as 12	Yes	0.0
Troy number four	I didnt	0.0
Stella number four please	Number four our number  10 x 45	3.0

Hudson	Is this number okay	0.0
Is this number okay	10 x 48   by 5	4.0
Number five Alijah	My number model was 14 x 56  F	3.0
What dont you agree with Oaklee	Well he could say it differently	1.0
Well he could say it differently	I agree with him but he also could say 14 x 5  70   6  F	4.0
Hudson tell him what we just said	We just said we want to The learning intention is about  use it as a fraction	3.0
Then what was the actual answer Alijah	11 and 46	3.0
You have to include the unit	11 and 46 feet	3.0
Do	Yes	0.0
How is this different Gabriella	This is different because were multiplying whole numbers by fractions to find fractions	3.0

Does that makes sense	Yes	0.0
Can someone read this for us	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	I have  I can explain how one or take  model is a representation of fraction products	0.0
Clay what does this mean that we have to be able to do	It means that were going to have to be able to explain how our paper folding model or drawing helps us explain how we did the fraction product	3.0

Hank	I did 12   5 is 10 and 25	4.0
I did 12   5 is 10 and 25	And then we do Its 2 and 25 then when you do that times two you get 4 and 45	4.0
Is anybody else in here so visual	Yes	0.0
Whats 2 x 3	six	3.0
Whats 3 x 2	Six	3.0
Does the order matter	No	0.0
Can you do that	25 of 12	3.0
25 of 12	What I thought was 12   5 equals because 5 x 2 is 10 and then you have 25 left	4.0
What I thought was 12   5 equals because 5 x 2 is 10 and then you have 25 left	Its 5  2 and 25	4.0
Its 5  2 and 25	Then I did that times 2 and then I got 4 and 45	4.0
Hank	I was finding 15 of 12	3.0
And then why did you multiply it times two	I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12	4.0
I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12	I did find the numerator which was two	4.0
Ryland	You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	4.0
You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	4.0
If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	Youre only finding 25 of 12	4.0
Im going to show you this	Yes	0.0
too	I think  time	0.0
I think  time	What I did was I drew the two rules because I drew one plus one equals two	4.0
What I did was I drew the two rules because I drew one plus one equals two	Then I drew two halves because  a half plus a half that will be  two	4.0
Then I drew two halves because  a half plus a half that will be  two	12 plus 12 will equal three	4.0
Okay talk to us about your thinking	My thinking was theres  and then since theres 24 going into each  I put a one and two and then since you  theres only one more	4.0
My thinking was theres  and then since theres 24 going into each  I put a one and two and then since you  theres only one more	You have the  equal share	4.0
You have the  equal share	I split it into half and I gave one and two	4.0
I split it into half and I gave one and two	Each half gets one	4.0
I see your answer there	Eighths are equivalent to fours you can make	3.0
No	Fourths are equivalent to eighth	3.0
How many eighths are equivalent to 14	Two	3.0
How can you prove that	Its because	0.0
Explain your thinking	I drew eights and this are equal to four	3.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
Nicely done	Since  12 and 34	3.0
We	Since we were trying to get 12 of 34 we knew that 12 of 34 wasnt youre going to do 12 of 34 because theres not enough	4.0
Since we were trying to get 12 of 34 we knew that 12 of 34 wasnt youre going to do 12 of 34 because theres not enough	34 thats just three  If you do just three you cant split three into 12 and you cant say 1 and 12 of the first fraction where we said 12 of three because were doing a fraction not a whole number	4.0
34 thats just three  If you do just three you cant split three into 12 and you cant say 1 and 12 of the first fraction where we said 12 of three because were doing a fraction not a whole number	We got eights and we knew that 28 is equivalent to 14	4.0
We got eights and we knew that 28 is equivalent to 14	We dont need  We knew that 28 is equivalent to 14 and Since 28 is equivalent to 14 we said Since theres 34 we said theyre 68	4.0
We dont need  We knew that 28 is equivalent to 14 and Since 28 is equivalent to 14 we said Since theres 34 we said theyre 68	You could split six into half into a half and half of six is three	4.0
You could split six into half into a half and half of six is three	We said the answer is 38 because half of six is three and if we do 68 its dividable by 12 because	4.0
Maybe show us that show us that we will not	You could do	0.0
There you go	This is one person this is the other person	4.0
This is one person this is the other person	They each get 14	4.0
They each get 14	Theres 14 remaining so you split 14 into 12 and you give each person 18	4.0
Put your eighths on there	Yes	0.0
to show that	Since there is 14 remaining and theres two people you can put 28 over the fourth	4.0
Since there is 14 remaining and theres two people you can put 28 over the fourth	Then you can give each person 18 then it would be 14 it would be 38 because 28 is equivalent to 14 like weve said	4.0
Then you can give each person 18 then it would be 14 it would be 38 because 28 is equivalent to 14 like weve said	It pretty much gives you them a 38 if you give him 18	4.0

Okay	I said I think her new trapezoid	3.0
Excuse me	will get more wider	4.0
will get more wider	I think this because Amy created a rule that should make it wider	4.0
I think this because Amy created a rule that should make it wider	So she was the one that made a rule that should make her trapezoid bigger in width because she said she doesnt want it taller	4.0

Sorry the tumblers had eight performers three hours and 22 an hour	We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait	4.0
We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait	Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528	4.0
Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528	Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour	4.0
Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour	Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16	4.0
Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16	192	4.0
192	Because we did the estimate before we did our answer	4.0
Say that again Hunter	We did our estimate before our answer so that we could figure out our answer before we did it	4.0
Okay	Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200	4.0
Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200	We took out 200 from 530 too and got 330 and then with our number model we did 528  192 and got 336 and since 336 is our answer we only need six off of our estimate	4.0

Tell us	It is saying you find denominators and multiply them but we are not multiplying the denominator but multiplying fractions	3.0
Is denominator top number or bottom number	Bottom	3.0
Say it	Numerator	3.0
Go	I know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	0.0
Will you share your thinking that I heard you talk about	I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	4.0
I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	If youre adding on another eighths that would be five eighths and one and five eighths is really close to four eighths and its one eighth away from a half and its three eighths away from the whole	4.0
Will you remind me your name please	Im Jenny	0.0
Jenny	I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	4.0
I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	Since youre adding to one half you would round this up to one whole	4.0
Jenny will you call on someone else to add on to what you were thinking	Virginia	0.0
Virginia	I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	2.0
I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	4.0
You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	So youre having to round it up to one whole	4.0
So youre having to round it up to one whole	Youre going to round it back onto one half because of the middle more	4.0
Julie	We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	4.0
We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	So if you are rounding it it would almost be a whole minus a whole which we thought would be whole zero	4.0
Thank you	I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	4.0
I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	When you have one tenth it would be just a little less than one hundredth than one	4.0
Eliza would you call on someone else to share their thinking	Julie	0.0
Julie	I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	2.0
I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	4.0
Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	Thats over a whole which we decided will be closer to a whole	4.0
Can you check for me	Back	0.0
Is that better	Yes	0.0
All four of the fourths	What color	0.0
Theyre yellow	Yellow fourths	0.0
Tell us about your thinking Robin	First I split the circle into fifths and then I shaded in pink the three fifths and then I shaded it orange the one fifth too	4.0
Thank you	Then I did an orange of one fifth so you could see thats two different numbers	4.0
So you shaded in three of them and then one of them and your total is	Four fifths	3.0
Go	So what I did is I took one half and  a fourth  so then I drew it and I came up  and then I connected another one	4.0
How many fourths make up a half	Two	3.0
Can I have you guys please turn your eyes and ears this way over to Noah	I did a number line strategy and	3.0
There we go	What I did I did two number lines	4.0
What I did I did two number lines	One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	4.0
One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer	4.0
He said he converted one half to	Three fourths	3.0
So that it is	An equivalent fraction	3.0
Say Equivalent fraction	Equivalent fraction	0.0
How do you know one half	If you have a number line youd see two fourths sits directly underneath one half so thats why you have an equal	4.0
that	like to add	0.0
like to add	add the root of the equivalent is equal	3.0
add the root of the equivalent is equal	So thats not	0.0
Whats your math reasoning	Fraction pieces	3.0
did you want to add on	Oh I couldnt	0.0
Go	You said	0.0
So 14 and 13 is looks like this	Yes thats	0.0
Yes thats	I knew	0.0
My friends would you please turn your chairs turn your body so that you can see the front screen	What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	4.0
What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	So I added 14 and 13	4.0
So I added 14 and 13	So 14 is equivalent to 312 and because it was equivalent to 312 and then 13 was equivalent to 412 I did 312 plus 412 is 712	4.0
If you were looking at the actual color fraction pieces these would be the colors and the pieces you would use 14 is the equivalent to one yellow piece 14 is equivalent to	312	3.0
Three green pieces 13 one orange piece is equivalent to	412	3.0
We are starting with 14 plus 13 is that right Julie	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	4.0
A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	4.0
So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	4.0
It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	4.0
So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	So I did the same thing	4.0
So I did the same thing	You have to do the same thing	4.0
You have to do the same thing	1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	4.0
1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	So now it will be 412  312	4.0
So now it will be 412  312	Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	4.0
Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	So four plus three would be seven	4.0
So four plus three would be seven	That will be 712	4.0
Youre using the multiplication strategy to help you get common denominators	Uhhuh	0.0
The multiplication strategy gets you two equivalent fractions so that then you can add the numerators	Yes	0.0
Yes	For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	3.0
For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	Thats what it is like	0.0
Thats what it is like	So thats what I did to	0.0
So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator	Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator	4.0
So if I multiply the denominator by the other denominator and then whatever you multiply the denominator by you also need to multiply the	Numerator	3.0
We have 4  3  12 and 1  3 equals	Three	3.0
times say it Katie	One fourth	3.0
What did you guys get	712	3.0

Say it with a Southern drawl	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	0.0
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Okay	0.0
Alice	You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	4.0
You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	4.0
Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	So then two times three is six	4.0
So then two times three is six	So then your new fraction is 36	4.0
Are you making that number bigger by multiplying it by one	No	0.0
Yes Eliza	Three times five it would be two times five would be 10 and then you would say	4.0
Right	Which would be five and then two times five will be 10 which you would get 510	4.0
This would be	Five tenths	3.0

I think maybe it has to do with 5 and 2 because 5 times 2 is 10	It has to be	1.0
Thats something to do with multiplication rule	Yes	0.0
What are we thinking about for our learning intention today	Because the multiplication	3.0
Because the multiplication	The second number we multiplied was both two times five like this	3.0
turn the screen back to todays learning and  Today were using equivalent fractions to finding common denominator to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a	Multiplication rule	3.0
Faith will you share with us your thinking  please	I said that they are a common denominator and the denominator is the same	3.0
I said that they are a common denominator and the denominator is the same	Also the numerator is 110 of the difference from	3.0
Would you call on someone else please	Me and my partner said is that  the denominator is 10 and the first one is 510 and the second one is 410 so theres a 110 difference too	4.0
Now that you have that my friends can you now that you have common denominators can we add	Yes	0.0
Ready	Lets do this	0.0
12 is equal to	510	3.0
This 12 is the same amount as 510 and then this 25 its the same amount as	410	3.0
510  410 fifth graders what is it	910	3.0
Answer right here is	910	3.0
Whats 12 equivalent	510	3.0
Whats 25 equivalent to	410	3.0

I will be successful when I understand how to measure volume by displacement	I will explain why displacement method works for measuring volume	0.0
Nora	It is length times width times height	3.0
Nora would you say that one more time please	The volume is length times width times height	3.0
Okay	The inside of an object	3.0
Aria	Volume is the amount of space an object takes up	3.0
Victoria	The measurement inside an object	3.0
Naomi	Its	0.0
Volume is	Volume is also base times height	3.0

Did you guys do something on volume yesterday	Yes	0.0
Do we know	A thousand	3.0
A thousand how did we know	Base times height	3.0
Sarah	area of the base times height	3.0
Why	Because its quite easy	4.0
How would you do that	Length of the bottom times	3.0
Length times width	Times width	3.0
Then times the height	Yes	0.0
How would you find the volume of this	I would multiply the area of the base multiplied by the height	3.0
Right so will that trend always work when you have a rectangular prism or a cube	Yes	0.0
You see that top picture up there	Yes	0.0
Ally Ive not heard from you yet today	You probably could but it might be a little harder because the base area might be like right here on the bottom it might not be the same height or the same width as the whole	4.0
Lydia please call on someone to add on or to share some different thinking	Me and my partner thought that we wouldnt be able to use the same strategy just a little like they said because it doesnt really have a base or size that you could find the length and width of so it would be really hard if we tried to use that strategy	4.0
Me and my partner thought that we wouldnt be able to use the same strategy just a little like they said because it doesnt really have a base or size that you could find the length and width of so it would be really hard if we tried to use that strategy	Because of this round size were thinking we wouldnt really be able to find the	4.0
A different method	Yes its round so its a lot harder to find the length and width	4.0
Could you call someone else to add on	We kind of thought that it wouldnt work	3.0

The numerator is always one such as the denominator	We both agree already but yours sounds better	1.0
We both agree already but yours sounds better	You have a longer definition	1.0
You have a longer definition	Its a fraction model where the numerator is the same and then denominator is different	3.0
Its a fraction model where the numerator is the same and then denominator is different	The numerator is the same of a one fraction the denominator is different	3.0
The numerator is the same of a one fraction the denominator is different	Because the numerator is always one does that mean none of these fractions could ever be equivalent	2.0
The denominator is the	Is the number of	3.0

Tell me more about the	The whole fraction	3.0
The number of	The number	0.0
Of pieces in the whole	Yes	0.0
Mia may I have you come up and stand up front and share is it okay if I have you we put your bottom definition up	A unit fraction is one for the numerator and the denominator is the number that shows how many pieces are in a whole	3.0
A unit fraction is one for the numerator and the denominator is the number that shows how many pieces are in a whole	Basically in a unit fraction the numerator should be a one and the denominator is going to be the amount of pieces drawn or shown in the denominator	3.0
Its okay but I just want to make it clear to our class that a unit fraction always has one as the what	Numerator	3.0
And whats the denominator in the unit fraction	Any number	3.0
But it shows the	Pieces that are in the whole	3.0
Say the unit fraction	One fifteenth	3.0
The unit fraction is always when we have a one as the numerator and the denominator is the number of pieces correct	Yes	0.0

Go	The fraction  asking what is one fifth of 15	3.0
What is that asking us to do	Asking us to figure out what is one fifth of 15 and what number it is	3.0
Would you call you on someone else please to continue our conversation	Sofia	0.0
Sofia	Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	3.0
Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	I might  more except that I think that it may be how much of a fifth would go into 15	1.0
How would you prove this is right	and five times three equals 15	4.0
Tell me more about this	I drew this because of one fifth and I did  and then Im going to shade it and then Im just going to	3.0
Jayden would you start as our first teacher to share how did you think about what is one fifth of 15	First I drew  which is 15	4.0
First I drew  which is 15	Each row here is one fifth  is also three and the whole represents 15	4.0
Jayden call on someone	You have something Brendan	0.0
You have something Brendan	He explained it very well	1.0
Was your thinking similar	It was my thinking was similar	1.0
It was my thinking was similar	Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	1.0
Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	4.0
I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	So that will be 15 fifths	4.0
So that will be 15 fifths	Then if you break that into a mixed number it will just be three wholes	4.0
Hey Ryan tell us about your thinking	So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths	4.0
Why	I did that because you said one fifth of 15	4.0
I did that because you said one fifth of 15	So I made this	4.0
So I made this	Then I knew five times three equal 15	4.0
Then I knew five times three equal 15	So I did three on each my fifths	4.0
When you said you did you wrote three on each fifth because	Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	4.0
Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	So I wrote threes to represent my answer	4.0
Call on someone	Because he knew that three times five is 15	1.0
Everybody say thank you Ryan	Thank you Ryan	0.0
So fifth graders I want you to be thinking about look at how there were several different ways to solve one fifth of 15	There was five one fifth and  five times three equals 15	4.0
No what do you think about how Avery solved Elijah	She put three into fives	1.0
The connection to multiplication is	Five times three equals 15	4.0
Everybody say were proud of you Avery	Were proud of you Avery	0.0
I forgot who else I called	Liam	0.0
I said its right but how did you get it	Five times three equals 15 and automatically that one fifth of 15 is three	4.0
So knowing the connection between multiplication what would you say the connection is between multiplication and unit fraction of problems	So lets say like this part is	0.0
You can use that green marker you can use any expo marker	So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	4.0
So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	Then so this  you divide up here	4.0
Then so this  you divide up here	You have to know what the easy problems are first	0.0
You have to know what the easy problems are first	If you cant think of something easy then you can go to something	0.0

The rule is 23 thats not a unit fraction so what was your step	My step first was to find the unit fraction of each of the numbers and then multiply that by two	4.0
So whats onethird of nine Brendan	Three	3.0
One third of nine is three and then we multiply	By two	3.0
by two and get	Six	3.0
Six	Six	1.0
So how did that help you here on the 12	I did and then you put the same thing find out 13 of 12 is 4 so then 4  2 is 8	4.0
Yes my dear	On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	3.0
On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	No	0.0
No	Oh yes 3 2 is 6 so then I would have to do 2  2 and I know thats 4	4.0
So my friends if you have finished numbers three and four please move on to five and six but Miss Kay and I are coming around to check number four	Im done	0.0
Then you may move on to five and six	That would be seven and six	0.0
That would be seven and six	Four times six	3.0
Four times six	Yes	0.0
Yes	Four times	3.0
So the first thing did you figure out what those are	Those are	0.0
Those are	No	0.0
You dont remember	Because if I did it and youre looking over here its never	0.0
and you got	24	3.0
Hmm	Is it wrong too	0.0
Im asking you to share your thoughts	I got seven and I just multiplied it by three	3.0
How did you 15 right here	Because originally four times five is 20 multiplying five times  all that	4.0
Were you able to finish  here	Not quite yet	0.0
Oh I love how you started 14 of eight	Its like youre getting that	0.0
Its like youre getting that	He was yelling	0.0
Youve got it	I knew it	0.0

If I win  teacher  said that	I would be a snitch	0.0
Im not going tell you now	Shes just telling us	0.0
Shes just telling us	Well Im not going help you with that one	0.0
Check that one again	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Well what do you want	0.0
Well what do you want	I dont like the	0.0
I dont like the	I knew seven times four equals to 28 so I did this 24	4.0
Good job	what hes saying that you dont need the board	0.0
Have you finished math boxes	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	It doesnt give you the answer really	0.0

Okay Adrianna	Analyze these numbers 7568 and 955	0.0
Analyze these numbers 7568 and 955	Write a number that has a nine and that is onetenth the value of the nine in the number and eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	0.0
Byron	Analyze	3.0
Whats another one  Byron	Write	3.0
Allison	Prove	3.0
You want to analyze it and analyze means what	Focus on it and look closely	3.0
All right so lets look at this so we can all see this together	Ms  does this	0.0
Frankie what did your team say needs to happen to the eight	They said it needs to be switched around to the ninth place	3.0
They said it needs to be switched around to the ninth place	But they said they need to be switched around	3.0
Eight and nine need to be switched	Yes	0.0
Did your team say why they think that	No	0.0
Collin what did your team say	They said that youre supposed to switch the nine and the eight so the ninth to the 10th space then  by one	4.0
Are they saying to keep it in the tenth place	No	0.0
Okay so you think Which five the first five or the second five	The ninth	3.0
Andrea	The eight needs to go to where the six is	3.0
The eight needs to go to where the six is	Because	0.0
I need to know why its going there Jared	Because when they said eight has to go ten times the value of where the eight is so it would be going up a place	4.0
Adrianna what do you want to add on	It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	4.0
It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	That means you would have to do 8 x 10 so that would be 80 and 80 would be in the tenth place	4.0
Damien	It says Write a number that has nine and that 110 is not a full number so youre not going forward you have to go backwards	4.0
If you multiply a whole number by a fraction	Its going to be	0.0
Its going to be what	Its going to be a hundredths	3.0
3281595 does that number fit the rule	Where does three come from	2.0
You could have switched numbers that would have been fine too just like whoever told me to put Was it Catalina	Yes	0.0
Heres what I would say in a problem like this even if you had multiple nines as long as you have a nine in the hundredth  as your Ms Carroll I dont know if that tells me that you fully understand	Well except theres an eight	3.0
Well except theres an eight	It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	1.0
It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	Nine	3.0
Nine	Nine nine nine eight eight eight	0.0
Allison lets hear yours	My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	4.0
My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	Then if you switch the eight with the six in 7568 that is how I got 7586595	4.0
I understand that she gets it but she didnt say why	If she would have said The reason I put it there was because it said that it should be 10 times more so 8 x 10 is 80 which would make it get put in that place	4.0
Adrianna lets hear yours	You want me to do the answers first	0.0
I want you to read your explanation	I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	4.0
I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	What I did with the nine is I made it go to the 100th place because it says nine  is 110 the value so I would make the nine go in the one hundredth	4.0
I dont know she might have	I dont get Never mind	0.0
I got the final answer of 3281595	Thats because there was another 10	4.0
Adrianna	If I multiplied 10 by eight would that be sort of three I guess	4.0
Yes I think the only thing you were missing did you restate	No of course I didnt	0.0
Then did you use transition words	Probably not	0.0
Probably not	I used transition words	0.0
So write a number	Do you want us to explain it to	0.0
Ally what did you write	I wrote zero	3.0
Is it okay to write this	Yes	0.0
Is it okay to write this	No	0.0
Is it okay to write this	No	0.0
Austin what did you write	I wrote zero and seven	3.0
What place is that zero and seven	Tenths	3.0
Brian what did you write	310	3.0
hi whatd you write	I wrote 0 and 8 80100	3.0
Whats this word	And	3.0
Can I leave it like that	No	0.0
No	yes	1.0
Why can we do that Tom	Because its whole  is not like 3400 where it has another	4.0
Im not understanding that	It basically has this  whole number and its not	3.0
Thats a whole number	Not a whole number but basically I dont know how to explain it but basically	3.0
Are you saying yes I can write it that way	Yes	0.0
Read that to me as a number	Thatd be zero and 810	3.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
Cameron what did you write	63100	3.0
Is there any other way to write that	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	is trying to draw my desk	0.0
Cole what did you write for five 5100	Zero and	3.0
Will you tell me literally whats write zero point		3.0
Do you agree with Cole	Yes	1.0
Anyone disagree with Cole	No	1.0
Do we have any tenths when theres five	008	3.0
Do you agree with Zach	Yes	1.0
Then nine hundredths as a fraction Rob	Nine over this	3.0
Over what		3.0
Anyone do it differently or have something to add on to what Sophia said	No	0.0
Hannah what did you do	Instead of changing the 450 to 45 I left at 450	3.0
You left it at that	Since yesterday when we did those multiplication problems because  zero	4.0
Or did you just think it through	I did write	3.0
What did you write as your equation	9 g450	4.0
Is that what Im understanding	Yes	0.0
Ally	I did the house and I did 450 divided by 9 equals 50	4.0
What did you think of	I thought of basic fact	3.0
Where did you write your 50	On my  house	3.0
Did you put your five above the four above the five or above the zero	Above the five	3.0
Do you know why you did that	Because that	0.0
What number are we dividing		3.0
Are you so excited	Yes	0.0
All right Im going to put up a blank page real quick and were going to do two practice problems before you start	When do we start	0.0
Jaden what does area mean	The inside of the rectangle	3.0
Jaden	The measurement of that side is  its 50 because the top side 50 and the bottom side has to be 50	4.0
Can we assume a rule that opposite sides of rectangles are equal	Yes	0.0
Theo give me an equation I can use	You could use	0.0
Do you want me to write the formula up there for area to help you remember	you could have a equals	3.0
You just use this part and this part what parts missing		3.0
Charlie what is should I be thinking of as my basic fact	Five	3.0
Five times something gives me		3.0
Were going to pretend thats not there were going to pretend		3.0
What is it	Four	3.0
Does that make sense to you all now that youre seeing it over and over	Yes	0.0
Okay Fletcher	Do you  like if you dont know about the 4  there is one 50 and another 50	3.0
Is this worth 50	No	0.0
No	The top	3.0
Oh	So if you have a 50 on the top  50 times 4 is equals 200	4.0
Could you do 5 50s and make sure 50	Yes	0.0
Pardon me Ally	You have to  and then you put one right here	3.0
Youre having four	Thats because two times four is	3.0
50 50 50 50 50	Yes	0.0
Are you ready to try it on your own	Yes	0.0
Do we want one more practice	No	0.0
		0.0
	Oh 193	0.0
When we were doing write a decimal for a fraction or a fraction for a decimal is that what youre talking about	No no	0.0
When we did the area of 450 and one side was 9	Area of	0.0
Youre asking me what now	Would	0.0
Youre asking if I did 200 divided by 50	No	0.0
No	100 divided	3.0
Why 100	Because then you could split this in half	4.0
Good thinking	Excuse me	0.0
What dont you get	I need to	0.0
Okay what are we working on	Area	3.0
Instead of doing  equals  We will do this times this	No	0.0
No	Were going to do this one first	3.0
Were going to put equal here	Lets just do the next one	0.0
Lets just do the next one	No I did it	1.0
No I did it	Theres two equal	3.0
Theres two equal	Oh	0.0
Oh	All we have to do is   one down	1.0
Youll have to figure 9 times what is going to give you		3.0
	Wait no	0.0
Wait no	Start with 400	3.0
Start with 400		3.0
They gave you the width   Just replace	1400 divided by two	3.0
1400 divided by two	700 divided by two	1.0
700 divided by two	come down here let me catch up with you	0.0
come down here let me catch up with you	No wait	0.0
No wait	No	0.0
No	Lets start with 400	3.0
Lets start with 400	Here stop	0.0
Here stop	200 and then 500  then it would be	3.0
Lets just renew our learning intention like we did together please	Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with some unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	0.0
Ready do	Siena was the one who taught me how to multiply fractions in fourth grade now Im going to make her teach me how to divide fractions	0.0
Siena was the one who taught me how to multiply fractions in fourth grade now Im going to make her teach me how to divide fractions	Why	0.0
Why	She knows how to do both and Im going to make her teach me	0.0
Max	Its because we need a	0.0
Who was your partner	Cooper and Sheila	0.0
No just give an idea	Because were learning this so which is can kind of	0.0
Why is it in the real world that we would need to do this	Were doing this because lets say in the real world you dont have what  youre saying like you dont have the same Theyre too different	0.0
Were doing this because lets say in the real world you dont have what  youre saying like you dont have the same Theyre too different	Like	0.0
Are SS fractions that we add and subtract going to have the same common denominators	No	0.0
We just now SS said not SS fractions that were adding and subtracting have the same denominators so why do you have to find a common denominator	So it is easier to just subtract them	4.0
Why do you not necessarily totSSy agree with that Hunter	I lost it	0.0
What	I lost my answer	0.0
SS right Marcus is going to explain the relMaureennce of this to us	We said that my team thinks that it be easier to add and subtract it when you have a common denominator with it	3.0
Hunter is it just easier or do you have to have a common denominator	Me and Clyde said its sort of a little bit of both	3.0
Me and Clyde said its sort of a little bit of both	Its a little bit because you have to have a common denominator	3.0
Common read it with me	Finding fractions that are the same	0.0
I said think about when we say we have something in common like Nikeel and I were talking this morning about our pets and what was going on with your dog	He was sleeping on me and I had to get up and it was super hard	0.0
Hes as big as you are practicSSy right	Yes	0.0
It was more a mental guilt for me but did we have that in common that our pets wanted to sleep with us	Yes	0.0
Do we have to have that in common	No	0.0
Some of you are going This doesnt relate to me at SS but for fractions we keep saying they have to have this common denominator that means that denominator has to be	Equal	3.0
Equal	Equal	1.0
I like the way you keep going to equal or another word would that will be	Same	3.0
Same	Equivalent	1.0
Lets read what it says about unlike ready go	For fractions to be unlike they have to have different numbers in the denominator	0.0
Royce	They have different denominators and if you look on the picture theyre different size box for onesixth and onetwelfth	4.0
Lets read this	I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	0.0
River can you explain to us how you got zero	I got zero because I know onefourth is equivalent to threetwelfths and it would equal zero anyway because onefourth is smSS and threetwelfths is also smSS so if you round its going to be anywhere close to zero	4.0
Cooper	What me and Nikeel said we said that onefourth is between zero and onehalf then if youre subtracting threetwelfths from that onefourth its going to be closer to zero because youre already in the half and if youre subtracting its going to be closer to zero	4.0
Again you are going to talk with your face partner gain and partner A starts to explain their thinking	Onehalf minus anything would be closer to one	3.0
Cooper B can you explain your thinking please	I said a one whole because if you do onethird to onehalf its only a way because of a little bit smSS	4.0
I said a one whole because if you do onethird to onehalf its only a way because of a little bit smSS	I took only a little bit more than one whole and since its over one whole	4.0
Cooper do you want to approach	Yes	0.0
Can you explain your picture or your model to your face partner and Ive lost count I think its partner	B	0.0
Lets have Cooper explain his thinking using the model youve drawn on the board	Yes	0.0
Lets give him a round of applause	I said one because if you take one third and put it on a half its not the same size there is still a little bit more leftover but there is one sixth left over and thats more than a whole	4.0
I said one because if you take one third and put it on a half its not the same size there is still a little bit more leftover but there is one sixth left over and thats more than a whole	There is nothing above a whole	4.0
There is nothing above a whole	There is not another benchmark upon the whole so I said one	4.0

Hunter	Me and my partner Gary said that so we were solving addition and subtraction problems that today we were solving common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions	3.0
How like the skill of knowing that my answer is closer to zero number one help me with this	Are we supposed to find equivalent fractions	3.0
Charlie	Me and Paulina said its kind of like an estimate so like when youre solving and you find an equivalent fraction when you find your actual answer and you can use it to check your work and its kinda realistic	3.0
How was your answer different than what you just heard Charlie say	Its because she said it was an estimate and youre supposed to do the estimate and then find the answer and check your work but I said just to find equivalent fractions and to solve equations	1.0
Charlie	Do you have assignment where  game	0.0
Whatever you	Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	3.0
Lets say it again	Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	1.0
Sheila tell everybody what you figured out	BasicSSy what youre doing is youre doing 2x24 and then 3x26t	3.0
What were you doing there Sheila	What I was doing is basicSSy youre multiplying it by two	3.0
Youre multiplying the numerator	And the denominator by two	3.0
What do we know the rule is when you multiply a number by one	Same thing	3.0
Are you changing that number	No	0.0
Popcorn it out whats one way you can prove it	Divide	3.0
What do you mean by that	You could see if that number Well maybe multiply that number that fraction you originSSy had to see if it got one of those fractions	3.0
Should you be working on your idea	No	0.0
No youre looking at their thinking	The way to do it you have the onefourth you could get a straight line then look down	3.0

Thank you	We have four sixths and two thirds	4.0
We have four sixths and two thirds	If youre ever needing to add them you can see youre trying to add them	4.0
If youre ever needing to add them you can see youre trying to add them	You can see that it takes two sixths to make one third	4.0
You can see that it takes two sixths to make one third	To get to this you would multiply a third like with the same thing on the top and the bottom by two and that would be You can see that they are equal because you have twothirds equals to four sixths because it takes four sixths to get two thirds	4.0
Can you prove another there for us	Yes	0.0
Should we be building right now	No	0.0
No	equals to three because if you multiply if you do onefourth times two you get two eighths and if its two divided by two eighths If you switch two eighths with a half you get one fourth	4.0
Im confused	One fourth multiplied by two is two eighths	4.0
Do you want to go work on this and come back	Yes	0.0
I was just reminding you when youre multiplying whats our old saying	Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	3.0
Wherever youre at	Stay there	0.0
See this subtraction symbol in the final answer	Yes	0.0
Thank you	The way that I figured it out was if I divide it by two it will be onefourth multiplied by two and you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two which would equal to eight	4.0

It is difficult because	It is difficult because	0.0
Why is it difficult Wendy	Because you cant automaticSSy say Well one half plus one half is one	4.0
Because you cant automaticSSy say Well one half plus one half is one	You have to use multiple strategies and to check your work and find common denominators	4.0
Elijah	Its difficult because theyre not the same denominator and you wont know	4.0
Its difficult because theyre not the same denominator and you wont know	If its three sixths plus onefourth or onefourth minus three sixths or something like that its difficult because you have to figure out a common denominator for it	4.0
If its three sixths plus onefourth or onefourth minus three sixths or something like that its difficult because you have to figure out a common denominator for it	Theyre not equivalent at first	4.0
Theyre not equivalent at first	Denominators are different so its harder because theyre bigger fractions and theres smSSer fractions of each other	4.0
Denominators are different so its harder because theyre bigger fractions and theres smSSer fractions of each other	Its a less efficient way with different denominators as well because you have to get fraction circles and actuSSy work a long time to actuSSy be able to figure out the right answer	4.0

How many long ones do we have to do	Two	3.0
After that how many boxes are we going to color next with a different color	Four boxes	3.0
Now this one we didnt have any ittybitty tiny ones but this one we do	Eight	3.0
Were going to do eight ittybitty ones	Itty bitty lines	3.0
See thats two	The lines	0.0
Okay	The first one	3.0
Which is		3.0
Okay	The first one	3.0
Okay	First one	3.0
First one	First one	1.0
First one	The first one	1.0
The first one	The first one	1.0
The first one	The first one	1.0
The first one	First one	1.0
First one	Second one	1.0
Second one	Second one	1.0
The three or the two	Three	3.0
Okay so on the alligator mouth which decimal is bigger were going to put the alligator mouth facing the 34	Honestly what I learned about fractions  What I learned about fractions is that sometimes throughout the year the smaller number is sometimes the bigger number	4.0
Honestly what I learned about fractions  What I learned about fractions is that sometimes throughout the year the smaller number is sometimes the bigger number	Because just now 34 was bigger than 248	4.0
Because just now 34 was bigger than 248	Smaller it is I guess bigger it is	4.0
If I add a zero there okay so how did we know that this one was bigger	Because of do you want strike that	0.0
No I want you to tell me why	Oh because	0.0
Shes telling us what we should write	Well so I think what we should write is that 34 zero decimal wait how else we say that	3.0
This is thirty four hundred	Oh yes 34hundredths is bigger than 248thousandths because when we wrote down on the grades it showed that there was three rows and	4.0
Oh yes 34hundredths is bigger than 248thousandths because when we wrote down on the grades it showed that there was three rows and	the The second grade that we did was two rows of boxes and a row of tinny boxes but even thought that the second number is bigger the first number was Even though the second number is bigger the 248 is bigger than 34 then in on decimalwise 34 was bigger than 248	3.0
Right so	Thats a lot to write but	0.0
The three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths of 24thousandths	It is bigger than what	2.0
It is bigger than what	Than the tenths	3.0
Okay so the three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths	tenths of	0.0
This time well start with Dangelo and well go this way	Wait what	0.0
Which one is bigger than the one and the two tenths or 25hundredths	Wait can you come back soon I want to do it on here	0.0
Leahs going to start	I think the first one now	3.0
Lets start	but the  is there	0.0
but the  is there	I think the second one	3.0
I think the second one	I think the second one	1.0
I think the second one	I think the first one is more involved	1.0
I think the first one is more involved	I think the first one	1.0
I think the first one	The first one	1.0
The first one	The first one	1.0
The first one	The second one	1.0
The second one	The first one	1.0
The first one	I think the second one	1.0
I think the second one	The first one	1.0
The first one	I think the second one	1.0
I think the second one	Okay	0.0
Okay so on my grid for the first one Im going to have to color one whole because it has one and two tenths so this is just one and then the other one is 20	So the whole box	3.0
The first one has a whole box and then part of the box and then this one just has two more	Speaker 2 This got the whole box	0.0
Write that first	so do you know	0.0
Okay so right here Cardo were doing this one right here	Is it	0.0
Is there any that are bigger than any others	One	3.0
Okay when you have that done you can hand it to me okay because I want to look at it and make sure youre doing it right	The thing is the biggest numbers	3.0
Okay with that you can go back to your seat	Is it okay that first off why did you Then you offered here	0.0
Way to go everybody say that number	32	3.0
Okay everybody say this	72	3.0
Hudson	Its 72 because if we look at the five five or more you have to round up	4.0
Its 72 because if we look at the five five or more you have to round up	So youre	0.0
What place value do I look at	Im looking at the hundredths place and its a five so you have to round	4.0
Why do you have to round up if its a five	Oh	0.0
Oh	I was looking at the tenths place and then if you look to the hundredths place you know that you have to round up because five or more	4.0
So anything coupling in between you round up to the next place value	I knew that you would round off the one in the tenths place will become a two so it will be 72	4.0
Round	882186 to the nearest hundredths	3.0
You read this one with me	98137 to the nearest thousandths	3.0
Lets read that rounded number now	9814	3.0
Roge	The purpose of doing this is if you had to estimate something you could round that up to make an estimate	3.0
You know the meaning of rounding up right	Or rounded up	0.0
Why make an estimate Andrea	Because it helps you add or subtract better	4.0
In what ways	Because they could be equivalent	4.0
What do you mean	Like it couldnt be easier because itd be closer to a number	4.0
Vicki	Probably to	0.0
You guys will help Mr Oliver today right	Yes	0.0
What is a unit fraction Charlie	A unit fraction its a fraction thats got one unit	3.0
A unit fraction its a fraction thats got one unit	Its usually got one is the numerator	3.0
Its usually got one is the numerator	If youve got a whole were using 14 as an example	3.0
If youve got a whole were using 14 as an example	If you take 14 thats one unit as a whole	3.0
Real quickly	I can discuss and apply strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers	0.0
What does a strategy mean Asher	A strategy like a way of doing things	3.0
Is it going to be a mixed number	No	0.0
Did you finish your math message	Yes	0.0
Whats another strategy Roge	The strategy I used was I would do 5 15 and 5 20	4.0
The strategy I used was I would do 5 15 and 5 20	Since I know my math facts I know that 5 315	4.0
Since I know my math facts I know that 5 315	So thats the strategy I used	4.0
You want to connect to that Margo	I agree with	1.0
I agree with	I would love to add on	1.0
I would love to add on	Kind of like proving the problem backwards in a way	4.0
Kind of like proving the problem backwards in a way	Because you have your number 2 15 and then you getting your answer	4.0
Because you have your number 2 15 and then you getting your answer	You technically multiplying your answer by 15	4.0
You technically multiplying your answer by 15	Here	0.0
Here	Youre just kind of going backwards moving out to the end	3.0
But just showing you two different ways of doing it right	Yes	0.0
Roge would it be the same for both	Me and my partner said it would be the same	3.0
Me and my partner said it would be the same	Because youre doing the same	3.0
Lets have Rebecca go for first	Well I think it would be the same	3.0
Well I think it would be the same	Because multiplying it by 15 is pretty much the same as dividing it by five	4.0
Because multiplying it by 15 is pretty much the same as dividing it by five	Because youre splitting the larger number into five equal groups	4.0
Because youre splitting the larger number into five equal groups	Yes	0.0
Thats why theyre both the inner	Yes	0.0
Now you get a chance to say that	Its the same as saying 15	3.0
Multiplying by 15	by five youre just breaking it into five different parts	3.0
Jodie	because we think it would be because 15  15 would be the same thing as 1 divided by 5  35 would be the same as 3 divided by 5	4.0
Andrew	What we did is we used a unit fraction to find Just to find the regular one and then we did times the numerator so we can see if 35 of 15	4.0
What do you mean by regular one	I mean like when you do the whole number times the unit fraction is kind of like	3.0
Thank you	the whole number	3.0
We want to say you divide the whole number	Divide the denominator of the rule then you take that number and multiply it by the numerator	3.0
Is it always going to be a rule number	No	0.0
Whats it going to be	Its going to be like the thing youre multiplying it by	3.0
Whats the thing that were multiplying by today	Fractions	3.0
Do you see your three fix ups	Yes	0.0
Look at your work and modify as needed	They said multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	1.0
Now read it again	Multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	3.0
Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction and then by the denominator of the fraction	the denominator	3.0
Everybody have the rule written down now	Yes	0.0
Read the directions for A with me	Solve the problem by thinking about 23 of 13	0.0
Solve the problem by thinking about 23 of 13	Show your work	0.0
Now read B	Solve the problem by thinking about 23 as 2 divided by 3	0.0
Solve the problem by thinking about 23 as 2 divided by 3	Show your work	0.0
Were thinking hard	I used the strategy number one	3.0
Thank you	I know that the strategy number one  how to divide and then you have to multiply	4.0
I know that the strategy number one  how to divide and then you have to multiply	First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was	4.0
First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was	Then we have one whole leftover	4.0
Then we have one whole leftover	We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	4.0
We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	4.0
Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	Then I got my answer 8 and 23	4.0
Go again those of us that are  more time can look at it	First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction	4.0
First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction	I was able to split it into four whole groups	4.0
No I dont see how thats four whole groups	If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction	4.0
If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction	You would have three	4.0
I see the three groups as the three columns	Yes	0.0
Theres four in each group of three	Yes and each one of these would be part of	3.0
Can you show us the three groups	This is one group	3.0
Thank you	Two groups and three groups	3.0
Thank you	Then for each group you would have a third with the group as well	3.0
Thats the 13th one	Yes	0.0
Thank you	Then put two of those you would have eight thats eight full  and then two thirds	4.0
Now Marcuss explaining the division part	I used strategy one and divided the whole number by three as the denominator of the fraction	3.0
I used strategy one and divided the whole number by three as the denominator of the fraction	That was	0.0
Are guys okay with that	Yes	0.0
Todd	I think it would be a silly mistake	3.0
Daria	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	Im	0.0
Im	If one denominator is a multiple of the other	0.0
If one denominator is a multiple of the other	If it is it is also a common denominator	0.0
Okay Im going to have you use this because Im seating two feet from you and I cannot hear you	Making a list of improper fractions	0.0
Were on the third one	Multiply by two or  product as a common denominator	0.0
Joey	My partner said Well we both said pretty much the same thing	1.0
My partner said Well we both said pretty much the same thing	and then you add it to the numerator	3.0
Luis what was your estimate and how did you find it	Half	3.0
Lets speak in a complete sentence My estimate was	My estimate was half because	3.0
How did you solve that mentally like that	I did	0.0
If you find the answer first and then estimate are you really estimating	No	0.0
Bailey	I know that	0.0
Okay and then what did you do to get your answer of half	I know that to get to half	0.0
The estimate of a half	I know two	3.0
Peyton share your thinking	I got one because	3.0
What did I say you could not do	Add them	3.0
If you didnt add them first how would you know that the answer is going to be close to one	Because they all have the same denominator and	4.0
Share your thinking Cooper	I agree but not really because you didnt really explain	1.0
How did you get the estimate of one	I looked at the denominator and	3.0
Cooper	The numerator	3.0
Brett can you explain how you got your answer its okay just explain	I got eight ninths	4.0
I got eight ninths	I got eight ninths because firstly I did all the numerators so 4  3  7 and 7  1  8	4.0
I got eight ninths because firstly I did all the numerators so 4  3  7 and 7  1  8	Then the denominator stays the same so the eight ninths	4.0
I have eight slices do I have almost a whole pizza	No	0.0
Maya share your thinking	You can add the second problem in your head and not the first one because the second problem had the same denominators so you could just add it but the first problem had unlike denominators so you have to go through the whole process to get a common denominator	4.0
Anna what did you notice about that problem	The denominators is	3.0
sit down listen	and whoever added this and the denominator is	4.0
Okay and is that wrong or right class	Wrong	1.0
Remy	Im thinking that actually out the	0.0
Right and remember if a complete sentence we say its	Because	0.0
Because so can you rephrase that	Yes	0.0
What do the denominators do class	Stay the same	3.0
Cooper can you read that second question starting with the word how	How would estimation help the person to solve this problem	0.0
Okay Red Robin	No	0.0
How would estimation help	Estimation would help to see if your estimation is closer to your answer	3.0
Bailey	That person can see if they did it wrong	3.0
Let s think what is one 13 closest to boys and girls zero half or one	Zero	3.0
Zero	Half	1.0
Bailey would you like to keep going	Yes	0.0
Would this answer be bigger than one	Yes	0.0
Yes because 56 is almost a whole and then you guys just told me that 13 is closer to a half so thats going to push it over and be bigger than one is that answer bigger than one	No	0.0
Okay heres the deal when we did this how many multiples did we typically find	Five	3.0
Reese can you please read step three	Find the equivalent fraction using the lowest common multiple	3.0
But what did I multiply that by	You do both fractions	3.0
Do you remember what did we do Madison	We had a box	3.0
Okay where did 66 come from	I dont know	3.0
Whats the denominator of that fraction	Six	3.0
Do I need to do anything to it	No	0.0
Our problem was 56 right	Yes	0.0
Our new was 26 right	Yes	0.0
Class what do I write	56	3.0
Now I add whats two plus five	Seven	0.0
We originally said this was 76 right	Yes	0.0
Julia why eight and 16 instead of one and 16	Since the top one is bigger than the bottom you add the seven plus another one	4.0
You guys already showed and talked	Yes	0.0
What number are you guys on	Eight	0.0
Is this the right one	Yes	0.0
Youre sure	Yes	0.0
Todd	You can help him	0.0
Make sense	No	0.0
Liam tell me what you came up with	210 315 420 525	3.0
What did you do	By doing 1  1	3.0
You added	Yes I did	0.0
What did you do on the bottom	I counted by 5	3.0
What did he do to get 210 and 315	He added	1.0
He added what	I didnt hear	0.0
Adding ones at the top but counting by fives at the bottom	Yes	1.0
Katie does that make sense to you	Yes a little bit	1.0
Will that work with all fractions	No	0.0
Why does it work when we have a one at the top	Because one is a factor of everything	4.0
What did you say Maddox	Because one is a factor of everything	4.0
Okay Stephan	What I do is I multiplied 2 2 times and I got 4	4.0
What I do is I multiplied 2 2 times and I got 4	And then I added by 4 2 times and I got 8	4.0
Did you get another one	I multiplied 2 x 3 and I got 6	4.0
I multiplied 2 x 3 and I got 6	Then I multiplied 4 x 3 and I got 12	4.0
He started here	You multiply 2 x 4	1.0
Two times		3.0
What would you multiply 2 by to get 6		3.0
2 x 4 is 8	Oh	0.0
Oh	2 x 3	3.0
Also		1.0
Bryce whatd you end up doing	I got 4 out of 6 and 6 out of 9 by doing what was	4.0
So you did multiples of 2	Mmhmm	0.0
So when you started listing your multiples you need 2 4 6	Yes	0.0
Why did Bryce do multiples	Everything multiple because its like youre doing the same number	4.0
Everything multiple because its like youre doing the same number	Its not the same number but its equivalent to the number	4.0
Taylor whatd you get as equivalent	120	3.0
How did you get 820	I did 2 x 4 and then 2 x 10	4.0
Jamie	1230	3.0
Rob whatd you get	12 x 2  24 and 3 x 2  6	4.0
So 624	And 12 x 4 is 48 and 3 x 4 is 12	4.0
So just doing the number	A book here in the office	0.0
Caleb talk to me	I switched the 120200	3.0
You did what	Wait no no no	0.0
Wait no no no	That was not 1620	3.0
You were doing the one below	Yes	0.0
1620 tell me how you got that	I multiplied 8 x 2 I got 16	4.0
I multiplied 8 x 2 I got 16	Then I did 10 x 2 and I got 20	4.0
Then I did 10 x 2 and I got 20	And then I got 2430	4.0
Explain that one	I multiplied 8 x 3 and then 10 x 3	4.0
Jade did you do 68	Yes I did	0.0
Yes I did	So I got 1216	3.0
Explain please	I looked at the my multiplication table and I got the 12 and then I did the 8 the same way	4.0
What is that called when youre using your multiplication chart to help you	I dont know whats it called	0.0
You found the	I found the product	3.0
Making your numbers bigger	Multiples	3.0
What was another equivalent fraction	1824	3.0
Maddox	Another one for	0.0
You got one here	One	3.0
What	I thought you Never mind	0.0
Oh you were going for a different one	Yes	0.0
Katie whatd you get for 25100	One is 50200	4.0
One is 50200	Then I got 75300	4.0
Howd you do those	I did 25 x 2 which equals 50	4.0
I did 25 x 2 which equals 50	Then 100 x 2 which is 200	4.0
Then 100 x 2 which is 200	Then I multiplied one more to 25 to get to 75	4.0
Then I multiplied one more to 25 to get to 75	Same with the 200 to get to 300ths	4.0
Nobody at this middle table did any math	No	0.0
Anyone at this middle table do any math here	We did	0.0
All right Caleb tell me what you did	I did 120200	3.0
Why did you do that	Because I multiplied 60 x 2	4.0
Because I multiplied 60 x 2	I got 120 and then I did 100 x 2	4.0
I got 120 and then I did 100 x 2	Then	0.0
You have another one	Yes	0.0
Yes	I got 180300	4.0
I got 180300	I did that by doing 60 x 3 and 100 x 3	4.0
Did anyone reduce this down to a smaller fraction	What	0.0
What	Uhuh	0.0
What do you think Sophie	Maybe 610	3.0
If you colored in 60 little cubes out of the 100 how many of those would be tenths	Six	3.0
Katie	Its not a question but I have another I think for 60100	3.0
What	6001000	3.0
Yes so that would be making it grow bigger	Okay	0.0
All right how many of you used your faction circles to help you figure out what piece the third would be if you had three of them	Oh I got a circle	3.0
Show me on your fraction circle what that would be	Yes I didnt have a fraction circle so I did this	3.0
What shape is that	Half circle	3.0
What color is our half circle	Pink	3.0
Pink	White	1.0
What does the denominator or the bottom number tell you	The whole number	3.0
We want this one	The tenths	3.0
Take out your purple pieces	These arent purple	0.0
There should be four or five  Did everybody find their purple pieces	Yes	0.0
Is that more or less than what you just had with your light blue pieces	Less	3.0
Stephan why is this onefourth fraction less than this onethird fraction	Its not even to like a half a circle because its missing the orange	4.0
Avery does that work	Yes	0.0
Is there one single piece thats going to work	Yes	0.0
Do we have anything in between a pink and an orange	No	0.0
Katie what did you try	Two fifths	3.0
Are we really doing the whole as a full circle right now	No	0.0
What is the whole Katie	Two fifths	3.0
Two colors	Two greens	3.0
I wish there were a better tool for us to use than these paper ones that weve got cut out because theyre not very easy to work with	I wish the foam ones	0.0
Yes I wish we all had enough foam ones to use	Theyre easier to place together	0.0
Alice	You add it to other thirds too	3.0
I added together a third plus a third plus a third what did I end up with	Threethirds	3.0
Threethirds or whats that also called	A whole	3.0
I should have how many altogether	Four	3.0
I dont know see if that works	No you cant	3.0
Could I swap it out for a green	Yes	0.0
Josh tell me which number you want me to do with you today	Number two	0.0
What color piece do we need	Green	3.0
Aaron that tells me that light green needs how many totals to make the whole	That numerator says one	3.0
One and my denominator tells me how many to get to the whole thing	Four	3.0
So how many light greens should you take out	Four	3.0
This is onefourth and what did I add together	The fourth	3.0
Whats this one worth	One	3.0
Onefourth plus	Onefourth	3.0
What does that equal	Fourfourths	3.0
All right Caleb what piece did you find that is an equivalent for that whole	Fives	3.0
What color	Orange	3.0
Maddox	It could be that or also could be two of these	3.0
Do you agree with Maddox	Yes	1.0
Katie	Three of the dark blues	3.0
Do you agree with Katie that three dark blues could be the whole	Yes	1.0
Stephan what other number would you like us to do together	Number three	0.0
Number three	All right	0.0
Stephan read that	If one light blue is twothirds what is the whole	0.0
Alice talk to me what are you thinking	Youll take one light blue piece and take a different color like the light purple and then place it on top and see if thats half of it	4.0
what I hear you say	Yes	0.0
Nate what did you hear Alice say	That twothirds is equivalent to one of those	3.0
If this is twothird how she going to figure out what to do How do you know what one of the thirds is if thats two then put them together into one piece	I said that you take the one light blue and then you take one light purple and its half of it then you might find out that thats onethird and so twothirds	4.0
Okay can you now repeat what she said	Yes so one blue is equivalent to two purples	3.0
Sophie what two pieces did you use to fill your one light blue	I used two light greens	3.0
If it were a full circle what now	Onethird	3.0
Have a question about	I agree	1.0
What is your light blue worth	Twothirds	3.0
Why is it that Alice says this is worth onethird	Because it is half of twothirds and you have to use one so it will be onethird	4.0
Okay so I hear you saying that one of these is half of the twothirds and say what you said then	Since its half of that since its half of twothirds  one	4.0
We have our light blue is two thirds how many of these do we need to add to it to get to the whole	One	3.0
Because twothirds plus onethird equals how much	Threethirds	3.0
Luke which one did you find	Yellow	3.0
Its a yellow everyone take your yellow piece out lay it on top of those two is that the same size	Yes	0.0
Partner up figure it out help each other out I want to hear your answers in 15 minutes	Good how are you	0.0
If you have two of these its equal to that so one what	One half	3.0
Nope	One two	3.0
Pam pam param pam	Pam pam	0.0
Pam pam param pam	Pam pam	0.0
Thank you for your quick transitions looking at number one when yellow piece was half of our shape so how many would it take to make the whole thing	Two	3.0
Two of them if I put two of them together what color does that equal	Pink one pink	3.0
If this is 25 Maddox what did you do to figure out what 55 would be	We need 25  the half of 25 so what should be 15	2.0
Avery	Purple	3.0
Whats the whole thing		3.0
What is the whole shape	One pink	3.0
One pink	One yellow	1.0
One yellow	You did the wrong half I thought it was yellow	1.0
Luke	The blue	3.0
The lightblue	Three blues on two yellows	3.0
So if thats 34 how many more of those light blues do I need to make the whole shape	One	3.0
Well do I have anything thats that shape	No	0.0
Do I have one pink and one light blue	Yes	0.0
Please dont freak out about this is no something youre going to have to do very often because do we all carry fraction circles in our pockets	No	0.0
And we want 34 of it to be in white leather and the other 14 in a different color leather	Red	0.0
How did you do it	So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them	4.0
So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them	We put two of the dark blue ones and then one purple	4.0
If you had to name that fraction that would be hard to do wouldnt it	Yeah	0.0
What does product mean in math Olivia	Answer to a multiplication	3.0
Shade the parts of the square for each fraction and show the part that is shaded by both fractions and write a number sentence that shows the area model	So basically what we did yesterday	3.0
That was yesterdays	How did	0.0
How did	Yes we did 57 so	3.0
Laim	Do you want me to	0.0
Do we agree or disagree with what Laim put up here for 23	I agree	1.0
I agree	I agree	1.0
Oliver you want to try it	Sure	0.0
Lets pick a different color	Miss Carroll why would you do those four lines	2.0
Miss Carroll why would you do those four lines	Just like	0.0
So Elijah what is the answer of 23 of 23	Im still confused a little	2.0
Sophia	46	3.0
Not quite	Its nine	3.0
Its nine	Nine	1.0
Im going to put tick marks by what each team says	We came up with 12 x 13	3.0
So you think this ones bigger	Yes	0.0
Yes	Because	0.0
Oh yes tell me why	if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	4.0
if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	But if you do 12 of a 15 it would be 110 and a 16 has a bigger fraction than	4.0
Team Two which one did you pick	We picked 12 x 13 and we picked it because if you do 12 x 13  16  or when you solve the problem you do that	4.0
We picked 12 x 13 and we picked it because if you do 12 x 13  16  or when you solve the problem you do that	Then also when you solve the problem for 12 x 15 it would  110 which is like Oliver said smaller than 16	4.0
Team Three what did you pick	We got 12 x 13	3.0
Why did you pick that one	Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	3.0
Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	So I just did the problem to make sure and	0.0
And this team	We did 12 x 13	3.0
What was your reasoning	Because	0.0
Team 2 can you listen to Team 4 like they listened to you	We did the problem and we found out that it was the 16 and then 4  3 is	4.0
Team Five which one did you pick	12 x 13	4.0
12 x 13	Because we ust kind of estimated 13 is bigger than 13 and 12  12 and so if you look at this  13 is bigger than	4.0
We have to find one of these squares that we can use its going to be divided in fifths and its going to be divided in thirds to show our work	It has to have that five and three or something	3.0
Thats five and five	Not necessary	3.0
All right draw it	Ive realized that we ve only done this with fractions can we use whole numbers	3.0
Your math message yesterday was 23 of 24 remember  of  means what	Multiply	3.0
All right Im going to give you your sheet each person come up with a problem and then solve it and see if as a team youve come up with the same answers for each problem	We each should have five problems	3.0
Right here at the top theres a place to put five problems	Can the team with six people come to	0.0
Yes if you have six maybe go join another team so you can create a problem for them	Got it	0.0
Be with somebody of your team unless somebody is left out	Im out	0.0
Okay about two more minutes	Is it two	0.0
Okay if were going to have time to play cahoot I need you to switch gears	Were going to play again right	0.0
Yes	What do we do	2.0
Were going to play again	Team	0.0
Did everybody answer	No yes	0.0
Another true or false	red	3.0
Okay last one	What What	0.0
What What	What	0.0
What	Last one	0.0
Last one	Were going to win anyway	0.0
Answer is	Down	3.0
Well say less than or greater than one whole	34	3.0
34	Less than	3.0
Claire	Because if you have 36 and 36 then it would be 66	4.0
Because if you have 36 and 36 then it would be 66	If you had 26  36 it would be a 56	4.0
If you had 26  36 it would be a 56	Then we have 36  46 then you would have 76	4.0
When the numerator is seven is greater than six we know its	Greater than a whole	3.0
Answer is	Greater	3.0
Greater	Greater than	1.0
Why do you say greater than Cooper	Because half of 88 is 4	4.0
Because half of 88 is 4	I put two	3.0
Cooper will you start again please	Yes	0.0
Yes	I had 38 and 28 and I put them together to make 58	4.0
I had 38 and 28 and I put them together to make 58	Then 58  48 is 98 which is more than one whole	4.0
Then 58  48 is 98 which is more than one whole	Then I have a question	0.0
Yes my dear	You said	0.0
My dear	is one	3.0
is one	Its one whole	3.0
Its one whole	One whole	3.0
Do you see one where it one whole	No	0.0
Greater than one whole or less than one	You skipped some T2	0.0
The answer is	She already said that shes going to	0.0
She already said that shes going to	Greater than	3.0
Is it greater than or less than one whole	Greater than	3.0
Austin can you tell us why its greater than one whole	I know that 5  5 is 10 and 10 is greater than 8	4.0
108 is greater than one whole	Yes	0.0
Great	Well its usually like	0.0

Are you guys talking right here	Yes	0.0
Okay	Its cool	0.0
Its cool	Its something that happens at the like a pattern that happens	3.0
Its something that happens at the like a pattern that happens	Lets say theres a pattern that happens  you will find something	3.0

Theres a pattern that happens	Thats technology	0.0
Thats technology	Theres a pattern that	3.0
Each number has the same	have to find the same thing	3.0
With an equal amount of space	Yes	0.0
What does that mean and why is that important	I think it means like how many inches they are	3.0
Would you call on the next person for us please	Austin	0.0
Austin	Me and Aiden said that an interval or space between them means the difference or the amount between	3.0
The difference in between the	The numbers in a line plot	3.0
The numbers in a line plot	The unit	3.0
The unit	Student	0.0
Ethan will you add on to that please	Yes I also wanted to share	0.0
Excellent	We both have a bunch of paper and then	0.0
When were talking about interval we want to think about that as an equal or same space between the numbers	Yes between the two of them	3.0
Whats the unit	Inches	3.0
In order from the	Smallest	3.0
To the	Largest	3.0
The line plot shows measurement data in Whats the interval	Half an inch	3.0
Thats tricky isnt it	Yes	0.0
You want to start	I have this one question that goes one has two and one onehalf	3.0
I have this one question that goes one has two and one onehalf	Thats what was confusing	0.0
How many insects were measured	11	3.0
11	20	1.0

Aiden would you be willing to share	I think	0.0
Thank you for starting us	I	0.0
Josh	I counted the top I got 22	3.0
How	I counted the top it came out as 11	3.0
How many points in that set of data was	11	3.0
11	Then the bottom had the exact same number	3.0
Then the bottom had the exact same number	I just added eleven	3.0
Then 11  11 was	22	3.0
Did you do it a little different Paris	What I did was I knew that there were nine and the two inches	4.0
What I did was I knew that there were nine and the two inches	Then a seven in two and a half	4.0
Then a seven in two and a half	I took 3 and I added it to the 7 to get 10 plus the 9 plus the 3 to get 22	4.0
Say it	Three and a half	3.0
Three and a half what	Inches	3.0
Tell your shoulder partner	One and a half	3.0
One and a half what	Inches	3.0
Noah do your	I think its four halves is the differenceone and one half to minimum	3.0
Noah Im hearing you say four halves from one and one half to three and one half	Or two wholes because theyre both that one half and one plus two equals three	4.0
Or two wholes because theyre both that one half and one plus two equals three	Thats how I know its two	4.0
Good thinking	Then I revise my thinking with the	0.0
Our first step to organize and think about the data is to put the measurements in order from what	Smallest to largest	3.0
What is the smallest measurement	3 12	3.0
Do we have any other 3 12	No	0.0
No	Its the only one	3.0
Do we have any 3 34	Yes	0.0
Yes	We have three	3.0
How many times do you see 3 34	Four	3.0
You should write down 3 34 how many times	Four	3.0
Whats our next biggest measurements	4 12	3.0
How many times do we have four inches	Three times	3.0
Then what is our largest piece of data	4 12	3.0
We have to look at the denominator	Was it 4 34	3.0
Was it 4 34	I couldnt	0.0
You have your data on your sheet	I didnt get to write it all down	0.0
I didnt get to write it all down	It goes one half and then	3.0
Friends I want us all to think about if our smallest piece of data is Whats our smallest	3 12	3.0
Our largest is	4 12	3.0
Whats in the middle of three inches and four inches	3 12	3.0
Whats in the middle of four inches and five inches	4 12	3.0
4 12	Is it okay if I did this	0.0
We can place the Xs on our line plot right	Yes	0.0
How many 3 12 did we have	One	3.0
Whats next	3 34	3.0
How many 3 34 did we have	Four	3.0
Four	I thought we had five	1.0
Was there a five	Yes I thought so	0.0
3 34 ones two three four	You need a half	3.0
How many times did four occur in the measurement above	Three times	3.0
Whats the next data point	4 12	3.0

Where did your thinking land Paris	We said 49 would be the smallest and 56 would be the biggest	3.0
49 has the smallest and say it again	56 as the largest	3.0
Paris did you guys talk about interval	Not yet	0.0
Was there any team that talked about an interval	We were confused	0.0
Quarter centimeters	I think we should put them off by half	3.0
Why do you think halves	Actually whole	3.0
Christian would you share the thinking that your team had about the intervals	We thought that we should do half centimeters because most people got half I think and we use centimeters to measure our heads	4.0
Stand up if you have different thinking	About what	2.0
Stand up if you would like to add on or have a different idea or comment about how we should set up our line plot in intervals	Stand up Max	0.0
Max	Can I add	0.0
Yes	I think we should also set up in half centimeters because a lot of the numbers are halves between each of the numbers like 54 and 54 and a half and then 55 and then theres 54	4.0
Cooper you were going to say something similar	I was going to say if we do ones	3.0
Okay	If we do one as the interval were going to skip some because one cant justcut in half interval	4.0
If we do one as the interval were going to skip some because one cant justcut in half interval	That would be a	0.0

Why do we still have to put 49 and a half on it	I thought we were counting all of these on here	0.0
I thought we were counting all of these on here	one half as the interval	3.0
I think the large interval should be 56  because we wont fill it all	Yes were not going to fill it up	0.0
What do these numbers represent	Centimeters	3.0
Good job	I think that should be	0.0
I think that should be	Its the perfect amount	0.0
Its the perfect amount	What about circumference	3.0
You definitely could use the word circumference	Or could we just write centimeters	3.0
I would add the word distance so that you know its not just a straight line because we are looking at the distance around something	T2 you said a 53 5 and a half	0.0
How about that it worked out just perfectly	Just barely perfect	0.0
My friends before we go ahead and complete our line plot what should the title of our line plot be	Circumference	3.0

Can you read this for us please Lyla	I will know when I couldnt do it when I can just successfully use the algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two through seven on page 179	0.0
I will know when I couldnt do it when I can just successfully use the algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two through seven on page 179	Also I can explain how an area model shows one of my answers is correct	0.0
Zane how many parts	Two	3.0
Should you be doodling on your slate	No	0.0
Should you be talking with other people	No	0.0
Lets see whats on that page	We already did that	0.0
Lyla	The dimensions for the shaded rectangle should be 1 x 1	3.0
The dimensions for the shaded rectangle should be 1 x 1	Wait no	3.0
What are the dimensions of this rectangle	26 x 34	3.0
Hes saying it very uncertainly No why would you want to use the tick marks	So you dont have to count what the dimensions are you can just look where the shaded ends where to mark	3.0
See up here if you have those tick marks its really clear where to shade to isnt	Yes	0.0
Zane did you see the relevance of that	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense now	Yes	0.0
What were the tick marks labelled Harley	There were the Xaxis that were labeled 13	3.0
What would the would the one whole potentially be labeled	44	3.0
Haitus	There would be labeled 66	3.0
The whole axis	No the whole axis	0.0
The first tick mark would be	16 26 36 46 56 and 66 or one whole	4.0
I need you to speak up so we can actually hear you	My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is	4.0
My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is	Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24	4.0
Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24	This is  34 by 26 and that explains it	4.0
Elise what are you trying to say	Just a question to ask him	1.0
Just a question to ask him	What would be the width of the shade	2.0
What would be the width of the shade	The width of the shade would be I think 34	3.0
Would that change if you clip it	No	0.0
You said something that was a great modeling for other students because I see some people counting each of those squares theyve count all the squares but you did something can you explain that part again real quick for everybody that didnt catch it	to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four	4.0
to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four	you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent	4.0
Noelle	I think the algorithm is	0.0
Was it going to be an answer to a computation problem	No	0.0
No its not	Itll get you that	3.0
Whats the pattern that you see Gray	The pattern I see is that when you see the multiplication problem like 56 x 14 you tend to do the numerator time the numerator like 5 x 1 but then do the denominator times the denominator 6 x 4 and then when you multiply the numerators you got the numerator of your answer and when you multiply the denominator you got the denominator of your answer which was 524	4.0
Do they follow that rule	Yes	0.0
Does that rule work in each of those instances	Yes	0.0
Aspen	Denominator	3.0
Whats another word that youd like	Algorithm	3.0

I feel like then you should say Then multiply the denominators or	the denominator	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Go ahead and read that for us Dakota	The algorithm for multiplying fractions and fractions is first to multiply the numerator of the two factors	3.0
The algorithm for multiplying fractions and fractions is first to multiply the numerator of the two factors	The answer to that will be the numerator of your product	3.0
The answer to that will be the numerator of your product	Next you multiply both denominators to get the next part of your product	3.0
Okay Cyrus	What I said is the algorithm of multiplying fractions is first you have to multiply both of the numerators to get the new numerator product then you have to multiply both denominators to get the new product then put both of the new products together	3.0
Are we still doing area models	No	0.0
1 x 3 is what	1 x 3 is 3	4.0
2 x 6 is what	2 x 6 is 2 I mean 12	4.0
thats why I got out templates	Yes	0.0
Is that helpful does that matter	Im confused	2.0
Dakota	My team was talking about you would take the denominator of your product and divide it by one of the denominators of the factors and then if you get the denominator of the other factor that you didnt divide your product denominator by you multiply the denominator and you would do the same thing for the numerators	4.0
Harley	If you were finding out half of 34 for example you would probably get  less than what youre finding of 34 and if you get something bigger your algorithm is not correct	4.0
Zane can you read it orthe success criteria  for us	I will know I can do it when I can successfully use an algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two to seven	0.0

Okay which are also called roots and then in the calculator theyre called	Zeros	3.0
What did we discover about anything that has an even power	That it increases like that or its like that it bounces	0.0
It bounces off of the	Xaxis	3.0
So it either bounces off or hangs you know but	Does it touch the Xaxis	3.0
So go	I actually have a question	0.0
I actually have a question	When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	3.0
When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	how to do that	2.0
So its a different	Its pretty much	0.0
Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that	Okay	0.0
Okay	So its up to you	3.0
So its up to you	Thanks	0.0
Thanks	Yes	0.0
Yes	I mean Ill work	0.0
Match it first because then youre going to use the Xintercepts of the graph to write it in factor form	is exactly the intercept	3.0
Yes so do any of these actually bounce off the Xaxis	No but this is	3.0
Right but what we were talking about and let me put that back up for you	How do you put your factor in there	2.0
is when I have a factor thats	When its a factor	3.0
Yes	Isnt B over there	3.0
Isnt B over there	Its rounded out	3.0
Its rounded out	Its rounded out	3.0
Its rounded out	Or theres like actually is figure out	0.0
Well youre going to first match it with the graph	What Im trying to do is Im trying to figure out the intercepts and then I can match it	3.0

I cant split something I dont have you guys are jumping ahead quite a bit yes	You need to label it	3.0
I cant label something I dont have	You have to split both  like this is like a part here and a part here	3.0
I dont have any parts of anything  youre on the right track of what we do but were all forgetting what we did first and emphasizing this because Im sorry to interrupt Rose Im emphasizing this because on your exit slip very few people even tried to use the strategy in the class Maddie	You have to draw a picture	3.0

All right guys page 98	Location principle	3.0
The location principle go ahead Colin tell us what it is	It acts as a polynomial function and A and B are two real numbers such that FMA is less than zero and that would be as greater than zero that F has at least one real zero between A and B	0.0
Thats a lot of math talk for something thats pretty simple were saying that in this particular case our Yvalue is greater than zero so Y is	Positive	3.0
Ive got some Bvalue and a Y this point could be anywhere in this pink area then the same thing is true over here Y is less than zero so Y is	A negative	3.0
Anybody have a question on that or need to hear somebody else explain it	To summarize this segment theres one point between A and B thats where Y is zero	3.0
Yes makes  sense	Oh thats hard to see that theres a zero	0.0
Cooper could you read number one for me please	The graph of every polynomial function of degree N has at most N1 turning points	0.0
The graph of every polynomial function of degree N if I look here whats the degree of this one	Three	3.0
What would 31 be	Two	3.0
Two	Two	1.0
It has two	Turning points	3.0
Thats all this is saying what could the degree of this one be	Four	3.0
Four could be more than that but basically four so 41 is	Three	3.0
One two three turning points	I like this	0.0
In this location I have a minimum and in this location Ive got a minimum as well so we use that term local minimum then over here we have one two three four five	Quintic	3.0
Quintic 51 one two three four turning points and the reason it says at most was because remember something like this could actually look like that	It could still be Quintic	3.0
And still be Quintic	I was going to say couldnt it actually be more than Quantic though couldnt be sextic	3.0
Yes and you have the right idea that its got to be an odd number because its going in different directions	Because your sign is there based on what you have	3.0
Brad could you read number two for us	If a polynomial equation has N	0.0
Zeros means	Xintercept	3.0
How many turning points we have for	Those two go hand in hand because the degree determines	4.0
Only two types of symmetry that were testing Yaxis and about the origin	Why is it called odd or even though	2.0
Why is it called odd or even though	Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function	3.0
Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function	Thats really weird	0.0
I know and but in a certain sense thats also what we thought of with odd and even degrees too though is positive and negative	Yes	0.0
Yes	On average it seems to be the function with odd degrees	3.0
On average it seems to be the function with odd degrees	Well they seem to be tend to be more on the neither side or the odd side at least from what I can tell	3.0
Well they seem to be tend to be more on the neither side or the odd side at least from what I can tell	They seem to have that more capability being	3.0
Page 101 has our essential question and Dante could you read that for me please	How can you find a time on the old model for reallife data	0.0

Step one were going to use our Xintercepts of 4 to create the factor X4	How	2.0
Does my red polynomial have the same Xintercept	Would that be imaginary	3.0
Would that have the same Xintercepts	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes but its a much  function	1.0
What makes the difference	The A	3.0
Yes	When you multiply into standard form do you multiply the set of intercepts by themselves in that A value or do you distribute it or	2.0
If I asked you to do that tell me how to do it	Just go across then okay	3.0
Whats the answer to this going to be or do I do 2x3 and get six and 2x4 and get eight and multiply that together to get 48	Multiply with the 1 2 by the X4 and move that to X times the X1	4.0
I wouldnt want to multiply the 1 2 times an odd number probably	Okay so just multiply them all basically	3.0
Now go back to this one and see if you can figure out how to start	If it is in parentheses I get three and then do I subtract it over or do I divide it over	2.0
Well what are we doing with all of those	We said its equal to zero	3.0
Well actually you said its equal to three	so then do I subtract this over here	3.0
We adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	Multiplying	3.0
Multiplying so multiply them all together and what do you get	3 times A is 3	4.0
Are adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	They are multiplying	3.0
They are multiplying	So  equals X	3.0
So you divide both sides by 3	Then Ill have to write out the whole thing	3.0
Yes	Do we have to do exercises 5 through 8	0.0
so which one of those factors gets squared	X1	0.0

Great so we had a mixed response	After Catherine said it then some kid started the same	1.0
After Catherine said it then some kid started the same	Yes	1.0
Well Daniella said it first	Remember when in the video it said that you can use	0.0
Remember when in the video it said that you can use	If there arent enough numbers since 034 thousandths I mean hundredths you can add a zero and it would be thousands and so 340 is definitely bigger than 248 so thats logic	4.0
If there arent enough numbers since 034 thousandths I mean hundredths you can add a zero and it would be thousands and so 340 is definitely bigger than 248 so thats logic	You can see because in the first number theyre bringing the two	1.0

Lets listen to Derrik	Also in the video it said You would always go for the first number and whichever is bigger you would just ignore the numbers behind it	3.0
Also in the video it said You would always go for the first number and whichever is bigger you would just ignore the numbers behind it	You would just ignore them	3.0
You would just ignore them	The three is bigger than the two so to the three is obviously the one that wins	4.0
The three is bigger than the two so to the three is obviously the one that wins	Im going to change my answer	3.0
After hearing their responses	Yes	0.0
All right so what are you changing it to	I am changing my answer to 34hundredths because like Derrik said in the video you should go for whichever is bigger on the left side basically	4.0
I am changing my answer to 34hundredths because like Derrik said in the video you should go for whichever is bigger on the left side basically	If you add a zero to 34000 hundredths then you get 34thousandths and that is larger than 248thousandths	4.0
In the tenths what do we have	A four and a four	3.0
There we go	a three and a two	3.0
Is the three bigger or the two bigger	Three	3.0
Campbell pass that to Gerard	I get why Campbell thought that it was 248 because the eight is bigger than the zero and the fours are the same but she probably didnt see the three and the two	4.0
Sometimes we think of the zero and we think 248 is bigger than 34	Yes	0.0
Yes	You dont add to it you dont add to the zero	3.0
Hold on Campbells talking	My answer was going to be zero and 248thousandths but then remembering the video I looked a bit closer and I saw that you can make zero and 34hundredths into zero and 34thousandths	4.0
Give it to Derrik	I have a connection with the people that thought it was 248000 thousandths	1.0
I have a connection with the people that thought it was 248000 thousandths	So this one time I was doing the same thing but just with the normal numbers and I thought that 2000 was bigger than 34	4.0
So this one time I was doing the same thing but just with the normal numbers and I thought that 2000 was bigger than 34	I would have been correct but the three was bigger than the two so Id have got that whole thing wrong	4.0

How come you think its 25hundredths	Well at first I thought one was in the tenths and the two was in the hundredths so thats why I thought it was two to 2500 hundredths because I thought the one was in 10th place but then I looked up at the chalkboard and then I saw that was in the ones place	4.0
You agree with the one in 2tenths	I agree with the one in 2tenths	1.0
Give it to Derrik	I think I know why Donovan picked that 25000 thousandths or something like that	4.0
I think I know why Donovan picked that 25000 thousandths or something like that	Its because the two was before the decimal	4.0
Its because the two was before the decimal	I think thats why it made it look like it was bigger	4.0
Yes and down here I messed up	No worries it should have went 105	3.0

If you dont have that on yours underneath it write it	I have that	1.0
I have that	I do	1.0
Figure out how youre going to add these two together	First you do	0.0
First you do	Actually the big the whole  equal five	3.0
Actually the big the whole  equal five	Are we doing it	0.0
Are we doing it	You dont  but you dont the denominator	3.0
Whats your strategy	because thats why got it wrong because you dont	3.0
because thats why got it wrong because you dont	Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	3.0
Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	So I had fivetenths of it	1.0
What is your strategy	So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	3.0
So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	Not the denominator	1.0
Not the denominator	That s why she got it wrong	1.0
So here if I were to divide this can I put on top of my fraction circle can I put three or fours on top of can I put the thirds on top of the fours	Thats what I did	3.0
Its not going to be equal though	Its not going to be equal so you cant	4.0
Its not going to be equal so you cant	Unless	0.0

Remember theyre the pink ones	Three of 12 would fit	3.0
This 34 is equivalent to 912	Yes	0.0
Yes	You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	4.0
You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	Yes because you did 34 x 3 then that equals 912	4.0
Piper	Four	3.0
Its 112 bigger than two thirds	A little bit	3.0
My denominator is going to be what	Twelve	3.0
So 8  9 is	Seventeen	3.0
From here to here	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	4.0
So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	4.0
You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	Then it would also be a whole because you had to take for 12 and 12 is whole	4.0
What does this line mean Lydia	Is it dividing	3.0
So 12 into 17 if I divide this Im going to end up exactly with what Madelien said 12 goes into 17 how many times	One	3.0
Then I need to subtract 12 from the 17	Five	3.0
Yes I have 1 and 512 is that how much spinach	No	0.0

Team three	So our explanation was I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	4.0
So our explanation was I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	So his answer is wrong	4.0
You have something to add	Yes	0.0
Yes	When he says that the denominator youre not supposed to add or subtract the denominator the reason why is because well its asking Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong	4.0
When he says that the denominator youre not supposed to add or subtract the denominator the reason why is because well its asking Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong	Technically when it says he got the answer 1115 he added 20 and 5 or he subtracted 20 minus 5 which got him 15 and youre not supposed to subtract the denominator	4.0
Do you need your pencil sharpened	Yes	0.0

Hey this group here what did you guys say	We didnt quite have an answer yet were trying to figure it out	0.0
Dont start talking	1540	3.0
1540	Yes	0.0
Hey what about this table	We were	0.0
We were	I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator	4.0
I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator	You only subtract the numerator and we only do that if you have the same denominator	4.0
So kind of the same	Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know	1.0
Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know	I said I know he is wrong because hes  which makes no sense because you have to get the denominator the same at all times	4.0
Is it less than a half	Bigger than a half	3.0
1115 is bigger than a half	So its nowhere near the answer	3.0
I didnt say one thing about my denominators	But definitely wrong too	3.0
I know that this is wrong because of taking this number 1320 subtracting 25 my answer should be close to 0 my answer should be a little bigger than 0	But not as big as a half	3.0
I know you can do the computer	Do you want us to do it on the back	0.0
I want you to do it someplace near number four	back and like four	0.0
The difference would be greater	Ms Carroll  not on the board for number four	0.0
So with the denominator talking about the denominators if I were to give this I would give it a 25 where this would be more of a 35 answer	But technically most answers are correct	0.0
Next Wednesday just because of	Because I already corrected it because	0.0
Okay mixed number Nick do you think you remember what a mixed number is	I think its a number that I forgot	0.0
What do you think Cooper	I think its like an uneven fraction with the denominator  and its like an uneven number with an even number as a denominator and you have to break it down to something that	4.0
What do you mean when you say uneven	Like that thing when you did like last time when we had two even fractions with one and then ten	0.0
Cameron can you add on or clarify or explaining what youre thinking	I think mixed numbers mixed fractions are	0.0
Mixed numbers you were right	Its like one and one half or one and three thirds or something like that	3.0

Yes	Its okay	0.0
Ada tell me what I should have as my decimal	Zero ones and three tenths	3.0

I need a new column dont I	I put one in the tens column two in the ones column eight in the tens column and seven in the hundreds column	4.0
Read that now	12 and 87 hundredths	3.0
Try it again	12 and 87 hundredths	3.0
Caleb what were you doing to help you figure that out	I used I knew that two get the whole numbers two was equal to two of them whole number of the denominator so I added four plus four which was eight	4.0
Tell me more about that	Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them	4.0
Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them	It was one whole which was nine out of the whole	4.0
Tell me a little bit more about that	The denominator was the four thats the whole and since we have two wholes we have to have the wholes add to get Because at the top to have a whole it will need to be four out of four	4.0
How many fourths would that be	Four	3.0
We have eight fourths right now but are we done with all of our fourths	No	0.0

For division	Yes when you divide you make the number smaller	4.0
Yes when you divide you make the number smaller	You move the decimal in front of the number you started with	4.0
What could we respond	I think you got most of it right and I would agree with  My thinking is similar because	1.0
Ive asked Aubrey to come explain come up and show hers and you still have your marker so you can add on to yours while youre here	To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times as the exponent says	4.0
To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times as the exponent says	This occurs the same when you multiply instead of left you shift the decimal to the right	4.0

Can you tell me why you did 33 x 2	I did for hours  the cost per performer	3.0
Okay what did you get when you did 33 x 2	I got 66	3.0
Okay	Then I did 66 x 6 for the numbers of performers	3.0
Okay these are six tap dancers	Then I got 397	3.0
Can you repeat what she	33 x 2 66	4.0
To try and find	33 an hour	3.0
Okay and why did she do that x 2	for two hours	3.0
Then why did she take that and multiply x 6	Because there was	0.0
Lou what do you do with those two numbers	You divide them	3.0
Hunter what are you going to do with them	Im going to look at the other number and try and compare how much more it has	3.0
When you hear how much more what do you think of in your head	I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396	4.0
I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396	Then I look at the six and theres six and then on top there is nine so that means it has more so I break down the six	4.0
Are you adding subtracting multiplying dividing what are you doing	So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number	4.0
So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number	Then thats how much its more	4.0
Are you adding subtracting multiplying or dividing to figure out how much more	Dividing	3.0
Do you guys know how to do threedigit division by threedigit division	No	0.0
What are we going to do Conrad	Youre going to take two of those assignments and then youre going to subtract	4.0
Youre going to take two of those assignments and then youre going to subtract	Then soon when you have the answer then you write that down thats how much more	4.0
When we subtract that what do we end up with Daxton	21600	3.0
So what two groups are we comparing	Tumblers and singing group	3.0
Singers how much do they cost per hour	10800	3.0
16 an hour how long do they perform	Three hours	3.0
How many people are in their group	Four	3.0
Frankie what three numbers do you think were going to multiply together for the singing group	30	3.0
Look at your chart carefully the singing group	16 four	3.0
Whered you get the four	Number of performers	3.0
Then what am I going to multiply that total by	Three	3.0
By three because	Hours of entertainment	3.0
Jasper whats a different way	You could do 4 x 3  12	4.0
You could do 4 x 3  12	Then you multiply 12 x 16	4.0
Is there even another way to do that	Yes	0.0
Lee what would be the third way	You could use 30 x 16 x 4	3.0
Whats an easier number to work with besides 16	20	3.0
What is 20 x 4	80	3.0
Whats 80 times 3	200	3.0
Whats eight times three	24	3.0
Hunter how much do tumblers cost	Tumblers cost 22	3.0
22 an hour times how many hours	Times three	3.0
Then how many people are in their group	Eight	3.0
Whats that	60	3.0
We know our basic factor of six times eight	48	3.0
So whos going to cost more	The tumblers	3.0
Are we subtracting our estimate	No	0.0

How much	528	3.0
How are we going to find the total cost or the total difference how much more it will cost	Subtraction	3.0
What am I going to start with	528	3.0
Im going to do 528 Im going to subtract	192	3.0

Im going to turn my microphone off so that we can hear you not me	Miss  is trying to find you again	0.0
All right Lee	For the burritos I did should I start with my estimates or my	3.0
Lets do the actual number model first and then you could talk us through your estimates and then talk us through how you solved it	I wrote 13 x 3 because of the numbers of packages needed and the cost per item	4.0
Okay so they were 3 per	Yes	0.0
Is this burritos or sandwiches	Burritos	3.0
What else did you do	Then you do x that you do x 8	3.0
Why	Because the numbers of pieces I get is per package	4.0
There are eight burritos in a package okay	Then from my estimate I did 10 x 3 because 10 was the  number	4.0
Okay	That	0.0
That	Lee So I did 10 x 3 is 30	4.0
Lee So I did 10 x 3 is 30	I did that x 8  240	4.0
What did you do next	Then I went to sandwiches	0.0
Then I went to sandwiches	I did 18 x 6 because of the number of packages needed and the cost per item	4.0
Okay so there were 18 sandwiches per package 6 each	I did that x 5	3.0
Because	Because of the items per package	4.0
Oh so we needed 18 packages theyre five sandwiches	Then from my estimate I did I rounded the 18 to 2020 x 6 then x 5	4.0
Then from my estimate I did I rounded the 18 to 2020 x 6 then x 5	x 5  600	4.0

Lillian how was estimate different	I did my estimate of doing 5 x 8	3.0
Where did you get five	I got the five from the three because it was close to five	4.0
Oh so youve rounded your three to be a five since it was a friendlier number	Then I did  x 13 and that equals the number of  Then with the sandwiches I did 5 x 5	4.0
You rounded your six to be a five instead	Yes	0.0
Then did that x 18	Yes	0.0
Did you come up with a very similar number if you add 600 and 240 together	Yes I got 840	3.0
Three estimates	Mine was estimated but I did get the answer with that	3.0
You got something similar	From my own answer I got 852	3.0
Just for your estimate	Oh	0.0
You should get 312 is that correct	Yes	0.0
If we follow the steps that Lee gave us we are going to do 18 x 6 x 5 then push	540	3.0

Gabriel let me go back to my original question sorry why do the strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money	Because it shows	0.0
Liola	I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole	1.0
I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole	They just represent because theyre cents	1.0
You want to add to that please	I agree with Liola but also decimal place its actually the same thing because if you have 7325 in money it practically would be the same just not with a thousand	4.0
Sorry I didnt realize you said Bander sorry	I agree and I would also like to add on because when you write because when you say money you say 781 cents because of the decimal	4.0
Parker	Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	4.0
Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	It depends on what it is  the cents and the whole number would be the dollars	4.0

Does it say that it has to start on these same coordinates in order to be larger	No	0.0
No	It could be on any point	3.0

Why do you say that Brendan	I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	4.0
I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1	4.0
Ravier	They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	4.0
They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25	4.0
What would you like to add to that Kyle	I agree with everybody but I also want to add that you could actuSSy answer that the same because you could make it a mixed number or an improper fraction	4.0
Shout it out	Equal fractions	3.0
Hannah	First I said maybe when youre baking something you could have for example cookies you could have a certain amount of flour maybe a more exact amount maybe you could I dont know convert it to a more precise expression	4.0

Im glad you saw that and we didnt have to correct you	4 times 2 equals 8	4.0
4 times 2 equals 8	600 so I need to multiply 600 plus 80 equals 680	4.0
Jesse	Well Im not in disagreement but	1.0

Joel thank you	Me and David did the same thing just	1.0
Then when I walked by it was like	Can we show what we did	0.0
there you go	So David	0.0
So David	Before Joel corrected me I wrote 240 right here because I thought 30 times 80 was 240 and then Joel told me that I had to add two extra zeros and the I got 2610	4.0
2610 is very different than 500something isnt	Before we did that David	0.0
Before we did that David	When we put the extra zero to 240 he thought it was going be 405  but then he realized that it needed this	4.0
See thats the problem when you dont have your numbers in columns there you go	So we did zero zero zero	3.0
up for me a little bit there you go	426  we got 2610	4.0
