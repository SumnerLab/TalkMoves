So what is it	Yes you just put the	1.0
All right for 1A what do you think the answer is for 1A	This	1.0
How about the answer for 1B	Plus or minus two	4.0
How about 2A	Negative four	4.0
Negative four and 2B	0765	4.0
Yes	Can you show how to solve that one Ms	3.0
Which one am I going to move first the three or the four	Four	4.0
The four and how do I do that	You cubic it	4.0
This is a concept well talk a lot about today	What	1.0
What	You asked me for help	1.0
What does that equal	X	4.0
So the fourth root of this guy you know what that is	2213363839	4.0

Six and two	Three and two	4.0
and what two numbers multiply	Three and two	4.0
Do I have any groups of four	No	1.0
Thats why we do end up with kind of a nasty number but before we go there if I take an even root what do I have to remember	Plus and minus	4.0
Im just finding a spot for you to dump	Thats 110	1.0
Thats 110	I didnt even know you 12 years ago	1.0
I didnt even know you 12 years ago	I was two 12 years ago	1.0

Yes	you	1.0
you	I dont know how to do this	1.0
I dont know how to do this	That first one lets just put X	4.0
That first one lets just put X	I think its  One over negative	2.0
I think its  One over negative	Because Im a girl	1.0
Because Im a girl	One over X	4.0
One over X	Its more than	2.0
Its more than	six and 3X over negative  over 6	4.0
If youre not sure what to do look at this little piece of paper our second toolkit that we started on Thursday last week	Yes I put it on the web page	1.0
Yes I put it on the web page	On the outside	1.0
It is one yes	What happens if you do the negative exponent thing	3.0
What happens if you do the negative exponent thing	You put one	2.0
You put one	It goes into a fraction	1.0
It goes into a fraction	No look at that	2.0
I know this looks	Would you help me because I wasnt here on Tuesday	3.0
Would you help me because I wasnt here on Tuesday	You know what	1.0
You know what	Im very sorry	1.0
Im very sorry	you the answer	1.0
you the answer	One over X the power of  Yes just 1X	4.0
One over X the power of  Yes just 1X	Its just 1X  if you flip it it changes it	2.0
Its just 1X  if you flip it it changes it	Dont know	1.0
Dont know	Whats under that	3.0
Whats under that	Is that a negative sign	4.0
Is that a negative sign	Wow	1.0
Wow	Thats crazy	1.0
Thats crazy	Nobody asked for your opinion	1.0
Nobody asked for your opinion	4 X B to the seventh power	4.0
Great	What about the negative	3.0
What about the negative	You just put it over	4.0
Did you grab one of those from over other there	No	1.0
got it right in front of her	No you should trust me	1.0
No you should trust me	Dude literally look at this thing and then just copy it	1.0
All right	Its right there	1.0
Its right there	No but I have it	1.0
No but I have it	Im an idiot	1.0
Im an idiot	Yes a little bit	1.0
Yes a little bit	You look at the fraction and then	4.0
You look at the fraction and then	Just flip it	2.0
Just flip it	and then you flip it	2.0
and then you flip it	If its negative	4.0
If its negative	So X4 and then you just put 1X	4.0
So X4 and then you just put 1X	Im not sure if thats right its	2.0
Yes theres really not too much  but get the	Next	1.0
Next	How are you doing there	1.0
How are you doing there	Is it just A B	4.0
Is it just A B	Is it just the same thing as times one	4.0
Is it just the same thing as times one	Or six  one	4.0
Or six  one	Four	4.0
Four	No thats different	2.0
No thats different	Yes I think its  Thats just Y2	4.0
Yes I think its  Thats just Y2	Where did you put number three though	3.0
Where did you put number three though	Thats just	1.0
Thats just	Oh my gosh	1.0
Oh my gosh	Is that to the power of one	4.0
Is that to the power of one	Yes	1.0
If youre person number one in your team so like Sara and Eli and Decia survey your other team members and see is there any questions that they have on these six problems	Are there any questions you have for me	1.0
Are there any questions you have for me	Yes	1.0
Yes	You just flip it	4.0
You just flip it	Its just B74	4.0
Its just B74	Yes but this was	2.0
Did you get your question and answer	Oh shit	1.0
Oh shit	Where does it say that	3.0
Where does it say that	All of the answers	1.0
All of the answers	Yes	1.0
Yes	You can flip it and then you multiply the four down	4.0
You can flip it and then you multiply the four down	Whats number two	3.0
Whats number two	Dude	1.0
Dude	Number two	1.0
Number two	3X  This is not what we have	2.0
3X  This is not what we have	I dont know how she gets these at all	2.0
I dont know how she gets these at all	I got	1.0
I got	36	4.0
Chase	I have a question on two and three	3.0
I have a question on two and three	I have  two and three	1.0
I have  two and three	Whyd she say my name	1.0
All right so if you look	Lets pretend that you just asked for two and three	1.0
Lets pretend that you just asked for two and three	What	1.0
What is the 6 on	The X	4.0
Just the X	Oh my God were stupid	1.0
So once I flipped it I can change it from a negative six to a positive six and Im done	I dont understand	3.0
I dont understand	The problem is that every single one is a different formula which makes it really hard	4.0
Put it up there and make it positive	negative	4.0
and its over one so I dont need that one so I got that	Then you just change it to	4.0
Then you just change it to	Memorize that real quick	1.0
Memorize that real quick	Good luck Nathan	1.0
Any questions from your group	No	1.0
No	No	2.0
All right	We are the smart team	1.0
Questions with your group	They just couldnt see it that well	1.0
Eli any questions	No it was the same thing  answered	1.0
The idea here this is written in what kind of form	Rational unrational	4.0
We have an	Exponent exponential	4.0
If we switch it to a radical form what would I call it	Rational form	4.0
What would I put here	Three	4.0
Three	Three	2.0
Whats the vocabulary	Cubic	4.0
Cubic	Cubic	2.0
Yes it is a cubic but Im looking for generically	Cubed	4.0
what do we call the number right there	Index	4.0
All right what do we call this symbol	The radical	4.0
What do we call the number eight inside	Number eight	4.0
Where did our one go	Its the exponent on the outside	4.0
All right so can I rewrite eight as something to the power of three	No	1.0
No	Wait	1.0
Wait	Yes	4.0
Because is 9 X 9 X 9 27	No	1.0
How do you solve this problem	This may have been one of the ones I	1.0
This may have been one of the ones I	You subtract 40 from both sides and you get X  15	4.0
You subtract 40 from both sides and you get X  15	Thats five	2.0
Thats five	No three	4.0
No three	Its 247	4.0

Thats so mean John	That was like	1.0
That was like	Alvin is a whole lot further along	1.0
How did that happen	Because I have stuck on this one	1.0
Because I have stuck on this one	She just	1.0
If I ignore the  and I just look at that how could I rewrite that	Thats not very helpful	1.0
Thats not very helpful	No	1.0
Basically going from exponent idea to	If this is equal this would that mean that this is equal to this square root of  36 would be six	5.0
If this is equal this would that mean that this is equal to this square root of  36 would be six	Sure okay so you do three in the denominator	5.0
Sure okay so you do three in the denominator	Because if you try to square square root  its too hard	4.0
What if I have squared x squared to the third what does that mean to you	I mean do you have any better ideas	2.0
I mean do you have any better ideas	No	1.0
No not  because I dont have a fraction  to the what power	15	4.0
Right what did I do	Whats the cubic root of  25 is five	4.0
Now I have  two thirds and then it leads to theWhat happened then I do four	27 x 5 is  the fourth power	4.0
Whats my final answer	No	1.0
Two	Three	4.0
Three	that just  six	2.0
that just  six	Yes its three	2.0
Yes its three	No thats	2.0
No thats	Okay for this one would you do the 98 divided by two	4.0
You know we had a couple of different	We do 98 divided by 30 and then you find	4.0
We do 98 divided by 30 and then you find	I dont know where	1.0
What do you think are some options	That ones hard	1.0
That ones hard	Its just the same thing isnt it	4.0
Its just the same thing isnt it	No but the number is like 000	2.0
No but the number is like 000	Wow okay	1.0
Wow okay	Isnt that hard	1.0
Isnt that hard	Maybe you find	1.0
Maybe you find	It may be 1024	4.0
Alright	Could you do the square of four times the square of three because you also square the whole	5.0
You want to make sure you know how you get those answers how do you get those answers	Four to the fifth power is 64	4.0
Four to the fifth power is 64	No its not	2.0
No its not	One over the 10th power is 4	4.0

Draw the person in the hand	I got an idea I dont know	1.0
Does 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 equals 236	Yes	1.0
What do you need to know how to do	I dont even know whats the	1.0
This	Oh	1.0
Oh	How would you find  would find the cube	3.0
Probably going to put it in your calculator to find out what it is	You can use calculators on the quiz	1.0
Anybody in here got questions	Walk up there if you need	1.0

One thirteen	Fifteen	1.0
So Im rationalizing	Number five	4.0
Number five	Im going to just go  10x	4.0
Ms SaundersThe area of it would be	You have that extra practice test	1.0
You have that extra practice test	Yes	1.0
Did you check your answers yet	Yes	1.0
Youve got to look at four to get so youll do	Can I do it	1.0
Itll be on my desk then	Okay thank you	1.0
Guys weve got the level four for you to do	Area	4.0
Area	Perimeter	2.0
Perimeter	Perimeter	2.0
Perimeter	Yes you want to do that	2.0
Yes you want to do that	Yes I just didnt distribute the four	2.0
Yes I just didnt distribute the four	I just got 40x	4.0
We need to get you to level four	You could do that too but you still get 40x	4.0
You could do that too but you still get 40x	Yes but then wouldnt you have to multiply that to the 14 power	4.0
Did you finish the extra practice	I thought we only had Just kidding were not done at 215	1.0
Does everybody have a whiteboard a marker and a way to erase	Yes	1.0
Go	Fortyone and eight tens	4.0
Talk us through it	I started with forty and then I added a one and then I added eight tens	5.0
Go	Fifty and thirteen hundreds	4.0
Jayden would you keep yours up high and share your thinking	I started with fifty added fifty and since theres of inserting nothing in the ones I dont have to do anything there	5.0
I started with fifty added fifty and since theres of inserting nothing in the ones I dont have to do anything there	Then for tens I put a decimal point and one and then for hundreds I did a decimal point a zero and a three	5.0
Who also I need to give three claps to Ross	Yes	1.0
Go	Zero and seventy one hundreds	4.0
Go ahead and tell us your thinking	I did seven	1.0
How would you say this seven	Seven tens plus one hundreds	4.0
Go	Yeehaw	1.0
Go	Nine hundred six and forty five thousands	4.0
Oh	Yes the end	1.0
Emily do you want to call in someone to help you	Brendan	1.0
Brendan	My thinking is different by this something that you accidentally said four tens when it was four hundreds	2.0
That makes sense hun	Yes	1.0
Go	I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication on fractions by whole numbers	4.0
Youre going to partner up with someone sitting close to you do you have perfect partners Miss Kay	Yes	1.0
You two	Yes but they all have different denominators	4.0
Go	Theyre the same thing	4.0
Theyre the same thing	The numerator is always one such as the denominator	4.0
The numerator is always one such as the denominator	We both agree already but yours sounds better	2.0
We both agree already but yours sounds better	You have a longer definition	2.0
You have a longer definition	Its a fraction model where the numerator is the same and then denominator is different	4.0
Its a fraction model where the numerator is the same and then denominator is different	The numerator is the same of a one fraction the denominator is different	4.0
The numerator is the same of a one fraction the denominator is different	Because the numerator is always one does that mean none of these fractions could ever be equivalent	3.0
The denominator is the	Is the number of	4.0
Samples	Yes	1.0
Tell me more about the	The whole fraction	4.0
The number of	The number	1.0
Of pieces in the whole	Yes	1.0
Mia may I have you come up and stand up front and share is it okay if I have you we put your bottom definition up	A unit fraction is one for the numerator and the denominator is the number that shows how many pieces are in a whole	4.0
A unit fraction is one for the numerator and the denominator is the number that shows how many pieces are in a whole	Basically in a unit fraction the numerator should be a one and the denominator is going to be the amount of pieces drawn or shown in the denominator	4.0
Its okay but I just want to make it clear to our class that a unit fraction always has one as the what	Numerator	4.0
And whats the denominator in the unit fraction	Any number	4.0
But it shows the	Pieces that are in the whole	4.0
Say the unit fraction	One fifteenth	4.0
The unit fraction is always when we have a one as the numerator and the denominator is the number of pieces correct	Yes	1.0
Go	One fifth	4.0
What is it asking	Basically 15 divided by five	4.0
Im going have you turn around and face your classmates and then I want classmates to remember when someones speaking what should we do doing	Listening	1.0
Go	The fraction  asking what is one fifth of 15	4.0
What is that asking us to do	Asking us to figure out what is one fifth of 15 and what number it is	4.0
Would you call you on someone else please to continue our conversation	Sofia	1.0
Sofia	Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	4.0
Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	I might  more except that I think that it may be how much of a fifth would go into 15	2.0
How would you prove this is right	and five times three equals 15	5.0
Tell me more about this	I drew this because of one fifth and I did  and then Im going to shade it and then Im just going to	4.0
Jayden would you start as our first teacher to share how did you think about what is one fifth of 15	First I drew  which is 15	5.0
First I drew  which is 15	Each row here is one fifth  is also three and the whole represents 15	5.0
Jayden call on someone	You have something Brendan	1.0
You have something Brendan	He explained it very well	2.0
Was your thinking similar	It was my thinking was similar	2.0
It was my thinking was similar	Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	2.0
Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	5.0
I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	So that will be 15 fifths	5.0
So that will be 15 fifths	Then if you break that into a mixed number it will just be three wholes	5.0
Hey Ryan tell us about your thinking	So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths	5.0
Why	I did that because you said one fifth of 15	5.0
I did that because you said one fifth of 15	So I made this	5.0
So I made this	Then I knew five times three equal 15	5.0
Then I knew five times three equal 15	So I did three on each my fifths	5.0
When you said you did you wrote three on each fifth because	Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	5.0
Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	So I wrote threes to represent my answer	5.0
Call on someone	Because he knew that three times five is 15	2.0
Everybody say thank you Ryan	Thank you Ryan	1.0
So fifth graders I want you to be thinking about look at how there were several different ways to solve one fifth of 15	There was five one fifth and  five times three equals 15	5.0
No what do you think about how Avery solved Elijah	She put three into fives	2.0
The connection to multiplication is	Five times three equals 15	5.0
Everybody say were proud of you Avery	Were proud of you Avery	1.0
I forgot who else I called	Liam	1.0
I said its right but how did you get it	Five times three equals 15 and automatically that one fifth of 15 is three	5.0
So knowing the connection between multiplication what would you say the connection is between multiplication and unit fraction of problems	So lets say like this part is	1.0
You can use that green marker you can use any expo marker	So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	5.0
So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	Then so this  you divide up here	5.0
Then so this  you divide up here	You have to know what the easy problems are first	1.0
You have to know what the easy problems are first	If you cant think of something easy then you can go to something	1.0
Say congratulations Liam first	Congratulations Liam	1.0
If we know that one talk with me ready I want to hear all of your voices	One fifth of 15 is three	5.0
Perhaps three fifths of 15  on your whiteboards go	I cant hear you	1.0
Caleb can you tell us your thinking first	My thinking was lets I had  and I wanted 25 of it and then I would get six apples	5.0
How did you get six	I got six because	1.0
One group 15 of 15 equals	Three	4.0
The second group of dots gets us what	Six	4.0
Six	Six	2.0
What class	Three	4.0
Three	Three	2.0
What is 25 of 15	Six	4.0
My friends tell Caleb Awesome job	Awesome job Caleb	1.0
Now Caleb showed us 25 and 35 and now we have 45	first question we get was  the original answer was 3 x 4 because all were doing was find 45 of 15 and I got	4.0
Yes	I agree	2.0
Whole class what is it	Fifteen	4.0

I know that one	Whos the agent now	1.0
Whos the agent now	Im just going to write seven	1.0
Im just going to write seven	I dont know	1.0
I dont know	Plus 12  2 is 24	5.0
Youre going to have to first figure out what is 13	Yes	1.0
What is 13 of 24	Eight	4.0
Eight	Yes	1.0
So 23 of 24 is	Number two is really hard	1.0
Now youre to figure out whats 13 of	Number two is really hard	1.0
Number two is really hard	What do you want	1.0
What do you want	Nothing	1.0
Brendan will you share with us your thinking here on number three	On number three	1.0
How did you start	I started with looking at the first two which showed kind of Actually I first looked at what the rule was	4.0
The rule is 23 thats not a unit fraction so what was your step	My step first was to find the unit fraction of each of the numbers and then multiply that by two	5.0
So whats onethird of nine Brendan	Three	4.0
One third of nine is three and then we multiply	By two	4.0
by two and get	Six	4.0
Six	Six	2.0
So how did that help you here on the 12	I did and then you put the same thing find out 13 of 12 is 4 so then 4  2 is 8	5.0
Yes my dear	On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	4.0
On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	No	1.0
No	Oh yes 3 2 is 6 so then I would have to do 2  2 and I know thats 4	5.0
So my friends if you have finished numbers three and four please move on to five and six but Miss Kay and I are coming around to check number four	Im done	1.0
Then you may move on to five and six	That would be seven and six	1.0
That would be seven and six	Four times six	4.0
Four times six	Yes	1.0
Yes	Four times	4.0
So the first thing did you figure out what those are	Those are	1.0
Those are	No	1.0
You dont remember	Because if I did it and youre looking over here its never	1.0
and you got	24	4.0
Hmm	Is it wrong too	1.0
Im asking you to share your thoughts	I got seven and I just multiplied it by three	4.0
How did you 15 right here	Because originally four times five is 20 multiplying five times  all that	5.0
Were you able to finish  here	Not quite yet	1.0
Oh I love how you started 14 of eight	Its like youre getting that	1.0

Hank	I was finding 15 of 12	4.0
And then why did you multiply it times two	I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12	5.0
I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12	I did find the numerator which was two	5.0
Ryland	You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	5.0
You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	5.0
If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	Youre only finding 25 of 12	5.0
Im going to show you this	Yes	1.0
too	I think  time	1.0
I think  time	What I did was I drew the two rules because I drew one plus one equals two	5.0
What I did was I drew the two rules because I drew one plus one equals two	Then I drew two halves because  a half plus a half that will be  two	5.0
Then I drew two halves because  a half plus a half that will be  two	12 plus 12 will equal three	5.0
Okay talk to us about your thinking	My thinking was theres  and then since theres 24 going into each  I put a one and two and then since you  theres only one more	5.0
My thinking was theres  and then since theres 24 going into each  I put a one and two and then since you  theres only one more	You have the  equal share	5.0
You have the  equal share	I split it into half and I gave one and two	5.0
I split it into half and I gave one and two	Each half gets one	5.0
I see your answer there	Eighths are equivalent to fours you can make	4.0
No	Fourths are equivalent to eighth	4.0
How many eighths are equivalent to 14	Two	4.0
How can you prove that	Its because	1.0
Explain your thinking	I drew eights and this are equal to four	4.0
Do you agree	Yes	2.0
Nicely done	Since  12 and 34	4.0
We	Since we were trying to get 12 of 34 we knew that 12 of 34 wasnt youre going to do 12 of 34 because theres not enough	5.0
Since we were trying to get 12 of 34 we knew that 12 of 34 wasnt youre going to do 12 of 34 because theres not enough	34 thats just three  If you do just three you cant split three into 12 and you cant say 1 and 12 of the first fraction where we said 12 of three because were doing a fraction not a whole number	5.0
34 thats just three  If you do just three you cant split three into 12 and you cant say 1 and 12 of the first fraction where we said 12 of three because were doing a fraction not a whole number	We got eights and we knew that 28 is equivalent to 14	5.0
We got eights and we knew that 28 is equivalent to 14	We dont need  We knew that 28 is equivalent to 14 and Since 28 is equivalent to 14 we said Since theres 34 we said theyre 68	5.0
We dont need  We knew that 28 is equivalent to 14 and Since 28 is equivalent to 14 we said Since theres 34 we said theyre 68	You could split six into half into a half and half of six is three	5.0
You could split six into half into a half and half of six is three	We said the answer is 38 because half of six is three and if we do 68 its dividable by 12 because	5.0
Maybe show us that show us that we will not	You could do	1.0
There you go	This is one person this is the other person	5.0
This is one person this is the other person	They each get 14	5.0
They each get 14	Theres 14 remaining so you split 14 into 12 and you give each person 18	5.0
Put your eighths on there	Yes	1.0
to show that	Since there is 14 remaining and theres two people you can put 28 over the fourth	5.0
Since there is 14 remaining and theres two people you can put 28 over the fourth	Then you can give each person 18 then it would be 14 it would be 38 because 28 is equivalent to 14 like weve said	5.0
Then you can give each person 18 then it would be 14 it would be 38 because 28 is equivalent to 14 like weve said	It pretty much gives you them a 38 if you give him 18	5.0

Must have been a small  right	Juliets hungry	1.0
Oaklee	Sorry can you repeat the question	1.0
What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell	23 of 12 is 46	4.0
Look at your paperfolding model	26	4.0
Does your model not show that	It does	4.0
Is that not what yours shows	Yes that what mine shows	4.0
How can you tell that its 26	I can tell its 26 because I shaded the opposite way of my other color on two of the and  because were doing six	5.0
I can tell its 26 because I shaded the opposite way of my other color on two of the and  because were doing six	Theres six squares that we folded  and we shaded	5.0
Theres six squares that we folded  and we shaded	Miss	1.0
Yes sir	May I speak to you for a minute	1.0
Yes sir	Thank you	1.0
Go for it	Okay	1.0
Okay	We coloredin lines we did lines the opposite way on two of the boxes	5.0
We coloredin lines we did lines the opposite way on two of the boxes	That would be 26 because theres six squares in all	5.0
That would be 26 because theres six squares in all	It would be 26	5.0
Should you keep these examples	Yes	1.0
Lets just renew our learning intention like we did together please	Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with some unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	1.0

Are SS fractions that we add and subtract going to have the same common denominators	No	1.0
We just now SS said not SS fractions that were adding and subtracting have the same denominators so why do you have to find a common denominator	So it is easier to just subtract them	5.0
Why do you not necessarily totSSy agree with that Hunter	I lost it	1.0
What	I lost my answer	1.0
SS right Marcus is going to explain the relMaureennce of this to us	We said that my team thinks that it be easier to add and subtract it when you have a common denominator with it	4.0
Hunter is it just easier or do you have to have a common denominator	Me and Clyde said its sort of a little bit of both	4.0
Me and Clyde said its sort of a little bit of both	Its a little bit because you have to have a common denominator	4.0
Common read it with me	Finding fractions that are the same	1.0
I said think about when we say we have something in common like Nikeel and I were talking this morning about our pets and what was going on with your dog	He was sleeping on me and I had to get up and it was super hard	1.0
Hes as big as you are practicSSy right	Yes	1.0
It was more a mental guilt for me but did we have that in common that our pets wanted to sleep with us	Yes	1.0
Do we have to have that in common	No	1.0
Some of you are going This doesnt relate to me at SS but for fractions we keep saying they have to have this common denominator that means that denominator has to be	Equal	4.0
Equal	Equal	2.0
I like the way you keep going to equal or another word would that will be	Same	4.0
Same	Equivalent	2.0
Lets read what it says about unlike ready go	For fractions to be unlike they have to have different numbers in the denominator	1.0
Royce	They have different denominators and if you look on the picture theyre different size box for onesixth and onetwelfth	5.0
Lets read this	I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	1.0
River can you explain to us how you got zero	I got zero because I know onefourth is equivalent to threetwelfths and it would equal zero anyway because onefourth is smSS and threetwelfths is also smSS so if you round its going to be anywhere close to zero	5.0
Cooper	What me and Nikeel said we said that onefourth is between zero and onehalf then if youre subtracting threetwelfths from that onefourth its going to be closer to zero because youre already in the half and if youre subtracting its going to be closer to zero	5.0
Again you are going to talk with your face partner gain and partner A starts to explain their thinking	Onehalf minus anything would be closer to one	4.0
Cooper B can you explain your thinking please	I said a one whole because if you do onethird to onehalf its only a way because of a little bit smSS	5.0
I said a one whole because if you do onethird to onehalf its only a way because of a little bit smSS	I took only a little bit more than one whole and since its over one whole	5.0
Cooper do you want to approach	Yes	1.0
Can you explain your picture or your model to your face partner and Ive lost count I think its partner	B	1.0
Lets have Cooper explain his thinking using the model youve drawn on the board	Yes	1.0
Lets give him a round of applause	I said one because if you take one third and put it on a half its not the same size there is still a little bit more leftover but there is one sixth left over and thats more than a whole	5.0
I said one because if you take one third and put it on a half its not the same size there is still a little bit more leftover but there is one sixth left over and thats more than a whole	There is nothing above a whole	5.0
There is nothing above a whole	There is not another benchmark upon the whole so I said one	5.0

How like the skill of knowing that my answer is closer to zero number one help me with this	Are we supposed to find equivalent fractions	4.0
Charlie	Me and Paulina said its kind of like an estimate so like when youre solving and you find an equivalent fraction when you find your actual answer and you can use it to check your work and its kinda realistic	4.0
How was your answer different than what you just heard Charlie say	Its because she said it was an estimate and youre supposed to do the estimate and then find the answer and check your work but I said just to find equivalent fractions and to solve equations	2.0

Sheila tell everybody what you figured out	BasicSSy what youre doing is youre doing 2x24 and then 3x26t	4.0
What were you doing there Sheila	What I was doing is basicSSy youre multiplying it by two	4.0
Youre multiplying the numerator	And the denominator by two	4.0
What do we know the rule is when you multiply a number by one	Same thing	4.0
Are you changing that number	No	1.0
Popcorn it out whats one way you can prove it	Divide	4.0
What do you mean by that	You could see if that number Well maybe multiply that number that fraction you originSSy had to see if it got one of those fractions	4.0

We have four sixths and two thirds	If youre ever needing to add them you can see youre trying to add them	5.0
If youre ever needing to add them you can see youre trying to add them	You can see that it takes two sixths to make one third	5.0
You can see that it takes two sixths to make one third	To get to this you would multiply a third like with the same thing on the top and the bottom by two and that would be You can see that they are equal because you have twothirds equals to four sixths because it takes four sixths to get two thirds	5.0
Can you prove another there for us	Yes	1.0
Should we be building right now	No	1.0
No	equals to three because if you multiply if you do onefourth times two you get two eighths and if its two divided by two eighths If you switch two eighths with a half you get one fourth	5.0
Im confused	One fourth multiplied by two is two eighths	5.0
Do you want to go work on this and come back	Yes	1.0
I was just reminding you when youre multiplying whats our old saying	Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	4.0
Wherever youre at	Stay there	1.0
See this subtraction symbol in the final answer	Yes	1.0

Because you cant automaticSSy say Well one half plus one half is one	You have to use multiple strategies and to check your work and find common denominators	5.0
Elijah	Its difficult because theyre not the same denominator and you wont know	5.0
Its difficult because theyre not the same denominator and you wont know	If its three sixths plus onefourth or onefourth minus three sixths or something like that its difficult because you have to figure out a common denominator for it	5.0
If its three sixths plus onefourth or onefourth minus three sixths or something like that its difficult because you have to figure out a common denominator for it	Theyre not equivalent at first	5.0
Theyre not equivalent at first	Denominators are different so its harder because theyre bigger fractions and theres smSSer fractions of each other	5.0
Denominators are different so its harder because theyre bigger fractions and theres smSSer fractions of each other	Its a less efficient way with different denominators as well because you have to get fraction circles and actuSSy work a long time to actuSSy be able to figure out the right answer	5.0

Hello	Now that were alone	1.0
Now that were alone	first	1.0
first	Yes Ive never got to factor it at all	4.0
Yes Ive never got to factor it at all	Yes just factor it out first	2.0
Yes just factor it out first	Yes	2.0
Yes	Factor	4.0
Factor	Im not doing	1.0
Im not doing	Not me	1.0
Not me	It was like two oclock and I was	1.0
It was like two oclock and I was	Right now its  lets see what  So I went back  and I started relistening to Living Tombstone	1.0

DOKI DOKI	That sounds super sketchy	1.0
That sounds super sketchy	Did you get 7075	2.0
Did you get 7075	Yes	1.0
Yes	the Y	4.0
the Y	the Y	2.0
Start	Maybe Im wrong	1.0
Maybe Im wrong	No I did	1.0
No I did	I mightve done	1.0
I mightve done	All right so 15	4.0
All right so 15	We have 3 and 15 right	4.0
We have 3 and 15 right	Yes	2.0
Yes	Shoot	1.0
Shoot	Why am I wrong	3.0
Why am I wrong	So its 15  fraction	4.0
So its 15  fraction	So 2 52 you get 2254 I get	5.0
Ladies and gentlemen eyes of upfront please	talking to	1.0
talking to	I dont like this class	1.0
Hopefully its limited and we get to go at 224 right	Yes	1.0
What form is this in	Standard	4.0
Standard	Standard	2.0
When we factor the standard form equation what do we call that form	Standard form	4.0
No this is standard so when we factor it I used to call it factor form but the big idea has a different name for it	Standard	4.0
Youre getting the right idea Chloe	Standard	4.0
Standard	Yes youve got it	2.0
Yes youve got it	Right	1.0
Hold on	is so quiet	1.0
Whats the thing that factor form tells us	The intercepts	4.0
The intercepts	That it intercepts	2.0
X intercepts so we want to call it	Intercept form	4.0
When you feel confident about those two then move on to problem number one two three and four	I havent factored	1.0
I havent factored	Completing this	1.0
Thats the only thing	that would take longer to do	4.0
Well well compromise	and then you have X  5	4.0
Do one we really need	Okay	1.0
Okay	Look at this one	1.0
This is five and six	multiplies to this as this	4.0
multiplies to this as this	The hell	1.0
The hell	Like the quadratic formula	4.0
Like the quadratic formula	No	2.0
No	No	2.0
No	We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus	5.0
We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus	Weve got the negative  but this is a positive	5.0
Weve got the negative  but this is a positive	So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five	5.0
So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five	So I did positive two and negative five and then	5.0
So I did positive two and negative five and then	Does that make sense	1.0
Does that make sense	Yes	1.0
Thats	I have a negative	4.0
If I know X how do I find Y	Point it towards the X	4.0
I plug that in the equation	Got it	1.0
Okay	Im starting to figure out how you like get it	1.0
Im starting to figure out how you like get it	Wheres the X times that and then you square it on the outside	4.0
Wheres the X times that and then you square it on the outside	Thats what Im talking about	1.0
Thats what Im talking about	Yes we can find them	4.0
Yes we can find them	Ill tell you if I  or you can just plug it off	2.0
Ill tell you if I  or you can just plug it off	just going to point it in there	4.0
Well the good news is you dont have to	No I need to	1.0
No I need to	Were staying  math today	1.0
So this is more the kind of strategy for this one	Negative one over 12	4.0
Let me figure out a couple of sample problems and Ill put them up	So 15 is the X value	4.0
So 15 is the X value	Thats where	1.0
Thats where	So we plug that in  negative B	4.0
So we plug that in  negative B	Oh you have to plug in 22 five times	2.0
Oh you have to plug in 22 five times	225 plus or minus  negative 145	4.0
225 plus or minus  negative 145	Thats negative	2.0
Thats negative	No thats 235	2.0
No thats 235	Its going to be 1225 negative 1225	4.0
Its going to be 1225 negative 1225	Yes	2.0
Yes	Write that there and then we dont have to	4.0
Write that there and then we dont have to	Since that is 15 away from here	4.0
Since that is 15 away from here	We did it	1.0
We did it	For sure	1.0
For sure	I hit the car button but nothing happened	4.0
I hit the car button but nothing happened	Well the Y intercept is	2.0
Well the Y intercept is	Nothing happened	2.0
Nothing happened	So negative 1225	2.0
So negative 1225	Yes	2.0
Yes	We did it	1.0
We did it	We did	1.0
We did	How are you supposed to do that	3.0
How are you supposed to do that	Next one	1.0
Thats what I was hoping to do	Now were going to do the	1.0
but I could check just to see if its	Yes negative two and five are there	5.0
Yes negative two and five are there	And then that would be negative	5.0
And then that would be negative	No itd be 124	2.0
No itd be 124	Yes but then you square it then itd be positive	2.0
Yes but then you square it then itd be positive	So you get 025 or 14	4.0
So you get 025 or 14	We keep it in fraction	4.0
Ladies and gentlemen we get to stay together until three	Oh no	1.0
Oh no	Im supposed to know	1.0
Because	Can we just like  homework	1.0
Well heres my plan	Do we have time to work	1.0
Is that okay	Can I	1.0
Can I	Anyone	1.0
Well I definitely want to go over this you may want to take notes with this	No way	1.0
So again Im in standard form	I want Taco Bell	1.0
My Avalue is one whats my B value	Three	4.0
Three	Three	2.0
Ten is called a	Yintercept	4.0
What Im hoping is somewhere in your memory is this phrase factors of C What is C in this case	Ten	4.0
What are the factors of 10	One	4.0
One	Ten	2.0
Were being systematic	One two	4.0
Its one and	Five	4.0
Or two and	Five	4.0
Five	Five	2.0
Or three	No	1.0
Or four		4.0
Or five	Two	4.0
Whats different about that set	There has to be a multiple	4.0
My second set of factors of C	It has that	1.0
So my Bvalue is	Three	4.0
Three	Three	2.0
Three does one of those combination add to three	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	2.0
Which one	Five	4.0
Five	Maybe five and two	2.0
Maybe five and two	Two and	4.0
Two and	Five and negative two	2.0
Five and negative two	Five and negative two	2.0
Do I have any factors of C that add up to B	No	1.0
No	No	2.0
What does that mean I have to use	Quadratic formula	4.0
Does one of those add up to three	Negative two and five	4.0
Whats always true about Xintercepts my two ordered pairs whats always true about an Xintercept	The Y is zero	4.0
So this has to be zero here and Im multiplying two things together and my answer is zero what does one of them have to be	Zero	4.0
Zero	Zero	2.0
Right	Yes	1.0
How do I find the line of symmetry	You add those two together	4.0
Y is going to be negative 15 minus two negative 15 plus five	negative 10 you add that to one	4.0
Negative three halves oh this would be	I cant because that doesnt make any sense	1.0
I cant because that doesnt make any sense	Its negative its not negative B	4.0
Its negative its not negative B	Yes but the whole fraction is	2.0
Yes but the whole fraction is	If its negative	4.0
All right just finish that work for tomorrow	That was like epic though	1.0
That was like epic though	I was going to	1.0

23 and 0412	What were you saying again	1.0
Its in the tenths place and theres two tenths so thats what	10 20	4.0
Class lets try that again	10 20	4.0
Whats the value of the three now	Three	4.0
Say it if you know	Three	4.0
What place is this four in	Tenths	4.0
What place is the one in	Hundredths	4.0
What place value does the two have	Thousandths	4.0

How am I going to know when youre done	We stand up	2.0
Why do you have number four	I think its one or the other so there are is it three six	4.0
I think its one or the other so there are is it three six	Itd be two negative one would be negative if you stick the same thing its going to be one and four	2.0
Itd be two negative one would be negative if you stick the same thing its going to be one and four	We need to stand up	1.0
We need to stand up	We do	1.0
We do	Were going to pay attention	1.0
Is there anything we need to talk about as a class	No	1.0
Any questions	No we dont have any questions	1.0
Brad	Were good	1.0
All right anybody else have questions	I need help with	3.0
Well take	I forgot how to do that but theres	1.0
This part right here	Yes	1.0
If its a linear equation do the ends of a line go in opposite directions or the same direction	Opposite	4.0
If its to the first degree so x to the first is a linear were doing this if its quadratic were doing this if its cubic if its quartic and it just keeps going like that right	Yes	1.0
Three	Yes	1.0
Whats the degree of that one	It is three	4.0
Is that an odd or even number	Its odd	4.0
Is it going in the same or different directions	It is going in different	4.0
How do I know whether its going like that or like that	If its positive or negative	4.0
In this case this one is	It is positive	4.0
Is it doing this or this	Its going like that	4.0
Okay so if its going like that how many different directions do the cubic go	Is it three	4.0
If I draw my curve how many directions do the cubic go	Two	4.0
Two	Four	2.0
Four	Three	2.0
Three	Four	2.0
Four	Three	2.0
Now were ready to answer the question	Yes	1.0
As x goes to negative infinity so lets just say thats my xaxis so x is going in that direction where are my ys going	Id like to believe down negative	4.0
In this case as the xs get bigger and are going towards infinity my ys are going to positive infinity	Why	3.0
Thats for this particular one	Okay	1.0
All right so what youre thinking of right here is as x basically goes far left y is going down	So whats the answer	3.0
As x is moving towards negative infinity y is going to	Negative	4.0
If I go all the way over here as x is getting really positive what are my Y values doing	Theyre going to positive	4.0
Do you have a question	No	1.0
Go John	Go John	1.0
I dont know	If f is a polynomial  and then n be  number such that	1.0
f of a	Hes stupid	1.0
Hes stupid	Im	1.0
All right Layla help him out	f0 and f0 then  a tleast one real zero between the digits	1.0
For example if f if this y value is greater than zero then y has to be	Positive	4.0
Melinda could you read number one	On the graph every point  because the outcomes are most n minus one for any	1.0
Whats the degree in this	Three	4.0
If n is three 31	Two	4.0
Two	Two points	2.0
Two points	Two	2.0
Faith could you read number two please	If a polynomial approaching  n distance through zero  is graphed as exactly n minus one turning points	1.0
A zero they use that term a lot but it just simply means an	xintercept	4.0
If I have three xintercepts 31 is	Two	4.0
What would the degree of this likely be	Four	4.0
41 is	Three	4.0
41	Three	4.0
It has exactly	Six	4.0
51	Four	4.0
Thats one clever assignment	15 questions	1.0
Now if I do a negative times a negative times a negative I end up with a	Negative	4.0
If I multiply a negative times itself four times what do I end up with	Positive	4.0
That ones two times so how does that compare with what I started with here	Its the exact same	4.0
Its the exact same thing	Yes	1.0
Questions right now on that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah Bens here	So I dont have to  to do it with negative or positive	4.0

Youre not helping	Okay	1.0
Okay	248thousandths	4.0
Which ones bigger	248thousandths	4.0
248thousandths	248thousandths	2.0
248thousandths	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Zero and 34hundredths	How do you say it again	3.0
248thousandths	248thousandths	4.0
248thousandths	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Zero and 34hundredths	Zero and 34thousandths	2.0
Zero and 34thousandths	He said it	2.0
He said it	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Zero and 34hundredths	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Zero and 34hundredths	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Zero and 34hundredths	Does he know zero and 34 hundredths	1.0
Does he know zero and 34 hundredths	Zero and 34hundredths	2.0
Great so we had a mixed response	After Catherine said it then some kid started the same	2.0
After Catherine said it then some kid started the same	Yes	2.0
Well Daniella said it first	Remember when in the video it said that you can use	1.0
Remember when in the video it said that you can use	If there arent enough numbers since 034 thousandths I mean hundredths you can add a zero and it would be thousands and so 340 is definitely bigger than 248 so thats logic	5.0
If there arent enough numbers since 034 thousandths I mean hundredths you can add a zero and it would be thousands and so 340 is definitely bigger than 248 so thats logic	You can see because in the first number theyre bringing the two	2.0
You can see because in the first number theyre bringing the two	Yes	2.0
He wants to say something	We almost forgot about that	1.0
Lets listen to Derrik	Also in the video it said You would always go for the first number and whichever is bigger you would just ignore the numbers behind it	4.0
Also in the video it said You would always go for the first number and whichever is bigger you would just ignore the numbers behind it	You would just ignore them	4.0
You would just ignore them	The three is bigger than the two so to the three is obviously the one that wins	5.0
The three is bigger than the two so to the three is obviously the one that wins	Im going to change my answer	4.0
After hearing their responses	Yes	1.0
All right so what are you changing it to	I am changing my answer to 34hundredths because like Derrik said in the video you should go for whichever is bigger on the left side basically	5.0
I am changing my answer to 34hundredths because like Derrik said in the video you should go for whichever is bigger on the left side basically	If you add a zero to 34000 hundredths then you get 34thousandths and that is larger than 248thousandths	5.0
In the tenths what do we have	A four and a four	4.0
There we go	a three and a two	4.0
Is the three bigger or the two bigger	Three	4.0
Campbell pass that to Gerard	I get why Campbell thought that it was 248 because the eight is bigger than the zero and the fours are the same but she probably didnt see the three and the two	5.0
Sometimes we think of the zero and we think 248 is bigger than 34	Yes	1.0
Yes	You dont add to it you dont add to the zero	4.0
Hold on Campbells talking	My answer was going to be zero and 248thousandths but then remembering the video I looked a bit closer and I saw that you can make zero and 34hundredths into zero and 34thousandths	5.0
Give it to Derrik	I have a connection with the people that thought it was 248000 thousandths	2.0
I have a connection with the people that thought it was 248000 thousandths	So this one time I was doing the same thing but just with the normal numbers and I thought that 2000 was bigger than 34	5.0
So this one time I was doing the same thing but just with the normal numbers and I thought that 2000 was bigger than 34	I would have been correct but the three was bigger than the two so Id have got that whole thing wrong	5.0
I would have been correct but the three was bigger than the two so Id have got that whole thing wrong	It was fun	1.0
We have to make the alligator mouth towards the bigger one so the alligator mouth is going to face which one		4.0
How did you know	Because the three is bigger than the two	5.0
Derrik	When I was in first grade we made this little joke with the alligator mouth and we would draw a teeth on it and say the alligator would always go for the bigger number	4.0
When I was in first grade we made this little joke with the alligator mouth and we would draw a teeth on it and say the alligator would always go for the bigger number	Until I got to like third grade or so I thought	1.0
Until I got to like third grade or so I thought	Why	1.0
Why	I used to say like	1.0
I used to say like	Even Stephens	1.0
Even Stephens	Oh my God	1.0
Oh my God	I dropped it	1.0
I dropped it	Oops	1.0
All right	They cant hear us over here	1.0
We got to move the decimal	How do you know	3.0
Now in this one we have a whole number so we have to start at which place	Ones	4.0
Lets look at this one	is it 225	4.0
Well who has the mic	I do	1.0
One in 2 tenths or 25 hundredths	One in two tenths	4.0
Pass it	Oops	1.0
Oops	One in 2tenths	4.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	Two in 500hundredths	4.0
Thats supposed to be 25hundredths	Sorry	1.0
Sorry	25hundredths	4.0
25hundredths	One in 2 tenths	4.0
One in 2 tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
One in 2tenths	One in 2tenths	2.0
How come you think its 25hundredths	Well at first I thought one was in the tenths and the two was in the hundredths so thats why I thought it was two to 2500 hundredths because I thought the one was in 10th place but then I looked up at the chalkboard and then I saw that was in the ones place	5.0
You agree with the one in 2tenths	I agree with the one in 2tenths	2.0
Give it to Derrik	I think I know why Donovan picked that 25000 thousandths or something like that	5.0
I think I know why Donovan picked that 25000 thousandths or something like that	Its because the two was before the decimal	5.0
Its because the two was before the decimal	I think thats why it made it look like it was bigger	5.0
Yes and down here I messed up	No worries it should have went 105	4.0
No worries it should have went 105	Yes and	2.0
Yes and	No its a big	2.0
No its a big	Student 4 0 and like 25	4.0
Student 4 0 and like 25	I also understand why Donovan would pick that	2.0
I also understand why Donovan would pick that	I was so close to picking it until I heard you say you made a mistake	4.0
I was so close to picking it until I heard you say you made a mistake	I dont blame Donovan on the mistake he made because	2.0
I dont blame Donovan on the mistake he made because	Neither do I	2.0
Neither do I	I would have definitely made that mistake if you wouldnt say if you didnt say	2.0
I would have definitely made that mistake if you wouldnt say if you didnt say	What would it look like if there were	1.0
Up here its right	I agree with Catherine but 25thousandths was my original answer before I saw the one and the ones or before Mrs Duncan said one and	2.0
Hi the Alligator mouth is going to face which way	One	4.0

Look and see what goes with four three	I wont put the first one down before I solve the one on my app	1.0
All right friends I want to show you	Did you put a zero here	2.0
Did you put a zero here	You can put a zero	4.0
You dont have to	Im so sad	1.0
Im so sad	18 to know which is	1.0
18 to know which is	I like sauce	1.0
I like sauce	Sauce is very	1.0
Okay	Well it	1.0
All right heres what I	Hand does	1.0
Can I show you guys something	You should say a	1.0
Can I show you something	Yes	1.0
Can I show you something	Shes talking to us	1.0
Unless I didnt see it right	Are we doing the math test	1.0
Okay so your pages today that youre doing	Do we have to Can we put the one like put on there	4.0
Do we have to Can we put the one like put on there	Or for you and we have 10 minutes schedule for the	1.0
Or for you and we have 10 minutes schedule for the	It sounds simple	1.0
It sounds simple	This is all	1.0
This is all	If you stop on time yes	1.0
If you stop on time yes	If she stops on time she only has 10 minutes	1.0
You are doing pages 121 and 122	Guys	1.0
Guys	We should get that	1.0
Will somebody push stop on the record and then hand me the microphone	I had a question about number one	3.0
I had a question about number one	I excel at  and Im very good at	1.0
I excel at  and Im very good at	Is that quotient correct	4.0
Is that quotient correct	Maybe I dont know if Im slowly solving the problem	1.0
No	Okay	1.0
Youre looking at problems in number one and thats what you came up with	Yes	1.0
Not looking good on that	Okay	1.0
Okay	I think Ill figure it out	1.0
I think you did	Thank you	1.0
If you would page 75	Thanks	1.0
Thanks	did I do right	1.0
did I do right	About right	1.0
About right	Oh boy	1.0
Oh boy	Are you going to use that	1.0
Are you going to use that	Are you going to use that	1.0
What have we been calling it	Intercept form	4.0
Intercept because were finding what kinds of intercepts	Xs	4.0
Okay which are also called roots and then in the calculator theyre called	Zeros	4.0
What did we discover about anything that has an even power	That it increases like that or its like that it bounces	1.0
It bounces off of the	Xaxis	4.0
So it either bounces off or hangs you know but	Does it touch the Xaxis	4.0
So go	I actually have a question	1.0
I actually have a question	When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	4.0
When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	how to do that	3.0
So its a different	Its pretty much	1.0
Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that	Okay	1.0
Okay	So its up to you	4.0
So its up to you	Thanks	1.0
Thanks	Yes	1.0
Yes	I mean Ill work	1.0
Match it first because then youre going to use the Xintercepts of the graph to write it in factor form	is exactly the intercept	4.0
Yes so do any of these actually bounce off the Xaxis	No but this is	4.0
Right but what we were talking about and let me put that back up for you	How do you put your factor in there	3.0
is when I have a factor thats	When its a factor	4.0
Yes	Isnt B over there	4.0
Isnt B over there	Its rounded out	4.0
Its rounded out	Its rounded out	4.0
Its rounded out	Or theres like actually is figure out	1.0
Well youre going to first match it with the graph	What Im trying to do is Im trying to figure out the intercepts and then I can match it	4.0
But youre going to do the other way around today	But I dont like that	1.0
So thats the sequence today	How do we find the factor	3.0
How do we find the factor	Okay	1.0
Okay	So I know  quadratics	1.0
So I know  quadratics	So anything other than	1.0
So the direction of this would be similar to the direction of what	If they were	1.0
If a line is going like that is this positive or negative	Positive	4.0
The degree is	Odd	4.0
Thats right	Okay	1.0
Then typically if theres one two three directions its a	Okay	1.0
Okay	How do you do the	1.0
How do you do the	So which ones with that and ones with	3.0
So which ones with that and ones with	Im going to come make a case	1.0
Im going to come make a case	Is there even a name	1.0
Is there even a name	Its this little cute bundle of joy	1.0
Its this little cute bundle of joy	call me Mongoloid Jack	1.0
Is there something thats distinct about those two	Both are negative	4.0
You can probably use that ones going to be a little maybe a little quicker to figure out	All right	1.0
All right	So C is	4.0
So C is	So why is this	3.0
So why is this	to get one of those	1.0
to get one of those	C is	4.0
C is	Honestly its not too confusing but	1.0
Youre right	Death Valley	1.0

Eyes upfront please	This is from the top	1.0
This is from the top	Yes	1.0
Yes	From the top	1.0
Thats a cubic	What about	1.0
In all of these cases after we factor out that monomial we have a quadratic so we have to use our skills for	You can use synthetic divisions	4.0
Pete could you read this for me	For some polynomials you can factor by grouping pairs of terms that are of common monomial factor	1.0
For some polynomials you can factor by grouping pairs of terms that are of common monomial factor	The pattern for factoring by grouping is shown below	1.0
I feel like they left out a little intermediate step	We could split the term	4.0
What do I have to do with those two exponents	You multiply them	4.0
Then notice its as if thats X and thats X	Do they cancel	4.0
Its as if this is X2  5X  6	Okay	1.0
What are the factors of six that add up to five	Three and two	4.0
Thatll multiply to that then theyll add to that so now if I understand that X is really P3	You can use it to put it back down	4.0
Yes Joel	Joel 3P2 is that just transferred down because its not in the quadratic	4.0
Right because my X2 here is really P3	Other than the one on the outside theyre always	4.0
Pete	I cant factor after Exploration 2	4.0
Did you put it in the calculator and find the zeros	Im supposed to do that	1.0
12   3  4 with a remainder of	Two	4.0
Now what if I did 12   5	Two with a remainder of two	4.0
Is 5 a factor of 12	No	1.0
The other way of doing it well whats always true of an X intercept	Y  0	4.0
If I plug in two and why would I be plugging in two	Theres	1.0
It doesnt equal zero that is not a factor Joel	I have a question	1.0
Is it on task	Yes sort of sort of sort of sort of	1.0
I figured it wasnt going to be a direct solid yes	Its a little bit	4.0
Its a little bit	I was thinking I was just plugging in some random values for X on my calculator	1.0
I was thinking I was just plugging in some random values for X on my calculator	When does it get to the point where its a straight line because I got it	3.0
When does it get to the point where its a straight line because I got it	Wait vertical or horizontal	3.0
Wait vertical or horizontal	Its just the equation is a straight line	4.0
Its just the equation is a straight line	It just goes	4.0
You mean it doesnt	It has no curve it just	4.0
Thats what thats called where it stops	Isnt that the origin	4.0
What	Wouldnt that be the origin for that	4.0
I dont know if its for that one it could be any place	I just wanted to know why its something to calculate	3.0
I just wanted to know why its something to calculate	Except for that it would be if I	4.0
Hes talking about if I have I cubic that does this where it does have mins and maxes it just has a point of inflection	No I mean what it does is it goes up line up	4.0
No I mean what it does is it goes up line up	It looks like an undefined slope	4.0
Ill have to look at that	It has no slope it just shrinks	4.0
It has no slope it just shrinks	It looks like a straight but it just hasnt really  because if it was a straight line the slope would be undefined	5.0
It looks like a straight but it just hasnt really  because if it was a straight line the slope would be undefined	Its confusing me	3.0
Now because my remainder is	Zero	4.0
Then thats a factor	Is that how it works	1.0
Were going to stop here and go to the extra practice thats in the journal and were going to work on that	A cube is a straight line	4.0
A cube is a straight line	Its actually not straight at all	2.0
No yes	You  four different times in the window	1.0
Yes	I just	1.0
Did you know that youre	Yes	1.0
How are we going to rewrite those	Its and quantity and 3 and 3	4.0
Joanne whats step one	Isolate the radical on one side of the equation	4.0
For this particular example whats our first step going to be David	Isolate the radical	4.0
Whats it going to take for us to get the radical by itself to divide by	Yes divide by two	4.0
Whats step two Tobias	Get rid of the plus one	4.0
Jill	I can get rid of the radical	4.0
How do we know when we can get rid of the radical Tobias	When theres nothing outside of it and theres no other part of the equation thats like it	4.0
Tobias	Dont you multiply it by itself	4.0
Dont you multiply it by itself	Dont you square it	4.0
Simplifying this Id end up with x1 but then I have this	Its not going to go over	4.0
Yes so have I simplified	No	1.0
In this case what do you think we should do Cordelia	Then we have to solve the resulting equation	4.0
Jason	Square it	4.0
Square it	You raise each side of the equation to the same exponent so then youd square both sides	4.0
Eliza what are we going to do to get x by itself now	You minus one	4.0
Minus one yes so we end up with x equals	Three	4.0
Three	Three	2.0
Whats the next step Nadia	Youre done	4.0
Were good	No	1.0
No	No	2.0
Joel	You have to substitute the xy back into the	4.0
Now what was step one Joel	Isolate the radical	4.0
When we add one to both sides will we have isolated the radical or are we done with that	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	2.0
Whats step two	We cube each side	4.0
Whatever we have here and whats 33 going to give us	Twentyseven	4.0
To get x by itself here whats my two steps	Cube each side	4.0
Weve done that were left with this two step equation	Add nine to each side then divide by two	4.0
Perfect now why did you say add nine as the first step instead of dividing by two first	Because otherwise you would still have the nine remaining	5.0
What would 9 2 give me	Four point five	4.0
Can you guys think what is the math reason that we use that says why we add nine first	Order of operations	4.0
Say that again	Order of operations	4.0
Refresh our memory	Its reverse order of operations	4.0
Yes you	I have a question about	3.0
I have a question about	If you add 9 to either side youd be left with 36 then if you divide by 2 you get left with 18 but if you divide it by 2 and 27 then you get	5.0
Yes yes you just simplify	Its not	1.0
Its not	Its not so good	4.0
First three problems on that extra piece of paper you got	Weve probably done the two on that	4.0
Weve probably done the two on that	Is that  equations	4.0
Isolate the radical	Isolated the radical	1.0
Brittany we havent heard much from you so could you read the big paragraph	Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	1.0
Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	C solutions are called x solutions	1.0
C solutions are called x solutions	When you use  you should always check each apparent solution in the original equation	1.0
Could you read that attend to precision	Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	1.0
Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	Consider the equation  x3	1.0
Consider the equation  x3	This equation has no real solution	1.0
This equation has no real solution	However you obtain x9 after squaring each side	1.0
In this particular example Brittany whats step one	Isolate the thing	4.0
Weve isolated the radical so step two then	Get rid of the radical	4.0
Get rid of the radical so in this case we would raise it to	A second power	4.0
A second power and we would end up with x29	Yes	1.0
Yes	Wait what	1.0
Wait what	No x9	4.0
If I plug nine back in here whats  9	Three	4.0
Thats showing us that you dont always get the right answer in these problems and so were going to go through some of those	Technicallycould you just not check it and understand that if its equal to a negative then its not going to have a solution	4.0
Brittany whats step number one	Isolate the radical	4.0
Brittany	Yes	1.0
What do I have to do to isolate the radical here	Its already isolated	4.0
Step two was	Get rid of the radical	4.0
What am I going to do to both sides	Square	4.0
Square both sides	Now were getting spicy	1.0
Why are we getting spicy	Foil	4.0
We have to distribute the	I still dont know the foil is	1.0
Thats okay because foil is	Just one method of it	4.0
Whats going to happen here Brittany	Those cancel out	4.0
What happened between here and here	I dont know	1.0
I dont know	You foiled it	4.0
Ive got one x there and another x there for two over there	table method	4.0
Table method I think is a great way of organizing to multiply those	I agree	1.0
Whats step three of the process	Solve for x	4.0
Joel what are we going to do	Im gonna subtract the 1	4.0
What are you thinking	You could subtract 7x and subtract 15 and just factor your brand new trinomial from there	5.0
I could do that and what would I end up with over here	Zero	4.0
Equals zero	Establishing zero	4.0
What would be left over here is an x2 combining these	A negative I guess	4.0
Combining those	Minus 14	4.0
Are there factors of negative 14 that add up to 7	Yes	1.0
My x values are	Negative two and seven	4.0
Whats the last step Brittany	You solve for x	4.0
We did solve for x	Oh I knew that	1.0
What comes right after that	We plug it back in and check and make sure	4.0
This is that example of an extraneous solution	an example of a headache	1.0
Yes	If I remember it correctly but Im not sure  of the solutions could be correct	4.0
Thankfully this side looks a whole lot less complex	Its really easy to do it	1.0
Now what do you think were going to need to do	Just simplify	4.0
Theres a plus two and a three over here	Also the x	4.0
There is an x and an x over here	You would just subtract in both sides	4.0
Where are we going to put everything Tobias	I would first of all just subtract all the constants so I would subtract two and one in both sides	4.0
What happens over here	Youre getting rid of the entire three because that equals three so you can	5.0
We are simplifying its getting more simple as we go	Then you subtract x from both sides which will get you negative two x	4.0
Then	Then you divide both sides by two	4.0
Divide by two that gets rid of that	That gets you back to negative x and then you just square both sides and then it just gives you x2x2	5.0
Brittany after we isolate the radical what do we do	Yes	1.0
What are we going to do	Factor	4.0
Do I want to subtract all of this or subtract that	Subtract the x in the negative two	4.0
Why would I prefer to move these over here instead of moving that over here	To keep the leading coefficient positive	4.0
Are there factors of negative two that add up to negative one	Yes	1.0
They would be	Negative two or positive one	4.0
In these cases if we have calculators which were not going to have the calculators on the test	Also these arent that hard	1.0
Also these arent that hard	They are only basic equations	4.0
They are only basic equations	Its not complex stuff	1.0
That last one when we solved it even though there were a lot of steps to it there wasnt anything we couldnt do	going to make us graph that by hand	1.0
Describe the translations from the parent function kind of thing	Are we going to have graphs on the level threes	1.0
Im not making the test this time	Is the extraneous answer always going to be when x is negative	4.0
I dont know well look for patterns and see	In looking for patterns it looks like whenever x is negative	5.0
Whats the one answer that works	x2	4.0
Thats the one that worked	could have just waited for the question to be answered	1.0
Thats okay	I have a question	1.0
Yes	Whos making the test	1.0
Brittany whats going to be our first step	Isolate the radical	4.0
We cant if theres two of them	Square	4.0
Yes were going to square both sides	when one is a cube root and one is a square root	4.0
You dont want to do that when	Can we write these on the paper	1.0
You got all of those	Yes	1.0
Have you checked your answers yet	Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	5.0
Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	Im good at math	1.0
Think about it this way if I have negative two x minus two x what would I have	Negative four	4.0
Joel did you all do the problem	Christian Branson can die	1.0
Christian Branson can die	Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	1.0
Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	Im just having a moment right now	1.0
Im just having a moment right now	Okay guys okay	1.0
Vijay lets come back to your seat	I was helping Joel	1.0
Whats step one for this type of problem because we just switched problems	What I would do is to make that into a radical and then write	4.0
Or we could treat is as the fourth root to x cubed	Subtract two	4.0
Subtract two	Isolate it	4.0
Joel	Isolate the exponent	4.0
Matt whats our first step	The first step is to minus two	4.0
On the left side we get an	Eight	4.0
Now what do we do Cordelia	You have to like do the flippy thingy	4.0
The flippy thingy	Where are you making it into the radical	4.0
What are we going to flip	The three fourth thing	4.0
What do we call that when we flip it	I dont know but you flip it	1.0
I dont know but you flip it	Reciprocal	2.0
Reciprocal	Yes reciprocal	1.0
Because three fourth times fourthirds equals	One	4.0
How do you want to think about eight to the fourthirds power	Would it be  fourth root of eight	4.0
Would it be  fourth root of eight	You find the cube root of eight and thats two and then you multiply that by the other exponent	5.0
Last step here Jared	Divide both sides by two	4.0
X is going to equal	Eight	4.0
We have our solution	That is ridiculously simple	1.0
That is ridiculously simple	I have a question	1.0
Yes	Its basically when youre doing the raise each sides of four thirds youre putting the power of the reciprocal of both sides	4.0
Whats our first step Brittany	Well it already is isolated	4.0
What is isolated	The rational exponent so like that	4.0
What are we going to raise both sides to	Two over one	4.0
Two over one just is	Squared	4.0
Were just going to square both sides	Do you have to use brackets or can you use more parentheses	3.0
Typically you see if theres parentheses that use brackets but more parentheses is fine	would use the bigger parentheses	4.0
Joel what are you going to do if I got a quadratic a constant and a linear term	Subtract the x over	4.0
Subtract the x over okay	Then you get 30 equals x	4.0
Then what do I do	Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	4.0
Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	No because thats x squared	2.0
Go ahead	You have to subtract the 30 Im assuming	4.0
If we subtract that then this whole thing is going to equal	Zero	4.0
Are there factors of negative 30 that add up to negative 1	Oh yes	1.0
Oh yes	Five and six	4.0
Which one has to be negative	Negative six	4.0
Joel when we have quadratic constant and linear terms what do we want to do	Factor it	4.0
Were going to go towards factoring but in between what do we want to do	Set it equal to zero	4.0
When we see we have those three different types of terms we want to set it equal to zero we factor so my two possible solutions here are going to be	Positive six and negative five	4.0
Yes	Can we take a break	1.0
Whats two to the third equal	Two times two times two	4.0
Two times two times two equals	Eight	4.0
For example can we take the square root of a negative number	No	1.0
Is that okay	Yes	1.0
Brittany what do we have to do	Divide by three	4.0
Weve got to divide by three so we do that first	Equals four	4.0
Weve got that now and then what are we going to do to both sides	Get rid of the radical	4.0
Four squared is		4.0
We then	Add one	4.0
Add one and so were left with this expression that x can be any values that are less than or equal to 17	I think  does the inequality symbol ever switch because  divided by negative number you have to switch it	5.0
How could I change my original	Multiply with negative	4.0
X is in between what two numbers	1 and 17	4.0
Sure is it already queued up or	No	1.0
No okay	Do exponents switch to inequality	4.0
Tobias you better be nice to me	I will	1.0
I will	Dont worry	1.0
Dont worry	Im not going to bully you	1.0
Im not going to bully you	Its just amazing	1.0
If youre in Group C you will work on Number 10	Ms Herd	1.0
Yes	Turn the page please	1.0
So youve already done some of this	Yes	1.0
Matthew Owen can you move those chairs for me so I can push the back	Why are they over there	1.0
the carpet	No	1.0
No	Seat	1.0
Thank you Claire	Are they recording	1.0
Are they recording	I dont think they are	1.0
I dont think they are	Keep going	1.0
Keep going	I just caught the red light and the flash	1.0
I just caught the red light and the flash	I said it youre on this side Matthew	1.0
I said it youre on this side Matthew	Youre up right here	1.0
Youre up right here	Until youre like Really close together	1.0
Until youre like Really close together	All right	1.0
All right	Ms Herd what are these for	1.0
Ms Herd what are these for	I would normLily want to be partnered	1.0
Theyre just listening to the words were talking about in math	I dont think  maybe its recording	1.0
It might be at your desk	Theres four at each table	1.0
Theres four at each table	Right	1.0
Right	Am I right	1.0
Am I right	All right	1.0
All right	Wait	1.0
Wait	Is she Fern	1.0
Is she Fern	my choice for us girls or should we just stay where we are	1.0
my choice for us girls or should we just stay where we are	Lets stay	1.0
Lets stay	I dont think Nolan he doesnt want to do it	1.0
So friends what number are we starting with	We had to	1.0
Is this an extra	Yes	1.0
Lily is it okay if I set this on your desk	Okay	1.0
Hannah will you read it for us	Draw pictures of these turns using your arc to show the direction of each one	1.0
Draw pictures of these turns using your arc to show the direction of each one	The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	1.0
What is Number 11 asking us for	Its asking us to draw pictures of turns using an arc to the direction of each one	4.0
So what do we have	The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	4.0
What does that look like	Excuse me	1.0
So half a turn	So were facing right here and then I think we have to figure out	4.0
Stand up	to do a half turn	4.0
So if were standing and were facing the front right	That way youre facing this way the arrow	4.0
Are we going clockwise or counterclockwise	Clockwise	4.0
So we would go half turn	We would just draw an arrow this way	4.0
So it would look like	Wait	1.0
Wait	How are we	1.0
How are we	Can I see	1.0
Can I see	Okay	1.0
Okay	I get that	1.0
So it was like this and a half turn would mean now its	Like that	4.0
Daniel well tell us what youre thinking	Im thinking we show a clock mostly turns right so we should do it left in like a quarter of a half turn	5.0
So what do you mean by a quarter of a halfturn	Instead of doing a full half turn you want to cut	5.0
Instead of doing a full half turn you want to cut	If you do a full half turn and just erase half of that	5.0
Im hearing you say half of half is one quarter	Yes	1.0
Or onefourth times two is one half	Yes	1.0
So that would look like one quarter turn counterclockwise would be what	Yes	1.0
Yes	Like that	1.0
So now it would be facing this way	Yes	1.0
You guys agree disagree	I agree I think	2.0
Noah what do you need honey	Im thinking	1.0
Sam what are you working on honey	Im doing the same	1.0
There you go	What about one through nine	1.0
Lets keep going friends	Wait	1.0
Wait	Then how would this one be	3.0
Then how would this one be	Like that	1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
Why Zoe	Because we are turning that way	5.0
What are our choices	Ninety to a hundred 180  180	4.0
You need to look at where the arch is on the angle	I think that would be 90 through 180 degrees because its like almost a right angle its just a tad bit	5.0
I think that would be 90 through 180 degrees because its like almost a right angle its just a tad bit	Yes	2.0
Yes	Its up to	1.0
Its up to	Well wait	1.0
Well wait	Yes	1.0
Yes	Nolans right	2.0
Nolans right	Nolans right	2.0
Nolans right	Nolans right with the 90 between 180	2.0
Tell me why youre doing that	I think we should maybe circle 90 to 180 degrees so that we know its that one	4.0
What did you guys get	We got 90 to 180	4.0
Acute obtuse or right	Obtuse	4.0
Lets do the next one	I think its a zero between 90	4.0
Talk to your team and tell your friends why	Because its less than like a 90degree turn	5.0
Because its less than like a 90degree turn	I think its zero through 90	4.0
Why	Zero to 90	4.0
How do you know	The angle is smaller than 90 degrees	4.0
How do you know	Because thats pointing this way	5.0
Because thats pointing this way	If it were a right angle or 90 degrees it would be like that and its	5.0
The line  would meet at a perfect  degrees	Pointing like that	4.0
So  you guys say acute	Yes	1.0
Would you please tell your teammates talk about what is symmetry	Symmetry its where its the same on both sides	4.0
The same what on both sides	If its the same  shape	4.0
The image would be reflective on a line of	I think we should first draw  because there are so many ways you can do it	5.0
I think we should first draw  because there are so many ways you can do it	Youre kind of like drawing	5.0
Youre kind of like drawing	So we got to go this we go to go this we got to go this	5.0
Only one line	Why	3.0
Why	No	1.0
No	Draw all the lines of symmetry	1.0
When it says draw all the lines of symmetry what I want to talk about on Number 13A is how many lines of symmetry will we be drawing	Four	4.0
Can I hold this up for a second	I dont know	1.0
I dont know	I came up with all those answers	1.0
If we drew a line right here could we fold it and both sides would match up perfectly it would be a reflection	Yes	1.0
On Number 14 what is a strategy to draw the other half	We could measure it	4.0
How did you know what to do	We could fold it in half and	4.0
Fern will you tell us how did you know what to do	Because I know its a square you could  a diamond and a Its half	5.0
On number 14 how do you know what to draw where	You just kind of look at it	4.0
You just kind of look at it	You kind of copy it	4.0
When you say look at it look at what	Look at the shape of it	4.0
Look at the shape of it	Its like	1.0
Its like	Or you could fold it the reflection	4.0
What youre thinking about is if it was flipped over the line if that figure was flipped over the line of symmetry what would it look like on the other side	Yes	1.0
Thats another way to check	Thats not	1.0
Thats not	Its not what	1.0
Its not what	She just did that on a math test	1.0
This is a clue to you what kind of problem are you going to have on Number 15	Were going to talk about it	1.0
Remember we need	Story	4.0
A single	Number	4.0
Okay	Three boys each want to buy a football and a science kit	1.0
Three boys each want to buy a football and a science kit	Together they have 65	1.0
Together they have 65	If each football costs 8 and each science kit costs 11 how much money will the boys have left over after theyve purchased the items	1.0
What is the problem asking and what are the steps	Or we could do three times and then we could do like	4.0
What are you guys thinking that Number 15 is asking us to find	I think its asking us to find how much it costs in total	4.0
I think its asking us to find how much it costs in total	No	2.0
No	Find	1.0
Part of it is	Find how much money the boys will have left over	4.0
Were going to find how much the total would be and then how much money is left after they buy those items	Yes	1.0
Whats our strategy for setting up this problem	I think I know	1.0
Tell me why you have three times eight	Because three times eight is the football and then three times 11 is the science kit and then minus	5.0
So the first thing you have to do is find that total	Dash was asking us	1.0
You want to find out how much money is it going to cost them to buy those items	6500	4.0
You could but is this addition or multiplication	Multiplication	4.0
Are you sure about that	Of course	1.0
Why would we need addition not multiplication	Because multiplication if we add this total and this total then you would multiply those  because that would be not the correct answer	5.0
How much do the Whats the other thing	Science kits	4.0
We put those two totals together	Then we can do equals	4.0
How much do the footballs cost	800	4.0
And how many boys are there	Three	4.0
Then we have	11	4.0
What do we need to do with these two amounts	What would that unknown letter be	3.0
Were going to be adding the two of them	Guys Im done	1.0
Guys Im done	Whats three times eight	3.0
Youre going to figure out both of these and then add those both together	What if its wrong	1.0
What if its wrong	Three times eight 24	5.0
Three times eight 24	Its not wrong	1.0
Its not wrong	You dont know that	2.0
You dont know that	I did all the math	1.0
I did all the math	I have no  and I have no	1.0
We are going to do a switch	What are you doing	1.0
If you were at the back table you are going to go to the desks now	Do we work with partners	1.0
If you are the desks you are going to head to the carpet	The answer is 45	4.0
Id like you to please turn to Number 11	Why is this split	1.0
Number 11	Number 11	1.0
If we are looking at this line right here and were turning it a half	A half turn	1.0
Were turning to the right	Oh your right	1.0
Now what is B asking us to do	One fourth turn counterclockwise	4.0
Instead of clockwise were going to	Left	4.0
How do we know how far to go	Its one fourth	4.0
Its one fourth	We did one whole right there so about 180 degrees	4.0
One hundred eighty is a half	Its going to be 270	4.0
If you have 1 how many quarters is one quarter	Four	4.0
Well how many quarters are in a dollar	Four	4.0
Michael can you read Number 12 for us	Estimate the size of the angle	1.0
Estimate the size of the angle	Circle the best answer	1.0
Anyone willing to share their thinking how they know	I think its zero through 90 number one because C right there it would probably be 90	5.0
What does a 90degree angle look like	It looks like that	1.0
A perfect	This ones like this	1.0
Liza	I think its the second one 90 degrees No 180 degrees to 270 because if this was 90 Wait	5.0
I think its the second one 90 degrees No 180 degrees to 270 because if this was 90 Wait	No	5.0
No	Yes if this was 90 itd be right here or	5.0
Is our arc	I cant see	1.0
Right here	No	1.0
Is it a little bigger than 90 degrees	Yes	1.0
But this is 180 is it all the way at 180	No	1.0
Talk to your partners	I think its obtuse	4.0
Say it out loud	Obtuse	4.0
Write down the word obtuse please	I already did	1.0
Go	I think its acute	4.0
I think its acute	Yes its acute	2.0
Yes its acute	Zero to 90	4.0
How do you know	I know because this one is going that like this and like Landon said its like an L if it was 90 degrees so it has to be 180 if its more up than that one because this one is kind of down  This ones straightup	5.0
Zero to 90 is acute	Oh I thought it was  that one is like this and it was more like	4.0
If the arc inside this 90degree mark that means it s less than 90 degrees	Thank you	1.0
Remember the lesson where we drew the lines of symmetry	No	1.0
That s a good thing we re revealing huh	Wait	1.0
Wait	What day was it	1.0
What day was it	It was Wednesday	1.0
Lucas tell us what you re thinking	The first one I thought because the square if you ve got a square piece of paper you could fold it one way which will be parallel to	5.0
If you drew a line down the middle and we folded it would the edges matchup	Yes	1.0
Yes	Then you could also do another line across	4.0
Like this	Yes	1.0
Yes	Because both lines are  all you could to do	4.0
What do you think	I think there should be across like through the middle	4.0
So what does that tell us	That either one two three there s three	4.0
Could there be four	Yes because it can go the other way	5.0
We folded it on this line of symmetry would the corners match up	Yes	1.0
You may	Ms Jackson just told us	1.0
Ms Jackson just told us	She said sometimes there could be as many lines as how many sides on a shape	4.0
Look we have one two How many lines of symmetry	Four	4.0
How many lines of symmetry on the next figure	One	4.0
What s the figure called	Pentagon	4.0
Pentagon	No	2.0
No	Trapezoid	2.0
Thats four sides	Trapezoid	4.0
Trapezoid	Well how would you fold it this way because this side is bigger than that side	3.0
What if we had If this is the figure	You re not folding it down	1.0
You re not folding it down	No	1.0
No	If you fold it that way it would be too big	5.0
See how it s similar to this	Yes but if you fold it from this side	4.0
Yes but if you fold it from this side	Yes	2.0
Yes	Why do you have that	3.0
I would fold it right here so that this corner would line up with this one	Wait because you couldn t go down the middle	5.0
It wouldn t match	Yes because if you fold it up it will just be a little off	5.0
Liza	With this one I think it s a quadrangle	4.0
With this one I think it s a quadrangle	I think	1.0
What does quadrangle mean	It s a foursided shape	4.0
You got it	Quad means four	5.0
Quad means four	Then it would be a square rectangle or slanted square	5.0
C looks like this	It s almost a square	4.0
What makes this not a square	Because the sides are more slanted than that	5.0
Do we have four right angles	Yes	1.0
We don t have four right angles but we have four sides	What also doesn t make any square is that a square has of four lines of symmetry and this one only has	4.0
If we folded it here what would happen	It would be overlapped	4.0
It would be overlapped	It got overlapped but	4.0
If the corners wouldn t match up perfectly that s not a line of symmetry	Unless you folded it open	5.0
Could we fold it here	Yes	1.0
Would this match perfectly with this	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
What about here	Yes	1.0
Are there any others	I think we can do a line like fold it	4.0
This way	You can t fold a line down the middle	4.0
Is it going to match up	No	4.0
We cannot have a line of symmetry here	That one will come down here and then that one will come over there	4.0
Would it line up	No	1.0
These are the only two lines of symmetry on this figure	Like  said you can t do that way because	4.0
What did I start with here Liza	Two and one half	4.0
Gage where s Do you need to go seeTor you guys are at the table	Logans okay	1.0
Matthew and Noah are you ready to start with us on Number 11	Yes	1.0
There s one right here	No	1.0
No	I understand	1.0
Is this one of your papers	That s Logan s	1.0
Is this yours too	Yes	1.0
Thank you Mia	Number 11 says draw pictures of these turns using an arc to show the direction of each one	1.0
Number 11 says draw pictures of these turns using an arc to show the direction of each one	The vertex of the angle in one side have already been drawn	1.0
The vertex of the angle in one side have already been drawn	It will be like we re making an angle	4.0
Noah tell us how you knew what to do	Wait	1.0
Wait	I havent done it yet	1.0
I havent done it yet	I ll tell you	1.0
I ll tell you	It set for a 120 clockwise	4.0
It set for a 120 clockwise	I drew the other half of the angle which is just	4.0
I drew the other half of the angle which is just	I drew half of the clock	4.0
I drew half of the clock	I drew half of a circle and an arrow at the right end	4.0
Noah does yours match mine	Oh but is it okay if I	1.0
Yes	Yes my	1.0
Yes my	Wait but that would be turning counterclockwise	4.0
Wait but that would be turning counterclockwise	If you put the arrow above then it would be turning counterclockwise and it says to turn clockwise	4.0
If you put the arrow above then it would be turning counterclockwise and it says to turn clockwise	No hes still moving	2.0
No hes still moving	Hes still moving clockwise	2.0
Yes	Hes going to the left to the right	2.0
Okay and B is instead of a halfturn London will you read B for us 11B	Onefourth turn counterclockwise	1.0
Were going onequarter of a turn counterclockwise	I did it like this	4.0
I did it like this	Oh I did a quarter	4.0
Oh I did a quarter	Thats why	1.0
You got that	I did it like this	4.0
Matthew look at my counterclockwise	I cant see yours	1.0
I cant see yours	Oh I did it that way	4.0
Sam Number 12 is you	Estimate the sides of the angle	1.0
Estimate the sides of the angle	Circle the best answer	1.0
Then ask your friends around you if they agree	I think its in between 90 and 180 degrees	4.0
I think its in between 90 and 180 degrees	Can I share my thinking	1.0
Can I share my thinking	I agree	2.0
Okay	It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned	5.0
It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned	It looks like its more than 90 degrees	5.0
It looks like its more than 90 degrees	Its more than a hundred degrees	5.0
They might agree disagree addon	I agree because the arrow is pointing to the right so its not turning all the way	2.0
How do we know this angle is less than 180 degrees	I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	5.0
I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	Its not facing it and its higher so its not going to be that	5.0
Got it	The  it makes its not one side to the other side	4.0
So 180 degrees would mean this line would be straight across	Yes	1.0
So we know its less than 180	Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	5.0
Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	Also	1.0
So 180 degrees would be this line all the way across right here	Its bigger than that and	4.0
Does that make sense	Yes	1.0
I love it	I was going to say you can sometimes get confused of which way its going because or if its going this way you know its not going to be  its going the other way	5.0
What do we name this angle	Obtuse	4.0
Obtuse	Obtuse	4.0
Write it down	Oh okay	1.0
Oh okay	I thought it meant like	1.0
Okay	I think I actually know	1.0
the next one	Estimate the sides of the angle circle the best answer	1.0
Estimate the sides of the angle circle the best answer	To me it looks like its the other way	4.0
What do you mean by the other way	Well not going a different way but like kind of  on the A and B	4.0
Matthew our three choices are right here zero through 90 90 to 180 or 180 to 270	I think zero to 90 because if it was here that would be 260 and it couldnt be behind 260	5.0
I think zero to 90 because if it was here that would be 260 and it couldnt be behind 260	If it was just slightly there past zero	5.0
Can you have someone to addon to your thinking please	Logan	1.0
Logan	I was doing this in my head	1.0
I was doing this in my head	I was imagining a line here and this is 90 degrees	4.0
Do you agree with Matthew that its less than 90	Yes	2.0
Youre showing why	I think it would be zero through	4.0
Do you see how Logan drew in where the 90 degrees is	Angle BOX is less than 90 degrees	4.0
And then he said	I got BOX	4.0
Finish what you were saying	the angle BOX	4.0
the angle BOX	This would be angle	4.0
This would be angle	I thought that is should be like zero through 89 instead of 0 through 90 because I think this is an acute angle and acute is different than	5.0
Less than 90	Yes and	1.0
I see what youre saying	A 90 is a complete different angle	4.0
Thats me	Oh I just realized	1.0
Oh I just realized	This entire group is in	1.0
This entire group is in	Yes	1.0
Yes	Really	1.0
Really	I think she purposely did it	1.0
I think she purposely did it	Im not	1.0
Im not	Thats true	1.0
Thats true	Oh yes	1.0
Oh yes	She did it so we could actually	1.0
What kind of angle is it and how do you name it	Acute	4.0
Acute	Its acute	4.0
It is acute but its also less than 90 degrees	Im not	1.0
Im not	It is true but	1.0
Now I want to tell you I have to run to my next group in another class but you all are responsible for doing these two symmetry problems	Yes	1.0
Yes	We can name it	1.0
When youre done with 14 youre going to share your answer	Wait Owen is 13	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
Okay	All right	1.0
All right	Go guys	1.0
Go guys	Because if we drew  like a bus on it	4.0
Have a great rest of your snowy day	No	1.0
No	Its kind of like an asterisk	1.0
Lets read the number	318500	4.0
Why did they have parenthesis	Because they were	1.0
Look at this persons why are they using parentheses	They are writing the multiplication	2.0
Yes theyre showing keep this together keep this together so what do parentheses do	They keep things together	4.0
Are you trying to group this and this	No	1.0
Try this one how do we say the number	07100	4.0
What is that	Two	4.0
Onetenth plus one times	Because you moved that	4.0
Lets say the number	90615000	4.0
Are you trying to group that together	No	1.0
Do you need that	No	1.0
Like if youre doing 9 x 100 youre grouping that  6 x 1 you would be grouping that does that make sense	Yes	1.0
Thats better	I think Ive finished	1.0
So if you have a question youre like This part doesnt make sense to me stay there  That makes sense	Yes	1.0
This is right	No I know this ones right	4.0
This is the tenth to the zero so what should it be	6 x 10 to the 0	4.0
Or should it be 10 to go first	10 the first	1.0
Because you want one zero there right	Yes	1.0
One would be 10 to the 0	10 to the 0	1.0
Yes so it should be 10 to the 0	Youre right	1.0
Yes so that is right do you see why	Yes	1.0
Yes	I was just trying to go for a	1.0
I was just trying to go for a	I had the one there and I was like No	1.0
I had the one there and I was like No	It had to be a zero	4.0
In comes in switch in comes in whats 15 of 10	15 of 10	1.0
So 10 into how many groups	Two	4.0
So 10   5 is	25	4.0
No you multiply or something I dont know what you did	Dividing	4.0
If we have 10 counters and we had to make them into five groups how many would be in each group	Five	4.0
No wheres your	Heres again	1.0
Im confused about the talking	You said talk again	1.0
No does it say that in the directions	You talk about what you know	1.0
This is what we were just doing at the table	I know	1.0
How many groups are we making	Five	4.0
Five so 10   5 is how many	Five	4.0
Youd have five in each group	Two	4.0
Now do you get what to do	Yes	1.0
You divide the big number by the only group youre putting here so 10   5 is	10   5	1.0
Noah	I got two because I drew a fraction circle	4.0
Im confused about that part	but I was confused about what I was going to do so I divided	4.0
How does this work	You see how many groups of five	4.0
How many groups of what	Five	4.0
dividing it by	Four	4.0
Read this with me please	I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	1.0
Lets try that again	That was weird	1.0
That was weird	I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	1.0
Where did Anferny go	Here	1.0
So theyre right here what do I do	You find dividing the number of  for the group of two	4.0
Why five groups	Because youre giving away a group	5.0
Im finding 15	15 of 10	4.0
So if I have 15 how many are in 15	Two	4.0
If you know what 15 is that was two but then you got three of them so 2 x 3	Six	4.0
Does that make sense	Yes	1.0
Yes try this one	15 x 10	4.0
15 of 15 is	Three	4.0
35 of 15 would be	Nine	4.0
Why	Because its three groups	5.0
Miya	Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	5.0
Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	5.0
Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	5.0
Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	5.0
Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	5.0
Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	Then we do 6 x 3 which is 18	5.0
Why are we multiplying it by three	Because the rule is 35 instead of 15 so youd have to multiply it by three	5.0
Felicia	Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	5.0
Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	That means youll have to take the 10 in the first one and the answer was 2 and then you have to multiply it by 3 to get the out of the next one	5.0
Kayla tell us what you were thinking	The problem was all the ends are multiples of five so that way you can easily and mentally divide them by five but you had a number thats not a multiple of five meaning youre going to have a remainder or a fraction	5.0
The problem was all the ends are multiples of five so that way you can easily and mentally divide them by five but you had a number thats not a multiple of five meaning youre going to have a remainder or a fraction	Then we thought it would be hard to then multiply that fraction or the remainder by three	5.0
Do you get it	Yes	1.0
If you find 15 finding 35 is just multiplying it by three right	Yes	1.0
Does your drawing help you to understand this	Yes	1.0
Eyes up at the Ms Carter	So I used rectangles to  because youre shading 15 of the whole which is 10	5.0
So I used rectangles to  because youre shading 15 of the whole which is 10	So I shaded in 15 of it because were finding 15 and we know that its two because	5.0
How do you know thats two	Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2	5.0
Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2	So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	5.0
So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	5.0
Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	Then since theres three twos we want to add them all together and that would be six	5.0
That explains your model right	Yes	1.0
Would that work	Yes	1.0
Is that what were doing	No	1.0
Partner Bs turn to talk first	I get it	1.0
Okay	Now I get it	1.0
Talk with your partner how you found 15	Three	4.0
Do you see why	Yes	1.0
Does that make sense	Yes that makes sense now	1.0
And flash	Five	4.0
How did you get five Eli	I got five and I know the multiplication said it is 10	5.0
I got five and I know the multiplication said it is 10	I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50	5.0
I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50	I know that 5 x10  50 and thats why I got five	5.0
Could you do it by dividing too	Yes	1.0
Somebody that did it as division explain their thinking Rowdy	I did 50 divided 10 and I was trying to see how many groups of 10 were in 50 and I know that it is five	5.0
Once you find what 15 is thats like the one but then you have three of them so you multiply those	Timesing the numerator	4.0
What would you do Lexie	The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	5.0
The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	Yes 10th right	5.0
Yes 10th right	So I thought the 50 would be so I had a dividing and multiplying and then once you know that thats five you would multiply it by seven because youre finding 710 so you would have seven fives seven times five is 35	5.0
Why is it three times four Gracey	Three times four because if you have four groups of three yes it would be three times four because	5.0
Talk with your shoulder partner about why thats eight times eight	like and then	1.0
like and then	is eight times eight	4.0
Because theres eight	Yes because	1.0
Emma why is it eight times eight	It will be eight times eight because youre basically taking the two numbers from the problem then multiplying them	5.0
Thats true but why is it eight times eight	Itll also be eight times eight because you have eight stamps and eight rows	5.0
So theres a group of eight eight different times	Yes	1.0
And flash	Me I know	1.0
Go	It will be eight times 12	4.0
It will be eight times 12	12 oranges	4.0
Right	I found a way  and I got back at where its 60	4.0
David	Six times 12	4.0
Why is six bags of oranges with 12 in each bag six times 12	Because there are six bags with 12 oranges in each	5.0
Did I say it wrong	Yes	1.0
Yes	You said	1.0
Talk with your partner about why its 34 times eight	Well	1.0
Did you already talk yet	eight times 34 because	4.0
Why is it represented that way Emma	Its represented that way because you have 34 of one bag that has eight carrots	5.0
Brandon	Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	5.0
Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	5.0
Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	5.0
Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	Well its not the opposite Im just saying its not 10 times 15 its like 15 of 10	5.0
Kaya	Another way to really to visualize it is if youre thinking of one whole and one whole times itself so if youre multiplying one whole by 34 youre then getting 34 of the whole	5.0
Should one person be dominating	No	1.0
If you finish I do have a game	Nine divided by	4.0
Nine divided by	Okay	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
Okay	So I guess it will be 23 of whatever like 23 of 12	5.0
So I guess it will be 23 of whatever like 23 of 12	So then weve got to figure out the odd number	5.0
So then weve got to figure out the odd number	We basically do  make it easier so I can explain easier for you	5.0
We basically do  make it easier so I can explain easier for you	13 of 12 and then we just times that by three	5.0
Nice job	13 of six is	4.0
13 of 12 is four but they have 23	Oh okay	1.0
Oh okay	So four times two would be eight	5.0
You see your fix up there	I think  are erasable	1.0
Yes because you wouldnt be allowed to use it even if it works	Yes	1.0
Keep working together	Three	4.0
If you have six of these heres six whats 13	13 would be	4.0
So whats 13	Two	4.0
Two but you have 23 so that would be	Eight	4.0
So how much is that	Four	4.0
You see why its four	Yes	1.0
So 13 is how many	Three	4.0
So 23 is	Six	4.0
Okay	Were doing all that	1.0
Keep going	How much is	1.0
So	Oh this will be times three	4.0
Two times three is	It would be	1.0
Two times three is	Two times its six	4.0
You found 14 because if you have eight things	Oh so now I have to find 34 Oh okay	4.0
Do you see what your fix up is	Yes	1.0
Whats 14 of eight	14 of eight	1.0
Yes	Two	4.0
So if you know 14 is two what would 34 be	That is multiplication	4.0
Thats what multiplication is finding fraction of	Oh so its kind of the same thing	4.0
Do you see why its still multiplication	Yes	1.0
14 is two so 34 would be	Two	4.0
Not two	Yes two times	4.0
14 is two	It should be two times three	4.0
Because 14 is two but you have 34	Then you got to times it with that	4.0
But you have three of them so	Its six	4.0
Twenty divided by four is	Five	4.0
Whats 14 of 16	Four	4.0
But you have three of them so you have	Twelve	4.0
You got this	Yes	1.0
Whats 14 of eight	14 of eight would be four	4.0
So 2 x 3 is	Six	4.0
So whats 14 of 20	14 of 20 would be six	4.0
14 of 20 would be six	No	2.0
Twenty divided by four is	Twenty divided by four	1.0
Twenty divided by four	Four	4.0
So five is 14 but how many fourths do we have	Three	4.0
Five times three is	Fifteen	4.0
We have  15	Yes exactly	1.0
Does that make sense	Mmhmm	1.0
14 of 16 is	Four	4.0
So then three of those would be	Would be 12	4.0
Twenty is	Now you have	1.0
Therefore	Seven	4.0
So seven times three is	Seven times three is 21	4.0
Does that help	Yes	1.0
Yes	Do you think five and six	4.0
Would you need counters to do them all	No	1.0
You guys having fun	Yes	1.0
Now you need two  Are we in number six	Yes number six	1.0
Yes number six	Maybe Ill	1.0
So three times eight is	Sixteen	4.0
Twentyfour	Twentyfour	1.0
Twentyfour	Yes	1.0
Whats the number	The number we found	1.0
810 times	810 times 30	4.0
There you go like	Was it 30 or 10	3.0
Im going to bring your homework around	Hi my name is Kai	1.0
What would be an efficient way to generate those fractions Brody G	Using the multiplication maam	4.0
Okay so whats the saying that we have for that	Whatever youre do to the top you do to the bottom	4.0
No maybe somebody might have taken them home	I dont know	1.0
What is one use for equivalent fractions Samantha	One use for equivalent fractions in the real world you could use them to do	4.0
One use for equivalent fractions in the real world you could use them to do	You could  them	1.0
You could  them	You would need some equivalent fractions if youre trying to add onefourth or  into one half of the  used so that way you know how much  only total	4.0
You would need some equivalent fractions if youre trying to add onefourth or  into one half of the  used so that way you know how much  only total	That way you can use the multiplication rule or the common denominators to look through that when you want to figure out how much total	4.0
River did you have an idea of another use that wasnt adding and subtracting	When you find a different answer to something else and you dont want to use the same answer like everybody else is using you could do that	4.0
I like that you came up with something good job but why would you want to do that	It doesnt answer  know it  and you want to try something different	5.0
ALexis	fraction Well not really the fraction but two of the numbers the numerator and the denominator	4.0
fraction Well not really the fraction but two of the numbers the numerator and the denominator	You could  into half instead of	4.0
Hunter	I said if you had to add to two eighths	4.0
Ainsley	You could use equivalent fractions to find common denominators	4.0
What are you saying	The equivalent fraction you could find the common denominator with them	4.0
Victoria	Its similar to ALexiss in a way	2.0
Its similar to ALexiss in a way	Lets say you have to build something and its a project similar when youve got two numbers that you cant visualize	4.0
Lets say you have to build something and its a project similar when youve got two numbers that you cant visualize	Sometimes doing a common denominator helps you really visualize how much you might need to find ones that	4.0
You cant necessarily picture what 50 thousandths looks like so you put it in lowest terms it might actually be more meaningful and do that for other fractions	Yes	1.0
Read it with me please	How to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions	1.0

What is a factor	Factor pairs are like different numbers that go into a specific number like 36 in that case so that two numbers that make that a 36	5.0
Can you pick somebody that wants to add to it	I agree with your team	2.0
I agree with your team	What Id like to add on I also think its more than one number trying to make up another number like one certain number because 2x18 makes up 36 and thats their certain number and its as many numbers that makes up another number	5.0
What Id like to add on I also think its more than one number trying to make up another number like one certain number because 2x18 makes up 36 and thats their certain number and its as many numbers that makes up another number	Reading about it its numbers that are always going to make up another one	5.0

You want to add on to it Melody	Yes	1.0
Yes	Its similar	2.0
Its similar	I agree with yours and I also want to add on that three can go into nine so you dont have to find another multiple	5.0
I agree with yours and I also want to add on that three can go into nine so you dont have to find another multiple	Its like that	1.0
Its like that	One of the numbers can go into the other	5.0
One of the numbers can go into the other	You wouldnt have to multiply five ninths by anything because you can just do the twothirds multiply that by three then itll give you Both the denominators would be nine	5.0

If you did not get that you need to look back at your work and figure out why did you not get a 102	One hundred two	4.0
One hundred two isnt 15	Can I explain why	1.0
Kyan read the problem	Can I explain why	1.0
Can I explain why	Oh yes	1.0
You need to figure out why you didnt get 102	I did get 102	1.0
Grant	So first you wrote the numbers	5.0
So first you wrote the numbers	So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	5.0
So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	5.0
You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	Then you do 1800 divided by 100 which is 18 and then you do that minus or you do 120 minus 18 you get 102	5.0
So if Im thinking about this problem I know that 15 were late and its asking how many were on time 15 were late what percent were on time	His sneeze turned it off	1.0
If 15 were late what percent were on time	Eightyfive	4.0
Kyan where did you get 85	Because 100 minus 15	4.0
Youve got this problem	No	1.0
No	This is the total cars	4.0
This is the total cars	Yes	2.0
Yes	Twenty cars are not blue	4.0
Twenty cars are not blue	Number 15 Burger King  lettuce	1.0
Number 15 Burger King  lettuce	The last thing youd expect on your Burger King burger is somebody elses foot fungus	1.0
The last thing youd expect on your Burger King burger is somebody elses foot fungus	I got 25	4.0
Andrew what did you do	we did former X is equal to 16 over 100 then we did 16  X which is 16X and then 4 x 100 which is 400	5.0
we did former X is equal to 16 over 100 then we did 16  X which is 16X and then 4 x 100 which is 400	Then we divide both of them with 15 and got 25 then after that	5.0
What does 25 represent Andrew	It represents how many cars there are	4.0
Then what would you have to do	Youd have to subtract four and then get 21	4.0
Is it the part or the whole	I think its the part because like the whole is like how much you compare it for	5.0
Is working together	David what did you get	3.0
David what did you get	What did you get	3.0
So did you pay part of the total or the whole total	Part	4.0
Then did anyone simplify this first	Well I did a different one	4.0
Questions	Nope	1.0
You said a hundred I thought you said a hundred and eight	It swivels all the way around	1.0
It swivels all the way around	He just looks up	1.0
He just looks up	Why is it looking at me	1.0
Why is it looking at me	It found you	1.0
The answer is not	Its 16 minus 48	4.0
Its 16 minus 48	Its 1122	4.0
Its 1122	No its not	2.0
No its not	It is	2.0
It is	No	2.0
No	Its not 32 ounces	4.0
So your answer cannot be bigger than 16	I even made a couple of mistakes	4.0
How many ounces are taken up of that 16 with ice		4.0
What percent if 30 is ice what percent is juice	Seventy	4.0
That would tell you how much juice it is or you could have gotten the 48 and then what do you have to do with your 48	Subtract it	4.0
Is your answer before you start	Hes gained some weight	4.0
Is your answer going to be more or less than 90 pounds	Less	4.0
Figure it out with your partner	Im over here	1.0
Im over here	Hello	1.0
Hello	Hello	1.0

Hello	Hi there	1.0
Hi there	Hello	1.0
Hello	He would have weighed	1.0
He would have weighed	Im over here	1.0
Im over here	He weighed 75	4.0
He weighed 75	Yes	2.0
Yes	How can he weigh 75 pounds	3.0
How much did this sixthgrader weigh when he was in fourth grade	Seventyfive	4.0
Seventyfive what	Pounds	4.0
How many like to free draw	They are 25	4.0
How many like to do group activities	We dont know how	4.0
Do you see how he got that one Julian	No he	2.0
Tomas what are you doing	Helping John	1.0
The answer is not a hundred	I didnt say it was a hundred but we already have that one	4.0
How is it going to be 200  in our club of boys when theres  in our club	Because 50 is	4.0
You have this one  theyre both boys and how many boys are there	Im smarter than an eighthgrader	1.0
Whats this number	Ninety	4.0
What are the two different things	Free draw	4.0
Free draw	And group activities	4.0
How many kids is that	Ten	4.0
If we know 10 kids like to free draw how many like group activities	Ninety	4.0
Jane	You have to  find out the percentage of	4.0
What percentage of the people who like group activities are boys	Ninety or 50 I mean	4.0
How many boys are there in our club	Fortynine	4.0
Put one and two on your math paper and heres number one	One of two	1.0
Number one	My one is huge	1.0
How many bags will go in each trail mix	There are 27	1.0
There are 27	Theres 27	1.0
Theres 15 bags of MMs	I know	1.0

Make sure your names on them	Wheres the	1.0
If your white paper is  you may turn your tests over	Wait	1.0
Wait	Did you grade the	1.0
Did you grade the	Okay	1.0
If your white paper	Are we doing the next page	1.0
I cant hear what youre saying	Are we doing number three	1.0
Are we doing number three	I did B wrong too	4.0
I did B wrong too	I got B wrong too	2.0
I got B wrong too	I got three wrong because I subtracted instead of	5.0
I got three wrong because I subtracted instead of	I added	2.0
I added	I multiplied it	2.0
I multiplied it	I subtracted but I didnt get the right answer	2.0
I subtracted but I didnt get the right answer	Robert you failed	2.0
Robert you failed	I added it	2.0
I added it	She had to use red	1.0
She had to use red	Of all the color she had to  I hate red	1.0
This is to help us make sure that we understand these	But it wasnt just a pretest	1.0
We still havent learned all the concepts here on the fractions	So this is a midtest	1.0
So its a midtest to see	This is really tricky in the middle of four	1.0
Robert	So we took this before	1.0
will you raise your hand	We took this before winter break	1.0
Remember when Ms Holly was in here	Yes	1.0
Are you going to do subtraction addition division or multiplication and what words are possibly giving you the hint	Addition	4.0
Addition	You have to do addition	4.0
You have to do addition	Because it says how	1.0
Because it says how	how much  subtraction	4.0
how much  subtraction	Im going to put a plus sign above the points there on addition	4.0
Im going to put a plus sign above the points there on addition	I think we all did addition	2.0
I think we all did addition	That will be nice	1.0
That will be nice	Because it says like in all how much addition	4.0
Are we doing addition subtraction multiplication or division	Do subtraction	4.0
Whats this team thinking	Addition	4.0
Addition	Addition	4.0
Frankie	How much spinach does she need	4.0
Robert	I like subtraction	5.0
I like subtraction	How many more is on subtraction	5.0
How many more is on subtraction	So if I know that how many its subtraction then I know how much is probably addition	5.0
If we were to write a number sentence Sophie what if were trying to figure out how much what would we be adding	Three and threefourths	4.0
If you dont have that on yours underneath it write it	I have that	2.0
I have that	I do	2.0
Figure out how youre going to add these two together	First you do	1.0
First you do	Actually the big the whole  equal five	4.0
Actually the big the whole  equal five	Are we doing it	1.0
Are we doing it	You dont  but you dont the denominator	4.0
Whats your strategy	because thats why got it wrong because you dont	4.0
because thats why got it wrong because you dont	Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	4.0
Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	So I had fivetenths of it	2.0
What is your strategy	So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	4.0
So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	Not the denominator	2.0
Not the denominator	That s why she got it wrong	2.0
So here if I were to divide this can I put on top of my fraction circle can I put three or fours on top of can I put the thirds on top of the fours	Thats what I did	4.0
Its not going to be equal though	Its not going to be equal so you cant	5.0
Its not going to be equal so you cant	Unless	1.0
No	No	1.0
Does four go into six equally	No	1.0
Does three go into six equally	Yes	1.0
What about 10	No	1.0
For neither right	For neither	1.0
For neither	Okay	1.0
What about 12s	Yes	1.0
How many pieces of a 12	Five	4.0
Five	Six	2.0
Remember theyre the pink ones	Three of 12 would fit	4.0
This 34 is equivalent to 912	Yes	1.0
Yes	You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	5.0
You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	Yes because you did 34 x 3 then that equals 912	5.0
Piper	Four	4.0
Its 112 bigger than two thirds	A little bit	4.0
My denominator is going to be what	Twelve	4.0
So 8  9 is	Seventeen	4.0
From here to here	Okay	1.0
Okay	So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	5.0
So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	5.0
You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	Then it would also be a whole because you had to take for 12 and 12 is whole	5.0
What does this line mean Lydia	Is it dividing	4.0
So 12 into 17 if I divide this Im going to end up exactly with what Madelien said 12 goes into 17 how many times	One	4.0
Then I need to subtract 12 from the 17	Five	4.0
Yes I have 1 and 512 is that how much spinach	No	1.0
I have this  what else am I missing	I know	1.0
Allan get a wipe	I will	1.0
Take care of that	That is	1.0
Were giving Leonardo some think time	The numbers	4.0
Leonardo you need some help	I dont think	1.0
Think ask somebody to help you	You leave the five and then you do five plus the one equals six and then you just bring over 512	5.0
Julia did you get number four right	The first part yes	4.0
The first part yes	Second part	1.0
Were doing number four Anybody else get number four right	Yes	1.0
Yes	I got it right	4.0
I got it right	I just needed more	4.0
I just needed more	I got it right	4.0
Okay	Miss Carroll what if	1.0
Miss Carroll what if		1.0
	I got a bunch of work to do	1.0
I got a bunch of work to do	for my number four problem	1.0
Do you feel like you need to hear	No probably not	1.0
Do you have what you want from here	Ive got a bit of a problem	1.0
What	Its not in the computer	1.0
Its not in the computer	Theres none	1.0
So are we good here	No	1.0
No	I should keep this on my desk	1.0
Ash did you take notes	Yes	1.0
Do you have number three	I got number three done	1.0
Casey you do too	Yes	1.0
Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong without calculating the exact answer	Can I say mines funny too	1.0
Can I say mines funny too	Yes can I say mine	1.0
The what	It was by the elevator	1.0
Is that cart 9	It is	1.0
Bring it in Devin put it in front of the swivel	I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	5.0
I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	So his answer is wrong	5.0
So his answer is wrong	Thats why I said subtract or add	5.0
Thats why I said subtract or add	That way youre going to let me know	5.0
That way youre going to let me know	Okay	1.0
Okay	Add it	5.0
Add it	He subtracted it but he subtracted the denominator	5.0
You can work withEverete and Declan	I can just grab and stuff	1.0
I can just grab and stuff	I dont know what I was thinking	1.0
I dont know what I was thinking	What I wrote I didnt	1.0
So you make sure  so he can understand whats wrong with it	So Jamen the thing thats wrong with it is that we dont add or subtract the denominator	2.0
So Jamen the thing thats wrong with it is that we dont add or subtract the denominator	He added and subtracted the denominator	5.0
done with this up here	Yes  is mine wrong	4.0
Are you guys done with the board	Im a Barbie girl in a Barbie world	1.0
Is everybody at this table done with whats on the board	Im a Barbie boy in a Barbie	1.0
Casey are you done	No	1.0
Team three	So our explanation was I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	5.0
So our explanation was I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator	So his answer is wrong	5.0
You have something to add	Yes	1.0
Yes	When he says that the denominator youre not supposed to add or subtract the denominator the reason why is because well its asking Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong	5.0
When he says that the denominator youre not supposed to add or subtract the denominator the reason why is because well its asking Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong	Technically when it says he got the answer 1115 he added 20 and 5 or he subtracted 20 minus 5 which got him 15 and youre not supposed to subtract the denominator	5.0
Do you need your pencil sharpened	Yes	1.0
We are listening	15 minus 12 is going to give you  you have to	4.0
Hey this group here what did you guys say	We didnt quite have an answer yet were trying to figure it out	1.0
Dont start talking	1540	4.0
1540	Yes	1.0
Hey what about this table	We were	1.0
We were	I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator	5.0
I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator	You only subtract the numerator and we only do that if you have the same denominator	5.0
So kind of the same	Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know	2.0
Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know	I said I know he is wrong because hes  which makes no sense because you have to get the denominator the same at all times	5.0
Is it less than a half	Bigger than a half	4.0
1115 is bigger than a half	So its nowhere near the answer	4.0
I didnt say one thing about my denominators	But definitely wrong too	4.0
I know that this is wrong because of taking this number 1320 subtracting 25 my answer should be close to 0 my answer should be a little bigger than 0	But not as big as a half	4.0
I know you can do the computer	Do you want us to do it on the back	1.0
I want you to do it someplace near number four	back and like four	1.0
The difference would be greater	Ms Carroll  not on the board for number four	1.0
So with the denominator talking about the denominators if I were to give this I would give it a 25 where this would be more of a 35 answer	But technically most answers are correct	1.0
Next Wednesday just because of	Because I already corrected it because	1.0
Ethan are you done with the computer	No	1.0

Colin what do you remember about the strategies that we learned	Yes we learned was that we split in half the shape so subtract	4.0
Gianna	The first thing that we have to do was find  and then we can find what the progression is	4.0
Amy	I think I wasnt the only one there was	1.0
Abel in order to have a shape you have to do something what did you have to do	Like take the denominator and split it and the	4.0
I cant split something I dont have you guys are jumping ahead quite a bit yes	You need to label it	4.0
I cant label something I dont have	You have to split both  like this is like a part here and a part here	4.0
I dont have any parts of anything  youre on the right track of what we do but were all forgetting what we did first and emphasizing this because Im sorry to interrupt Rose Im emphasizing this because on your exit slip very few people even tried to use the strategy in the class Maddie	You have to draw a picture	4.0
We have a picture for this	Yes I found it its right next to Monica	1.0

Tell us what would the two represent	Hey I cant hear him because you are all talking	1.0
Or is two the people	Two the people	4.0
Whats the two represent	The object	4.0
Whats the three	The people	4.0
The three represents	Denominator	4.0
Okay so Maddie youre part of team what	Four	1.0
Lets start with James	Yesterday was understanding how to subtract and add different common denominators and fractions	4.0
Thank you for starting this would you call on someone else	Were trying to find common denominators	4.0
Quinn would you like to add	Were trying to get common denominators to solve unlike denominators because its kind of hard to solve with unlike denominators	4.0
What do you mean its kind of hard to solve unlike denominators tell us more	Because if you have 1238 you really dont know how to add 1338 because there are two unlike denominators	5.0
Go	Im going to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions	1.0
Raise your hand if youre partner B and what is our learning intention asking us to do today	Use fractions and multiples to add and subtract fractions to find common denominators	1.0
Emma will you tell us that what was the conversation you and your partner have	We said it will be to use factors and multiples to find common denominators for numbers that have uncommon denominators so you could add and subtract the fractions	4.0
I want to hear all of your voices again how will we know if we have it today	I will be successful when I can find a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	1.0
We can do 1	36	4.0
We can do 2 what	18	4.0
3	12	4.0
4	9	4.0
9 and	6 6	4.0
Those are all factors of 36	Miss I have a question	3.0
The numbers you multiply are what	Factors	4.0
Its actually called a product but we would say 20 is a multiple of 4 because 4 5 is	20	4.0
Will you tell me yours	I like to be in her class because she always helps you with what youre doing unless she knows that you can do the problem and that youre just asking for help so that you know that youre getting it right and stuff	1.0
Im hearing you say shes really good at giving you just the right push and knowing how hard to have you work and then helping you when you need it	Yes	1.0
Would you tell me your name	Carson	1.0
Carson would you share with your classmates whats something youve heard from someone else in your Mix and Mingle	From Jon he said that his favorite part of being in T2s class is T2	1.0
Ive already been in fifth grade	I heard from Olivia that she always helps him be able to learn and how she always knows what to do to get him to understand math stuff	1.0
Stay standing if youre at table five	I heard from Ava that she likes being in T2s class because  science	1.0
Do you have 1 and 36	Yes	1.0
2 and 18	No	1.0
3 and 12	Yes	1.0
Yes	No wait that was only	1.0
No wait that was only	We just have 2 and 18	1.0
4 and 9	Yes	1.0
And 6	Yes	1.0
Whats 8 1	8	4.0
Whats 8 2	16	4.0
Say that nice and loud	It can go on forever	4.0
What can go on forever	The multiples of 8 or 1	4.0
Quinn	Because 0 8 is always 0 and 1 8 is always whenever a number multiply one	5.0
Emma	Like she said theres no other number to multiply by	2.0
Like she said theres no other number to multiply by	Youre going to get smaller than 8	2.0
Is 1 a multiple of 8	No	1.0
Say that again	1 isnt a multiple of 8 its a factor	4.0
Hey speak up a little louder	No	1.0
No	1 cant be a multiple of 8 because its a factor	5.0
Would you call on someone Jon	I want to add to that and I agree with you because 1 is a factor	2.0
I want to add to that and I agree with you because 1 is a factor	Its not a multiple because a multiple is what she said its a number  8	2.0
Its not a multiple because a multiple is what she said its a number  8	2 816 but 1 88 so it is a factor	5.0
Ready	Yes	1.0
Yes my dear	6 and 2	4.0
Yes my dear	3 and 4	4.0
Are there more	Yes	1.0
Is there another one Zachary	4 3	4.0
Do we have anything else	1 12	4.0
Would you please write the first three multiples of 12	You mean 12	1.0
When you think about multiples of 12 were going to say 12 1 is	12	4.0
Whats 12 2	24	4.0
24	How many multiples	3.0
Friends Do you have carpet spots	Yes	1.0
Please meet me on the carpet	With our journal	1.0
Talk to us about how would you solve this with finding equivalent fractions so that they have common denominators	I start writing two fraction lists	4.0
Talk to us about what youre doing and why	Im starting 9 and then Im going up to 18 plus fraction	5.0
Hes listing the multiples of 9	Then 6 12 18 and then	4.0
He wrote out the multiples of 9 and Fletcher wrote the multiples of 6 and then what was your next step	I circled them to make sure that	4.0
How are you going to change those two fractions so that you can add them	Well	1.0
Well	You just double that and then triple that	5.0
You just double that and then triple that	You do this three times and do that two times	5.0
You agree fifthgraders agree disagree would you do it the same way	I dont know	1.0
Call on someone	I agree because your strategy its sufficient	2.0
I agree because your strategy its sufficient	It might be the same answer that the teacher is going to give	1.0
It might be the same answer that the teacher is going to give	I feel like its probably going to be a great answer	1.0
How do you know	Well because if you double the first one because theres two up there and triple that one	5.0
Well because if you double the first one because theres two up there and triple that one	You plus the one and plus the one and youll get your answer	5.0
Chloe	I agree because it took me two multiples of 9 to get to 18 and even it had 29 2 and then took me 3 to get to 18 multiple of 6 and then get 3 6	2.0
We need to erase it first go back to where you were	Or you can just click the side	1.0
Click the side Tim	Then click  then click the erase	1.0
Did the green light come on	Yes	1.0
You guys got yours on	Yes	1.0
You got yours on	Yes	1.0
You got yours on	Yes	1.0
Now say it loud	0586	4.0
Now let it out	39987	4.0
Antonio	I want to get better on it	4.0
Antonio	If you were doing a math problem youd want to know your answer is reasonable	4.0
What do you think of that thinking	Agreed	2.0
Read this aloud with me please	I can use area models to understand and apply an algorithm for fraction multiplication	1.0
What does that say Colt	A set of step by step instructions to doing something such as carrying out  into a solution or solving a problem	1.0
Can you read this for us please Lyla	I will know when I couldnt do it when I can just successfully use the algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two through seven on page 179	1.0
I will know when I couldnt do it when I can just successfully use the algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two through seven on page 179	Also I can explain how an area model shows one of my answers is correct	1.0
Zane how many parts	Two	4.0
Should you be doodling on your slate	No	1.0
Should you be talking with other people	No	1.0
Lets see whats on that page	We already did that	1.0
Lyla	The dimensions for the shaded rectangle should be 1 x 1	4.0
The dimensions for the shaded rectangle should be 1 x 1	Wait no	4.0
What are the dimensions of this rectangle	26 x 34	4.0
Hes saying it very uncertainly No why would you want to use the tick marks	So you dont have to count what the dimensions are you can just look where the shaded ends where to mark	4.0
See up here if you have those tick marks its really clear where to shade to isnt	Yes	1.0
Zane did you see the relevance of that	Yes	1.0
Does that make sense now	Yes	1.0
What were the tick marks labelled Harley	There were the Xaxis that were labeled 13	4.0
What would the would the one whole potentially be labeled	44	4.0
Haitus	There would be labeled 66	4.0
The whole axis	No the whole axis	1.0
The first tick mark would be	16 26 36 46 56 and 66 or one whole	5.0
I need you to speak up so we can actually hear you	My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is	5.0
My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is	Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24	5.0
Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24	This is  34 by 26 and that explains it	5.0
Elise what are you trying to say	Just a question to ask him	2.0
Just a question to ask him	What would be the width of the shade	3.0
What would be the width of the shade	The width of the shade would be I think 34	4.0
Would that change if you clip it	No	1.0
You said something that was a great modeling for other students because I see some people counting each of those squares theyve count all the squares but you did something can you explain that part again real quick for everybody that didnt catch it	to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four	5.0
to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four	you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent	5.0
Noelle	I think the algorithm is	1.0
Was it going to be an answer to a computation problem	No	1.0
No its not	Itll get you that	4.0
Whats the pattern that you see Gray	The pattern I see is that when you see the multiplication problem like 56 x 14 you tend to do the numerator time the numerator like 5 x 1 but then do the denominator times the denominator 6 x 4 and then when you multiply the numerators you got the numerator of your answer and when you multiply the denominator you got the denominator of your answer which was 524	5.0
Do they follow that rule	Yes	1.0
Does that rule work in each of those instances	Yes	1.0
Aspen	Denominator	4.0
Whats another word that youd like	Algorithm	4.0
Colt	Multiply	4.0
Aspen	Fraction	4.0
Everybody say it	Product	4.0
I feel like then you should say Then multiply the denominators or	the denominator	1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
Go ahead and read that for us Dakota	The algorithm for multiplying fractions and fractions is first to multiply the numerator of the two factors	4.0
The algorithm for multiplying fractions and fractions is first to multiply the numerator of the two factors	The answer to that will be the numerator of your product	4.0
The answer to that will be the numerator of your product	Next you multiply both denominators to get the next part of your product	4.0
Okay Cyrus	What I said is the algorithm of multiplying fractions is first you have to multiply both of the numerators to get the new numerator product then you have to multiply both denominators to get the new product then put both of the new products together	4.0
Are we still doing area models	No	1.0
1 x 3 is what	1 x 3 is 3	5.0
2 x 6 is what	2 x 6 is 2 I mean 12	5.0
thats why I got out templates	Yes	1.0
Is that helpful does that matter	Im confused	3.0
Dakota	My team was talking about you would take the denominator of your product and divide it by one of the denominators of the factors and then if you get the denominator of the other factor that you didnt divide your product denominator by you multiply the denominator and you would do the same thing for the numerators	5.0
Harley	If you were finding out half of 34 for example you would probably get  less than what youre finding of 34 and if you get something bigger your algorithm is not correct	5.0
Zane can you read it orthe success criteria  for us	I will know I can do it when I can successfully use an algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two to seven	1.0
Two through	two through seven on page 179	1.0
two through seven on page 179	Also I can explain how the area model shows one of my answers is correct	1.0
Youll get your game on it	G is E	4.0
G is E	Yes so then it goes G So it should be DCEA	2.0
Yes so then it goes G So it should be DCEA	Almost like what we talked about in the first place	1.0
10 seconds are left	Whats the frigging Oh my God	1.0
Whats the frigging Oh my God	Are you serious	1.0
Are you serious		1.0
	Yes it was	1.0
Yes it was	Okay so Im just going to say	1.0
Okay so Im just going to say	So its DCBADFE	4.0
So its DCBADFE	ATFE Mr	2.0
ATFE Mr	Genius you should know this	1.0
Dont forget that for this part you should be able to use your toolkit	Did you just  my seat down  leaning on it	1.0
Did you just  my seat down  leaning on it	Yes so you dont end up on my feet	1.0
Yes so you dont end up on my feet	Do you know how to do it	1.0
Do you know how to do it	Yes I do	1.0
Yes I do	How do you do it	1.0
How do you do it	That part you just get	1.0
That part you just get	That works	1.0
That works	But theyre just	1.0
But theyre just	That works too	1.0
Yes you dont have to solve it	Im still doing it because Im still	1.0
Its not a bad plan	You just subtract these	4.0
You just subtract these	Oh wait	1.0
Oh wait	You guys multiplied the fraction	2.0
You guys multiplied the fraction	Oh because you subtract this	4.0
Oh because you subtract this	Yes you subtract this	2.0
Yes you subtract this	Five to the power of eight	4.0
Five to the power of eight	Its 731	4.0
Its 731	You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	5.0
You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	No wait	1.0
No wait	You can actually solve for that	4.0
You can actually solve for that	You could	2.0
You could	So its actually 427	4.0
So its actually 427	125 to the power of 23	4.0
Yes you were supposed to be the genius	Come on	1.0
Come on	So its eight to the power of two	4.0
So its eight to the power of two	Its eight to the power of two 64	5.0
Its eight to the power of two 64	Thats probably wrong	2.0
So how can I use maybe this portion	I got mostly the right answers	1.0
Anything to the zero power is what	Zero	4.0
No	Oh one	4.0
is the answer to that one	Okay so how do we do exploration 3A	3.0
Okay so how do we do exploration 3A	Did you really	1.0
Did you really	Yes Im a genius	1.0
If were starting right now with what was it 98 or 96		4.0
How can I rewrite it using this property	The brilliance at this table is impeccable	1.0
Yes I think we will	That was the longest five minutes	1.0
Do these make sense to you now	Yes	1.0
There was a desire to break to the commons	Yes	1.0
10 minutes be at the double doors	Im getting apple juice	1.0
How are you doing today	good	1.0
Good	And you	1.0
Brothers sisters	A sister	1.0
Your house	yes	1.0
All right were going to be on page 201	Journal or	1.0
All right lets get those phones put away gentlemen	Yes maam	1.0
Yes maam	Oh in here	1.0
Oh in here	What page	1.0
What page		1.0
	Were on 201	1.0
What would 23 be	Eight	4.0
33		4.0
43	No 64	4.0
No 64	Its 64	2.0
Its 64	Hold up let me check this	1.0
Four times four you have		4.0
Perfect cube	Did we get  48	4.0
Did we get  48	I think so but I dont know	2.0
Whats 53		4.0
That was a little bit easier	Whats the square root	3.0
In your toolkit were going to add these perfect cubes	All right the math checks out	4.0
All right the math checks out	Yes thats what Ive been saying	2.0
Yes thats what Ive been saying	Only intelligent	1.0
When we look at 135 what do we know is a factor	Five	4.0
When do they go from this to this whats happening	Magic	1.0
Now if I multiply by one am I changing my number	Not necessarily  its getting more specific in terms of	1.0
If I take seven and multiply it times one its still seven right	Yes	1.0
Is it still seven	Yes	1.0
Yes so why are we finding some sort of one to multiply our problem by	To remove the radical from the denominators	4.0
If we focus on what was chosen to multiply this by 8 is 2x2x2 right	Yes	1.0
What kind of root are we taking here	A fifth	4.0
Now the cube root of four	The cube root of four	1.0
What did they end up choosing is going to be the form that we have there	Oh this is  says Its conjugate	1.0
It is conjugates but if I have two things Im multiplying two binomials that Im multiplying one as a plus and one as a minus	Difference of two squares	4.0
Because what happens when we take the square root of three times the square root of three	Three	4.0
Were going to use the difference of two squares as the idea and as Santiago was saying we talk about it being a conjugate	Conjugation	1.0
Notice in this case that my index is the same and my radicand is the same so what did they do here	Three	4.0
Where did that one come from	Its an implied  factoring out a common	4.0
Its an implied  factoring out a common	I think	1.0
Whats a factor of 54	Two	4.0
Twentyseven so its two Oh thats a	Perfect cube	4.0
Now that Ive written things as cubes I can split them up if it helps to think of them that way and we know that if I have a cube root of something thats cubed	It cancels out	4.0
Then the question is why did they put an absolute value thing in there	Its not based on the principal root	4.0
Whats a number that I can take the fourth root of	They can be negative and positive	4.0
Yes if I say I take the fourth root of whats 2x2x2x2	Then you can have minus two and thats	4.0
Then you can have minus two and thats	Plus or minus	4.0
Explain what youre talking about Santiago	For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	5.0
For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	Yes am I not explaining enough	1.0
Yes am I not explaining enough	For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	5.0
For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	When we are typically working with radicals we want to get the principal root which is the positive answer and the absolute bar value is there to strictly involve with principal root	5.0
Example number seven	Oh my God	1.0
Oh my God	What	1.0
When we get out here pretty soon right 48	Yes	1.0
Ready go	An improper number one for half I got 36	4.0
An improper number one for half I got 36	I have 3 56 and then four is going to be 23	2.0
I have 3 56 and then four is going to be 23	For two thirds I got four eighths	2.0
For two thirds I got four eighths	No I disagree because two times six	2.0
No I disagree because two times six	six it looks	2.0
six it looks	Because three times two is six	5.0
Because three times two is six	Sorry	1.0
Sorry	68 is technically 34 and I rounded that up to a whole because I said a whole minus a half equals a half	5.0
68 is technically 34 and I rounded that up to a whole because I said a whole minus a half equals a half	I agree with	2.0
I agree with	I convert the 12 to 48 and did it and that would be 28	5.0
I convert the 12 to 48 and did it and that would be 28	Either way its halfway between half of them	5.0
Either way its halfway between half of them	3 x 3 is nine	5.0
3 x 3 is nine	3 x 3  9 thats right	2.0
3 x 4  12	Yes 912	4.0
Yes 912	I see what I did there	1.0
I see what I did there	Whatd you get	3.0
Whatd you get		4.0
	About 15	2.0
About 15	I didnt get anywhere for number two	1.0
I didnt get anywhere for number two	Wait what did you guys say for the last one	3.0
Wait what did you guys say for the last one	15 20 and	4.0
I know that 68 is over a half and so a little more than a half take away a half is going to be a little more than zero	Yes	1.0
I wouldnt expect a number with a five is what Im saying	No I was writing something better than	1.0
He said one thing and it says  I noticed	Page 27 83 and 72	1.0
Here	Yes	1.0
Theres your book	Common multiples a common multiple is a number is common multiple of two or more numbers if it is a multiple of each of those numbers	4.0
Why are these bold	Because those are all the common multiples of that	5.0
What does that mean	It is a multiple of each of those numbers because theyre both common and theyre both in the two Theres two of the same numbers in	5.0
Not just same numbers what kind of numbers	6  6 is 12	5.0
6  6 is 12	Thats common	4.0
Thats common	Here its common because	4.0
Can you say that	Multiple	1.0
Isnt 12 a common multiple of four and 12 also	Yes and then	1.0
Does that make sense	Yes examples	5.0
Yes examples	Three and five are factors of 15	4.0
Three and five are factors of 15	15 is the product of three and five	5.0
15 is the product of three and five	Three and five are a factor pair for 15	5.0
Three and five are a factor pair for 15	Counting numbers cant have more than one factor pair	5.0
Counting numbers cant have more than one factor pair	One and 15 are another factor pair of 15 because 1 x 15  15	5.0
One and 15 are another factor pair of 15 because 1 x 15  15	To test whether it	1.0
Does that all make sense to you	Yes	1.0
Why are three and five factors of 15	Because five times one equals 3 x 5  15 because five times three Five 10 15	5.0
Because five times one equals 3 x 5  15 because five times three Five 10 15	To test whether a counting number	4.0
To test whether a counting number	If you flip it around then five times three	4.0
Another factor pair one and 15 also	Three times No three is a factor of 15 because three can go into 15	5.0
Evenly	Yes evenly	1.0
Good	Then five can go into 15 evenly	4.0
Im curious	These are the factors	4.0
All the factors of		4.0
I wouldve just started with It says the first six doesnt	No it says all the factors	4.0
Two	Three four	1.0
I wouldve put them probably in order is my point	Were doing them backwards	4.0
Six is seven isnt	Eight is it	4.0
You guys are done	Yes	1.0
Try some different once	Weve done one and two	1.0
Weve done one and two	Try	1.0
Youre trying to decide if three is a factor of 36	I know	1.0
I know	Right now Im saying yes because theres 30 and six divided by three is	5.0
Right now Im saying yes because theres 30 and six divided by three is	Two	2.0
Two	Yes and because three goes into 36	2.0
Yes and because three goes into 36	Im smart	1.0
Im smart	Then you just go in	1.0
Yes because you know that three goes into 30 10 times	13	4.0
Three goes into six twice	Three and 13	4.0
Three and 13	What about four	3.0
Four times what equals 36	Four times eight	4.0
Four times eight	Close	2.0
Close	Thats 32	4.0
Thats 32	I meant nine	2.0
Four What times 10 is what		4.0
Take four away	Five will get you two	4.0
Five will get you two	Six	2.0
Six	What about seven	3.0
Does five go in	No	1.0
What about your four	What about seven	3.0
What about seven	Try seven	1.0
Try seven	No seven is not a factor	4.0
Six	What about eight	3.0
Six times what is 36	Six times six	4.0
You know six is going on	Now youre going to do youre going to write one	1.0
Youre at the oneminute warning	Okay	1.0
Good job	things that make up that number like a factor of five is obviously one because one is a factor of absolutely every single number	5.0
Multiply together to make five	You cant multiply three to make it a five	4.0
Adam	Its like adding it up 5  5  10 and 10  5 is 15	5.0
Say it again maybe I misheard it please	Its like 5  5 is 10 where you just keep adding five	5.0
Say what Adam described in your hands say it out loud	Repeated addition	4.0
Repeated addition	Multiples	2.0
Say it again louder	Multiples	4.0
Multiples everybody say that multiples	Multiples	1.0
Noah	A factor its not really a full multiplication problem its not like 2 x 2  4 that might be your target number or whatever the factor because youre trying to find all the factors for 36 to get to 36 so 2 x 18 thats a factor pair but if you have both of those numbers you want to take away one of those and just use one the numbers	5.0
Then when you have both of them its a pair	Its a factor pair	4.0
Do you want to add to that	Its like the addend of multiplication	2.0
Im trying to process what youre saying say that again	Its like an addend of multiplication the factor	2.0
Pick somebody thats doing this to respond to you	Amber	1.0
Amber	I see how you think its an addend but I really think its more of a number that is multiplied by another number to get the whole Like a target number but the number youre trying to get to like 36 like Noah was saying 18 is a factor because it can be multiplied by another number to get the whole number	5.0
Is one a factor of every number	Yes	1.0
Go	36 has even numbers in it and 2 is an even number	4.0
Brodie R	Two is a factor of 36 because 36 is an even number and you can split it into two numbers equally	5.0
Falicia	It kind of goes with that but its like a factor of every even number	4.0
What makes 3 a factor of 36 but not 37	Because 3 x 2 would be 6 but not 7	5.0
Falicia	Because you could split it equally into three groups	5.0
You can split what into three groups equally		4.0
Whats another way to prove that Margo	Another way to prove it is that I know that 3 x 11 is 33 and if you add another group of 3 it would be 3 x 12 which would be 36	5.0
Whats another way to prove that Jackson	Because 36 its an even and an odd number and three is an odd number so 3 can go into 36 12 times	5.0
Explain how 36 can be an even and an odd number	Because 36 is an even number because 2 can go into 36	5.0
Missy had an interesting way of knowing that 3 is a factor of 36 Ema	I said 3 is a factor 36 because if you take 3 x 2 it would be 6	5.0
I said 3 is a factor 36 because if you take 3 x 2 it would be 6	It wouldnt be a factor of 37 because 3 x 2 wouldnt be 7	5.0
You didnt explain the first part of how you knew that three was part of 36	Also three is a digit in 36	4.0
Shelby	I see where youre going with this	2.0
I see where youre going with this	I agree with the 3 x 2  6 and I think with the three is a digit I feel like youre trying to say that 3 x 10 would equal 30 and then you can take the 10 and the 2 and that would equal 12	5.0
Is that what youre saying	Yes	1.0
Kind of like partial products	Yes	1.0
Read this with me	I will use factors and multiples and common denominators to add and subtract fractions	1.0
Is four a factor of two	Yes	1.0
Or is two a factor in four	Yes	1.0
Is two a factor of six	Yes	1.0
Whatever youre multiplying by its going to be a factor right	Yes	1.0
Martha	You can use factors to help you find a common denominator because say you had a fraction problem like 16  18 and you would need to find a common denominator	5.0
What is a number that has the factors of 6 and 8	Then you could find the least common multiple	4.0
Least common	Least common factor or multiple	4.0
Read this with me	I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	1.0
Go	I see that maybe its like For one its connecting over 36 thats probably saying that 1 x 36 would equal 36	5.0
I see that maybe its like For one its connecting over 36 thats probably saying that 1 x 36 would equal 36	The 2 times the 18 36 yada yada so on so on	5.0
The 2 times the 18 36 yada yada so on so on	6 x 6 4 x 9 3 x 12	5.0
6 x 6 4 x 9 3 x 12	Like this except without the rainbows	5.0
Like this except without the rainbows	I am just now getting the rainbow part	2.0
That connects to make a pair	Im just not seeing that	1.0
Yes	For this see how it says multiples for 20 maybe its saying that if you count by five till you get to 20 and you count by four till you get to 20 the multiple of each of them	5.0
Are they factors	Five	4.0
Multiples is it a closed set	No	1.0
Lets start at the beginning and count	1 x 12	4.0
Is 2 a factor of 12	Yes	1.0
Yes because 2 x 6	Six yes	4.0
Then 3	Yes	1.0
3 x 4	Four yes	4.0
Four yes	Three	4.0
Weve just said 3 x 4	Then 5 no	4.0
No	6	4.0
Yes because 6 x 2	Two yes	4.0
Two yes	Then seven no	4.0
Then seven no	Eight no	4.0
Eight no	Nine no	4.0
Nine no	Ten no	4.0
Ten no	Eleven no	4.0
Eleven no	Twelve yes	4.0
How you connect it together so that you know that you have both numbers in the pair	Im going to rewrite these numbers	1.0
What is one times what	One times	1.0
Anything times one is the number itself so what matches up		4.0
Two does two going to go in 12	Yes	1.0
Two times	Six	4.0
What about three	Three should be like 3 x 6	4.0
No three times	Two	4.0
Does five go into 12	No	1.0
Thats right 36	That makes sense now	1.0
That makes sense now	36 and then	1.0

Grayson what do you think	Actually I said I agree with Maya	2.0
Ruby what did you say	I say that it moves far to the right all the way to 104 and 100 because zero times two first of all is zero but five times two which is the second coordinate on the xaxis five times two is 10	5.0
I say that it moves far to the right all the way to 104 and 100 because zero times two first of all is zero but five times two which is the second coordinate on the xaxis five times two is 10	Well move farther to the right	5.0

Like if you get a burger and McDonalds they say Double the size	Like Double the meat like usually that means bigger	5.0
Like Double the meat like usually that means bigger	So when it says double the first coordinate of all the points usually double means make it bigger	5.0
Okay and do you think its going to get bigger this way or this way or both	Wider	4.0
Okay	I said I think her new trapezoid	4.0
Excuse me	will get more wider	5.0
will get more wider	I think this because Amy created a rule that should make it wider	5.0
I think this because Amy created a rule that should make it wider	So she was the one that made a rule that should make her trapezoid bigger in width because she said she doesnt want it taller	5.0
So she was the one that made a rule that should make her trapezoid bigger in width because she said she doesnt want it taller	She wants it bigger and she created a rule that should make it wider	5.0
Okay Willow	I wrote The trapezoid will be wider	5.0
I wrote The trapezoid will be wider	She said she didnt want it to be taller	5.0
She said she didnt want it to be taller	So it would have to be wider	5.0

How did we describe whats happening right here	After 1X	4.0
What happens if its an even number	It bounces off	4.0
Now whats the simple solution	Plotting points	4.0
What tells us what end behavior is	If its going up and down	4.0
What would I look at in this to tell me about my end behavior	If the X value is positive	4.0
Tell me how I figure out that the X value is positive	The leading coefficient	4.0
Andy whats the positive leading coefficient tell me	Onesixth	4.0
What does that tell me	It tells you that its going to be straight on the vertical	4.0
At the ends you think	infinity	1.0
As X goes towards infinity whats happening to Y	You cant really go towards a number that doesnt exist because its	4.0
Because its just a little bit bigger and just a little bigger and just a little bigger	Youre not getting any closer to it though	4.0
Youre not getting any closer to it though	Youre still going for towards it	4.0
It does tell you about direction	It goes infinitely	4.0
What would the next statement then be Ethan	As X goes towards negative	4.0
As X goes towards negative	Why dont you just say as X decreases Y increases	2.0
Why dont you just say as X decreases Y increases	Thats a specific format for end behavior	2.0
Go ahead and decide who starts this is important	Im really sorry for being annoying	1.0
All right ladies and gentlemen any questions on these	Is there any way you can	1.0
Todd	I think it would be a silly mistake	4.0
Daria	I dont know	1.0
I dont know	Im	1.0
Im	If one denominator is a multiple of the other	1.0
If one denominator is a multiple of the other	If it is it is also a common denominator	1.0
Okay Im going to have you use this because Im seating two feet from you and I cannot hear you	Making a list of improper fractions	1.0
Were on the third one	Multiply by two or  product as a common denominator	1.0
Joey	My partner said Well we both said pretty much the same thing	2.0
My partner said Well we both said pretty much the same thing	and then you add it to the numerator	4.0
Luis what was your estimate and how did you find it	Half	4.0
Lets speak in a complete sentence My estimate was	My estimate was half because	4.0
How did you solve that mentally like that	I did	1.0
If you find the answer first and then estimate are you really estimating	No	1.0
Bailey	I know that	1.0
Okay and then what did you do to get your answer of half	I know that to get to half	1.0
The estimate of a half	I know two	4.0
Peyton share your thinking	I got one because	4.0
What did I say you could not do	Add them	4.0
If you didnt add them first how would you know that the answer is going to be close to one	Because they all have the same denominator and	5.0
Share your thinking Cooper	I agree but not really because you didnt really explain	2.0
How did you get the estimate of one	I looked at the denominator and	4.0
Cooper	The numerator	4.0
Brett can you explain how you got your answer its okay just explain	I got eight ninths	5.0
I got eight ninths	I got eight ninths because firstly I did all the numerators so 4  3  7 and 7  1  8	5.0
I got eight ninths because firstly I did all the numerators so 4  3  7 and 7  1  8	Then the denominator stays the same so the eight ninths	5.0
I have eight slices do I have almost a whole pizza	No	1.0
Maya share your thinking	You can add the second problem in your head and not the first one because the second problem had the same denominators so you could just add it but the first problem had unlike denominators so you have to go through the whole process to get a common denominator	5.0
Anna what did you notice about that problem	The denominators is	4.0
sit down listen	and whoever added this and the denominator is	5.0
Okay and is that wrong or right class	Wrong	2.0
Remy	Im thinking that actually out the	1.0
Right and remember if a complete sentence we say its	Because	1.0
Because so can you rephrase that	Yes	1.0
What do the denominators do class	Stay the same	4.0
Cooper can you read that second question starting with the word how	How would estimation help the person to solve this problem	1.0
Okay Red Robin	No	1.0
How would estimation help	Estimation would help to see if your estimation is closer to your answer	4.0
Bailey	That person can see if they did it wrong	4.0
Let s think what is one 13 closest to boys and girls zero half or one	Zero	4.0
Zero	Half	2.0
Bailey would you like to keep going	Yes	1.0
Would this answer be bigger than one	Yes	1.0
Yes because 56 is almost a whole and then you guys just told me that 13 is closer to a half so thats going to push it over and be bigger than one is that answer bigger than one	No	1.0
Okay heres the deal when we did this how many multiples did we typically find	Five	4.0
Reese can you please read step three	Find the equivalent fraction using the lowest common multiple	4.0
But what did I multiply that by	You do both fractions	4.0
Do you remember what did we do Madison	We had a box	4.0
Okay where did 66 come from	I dont know	4.0
Whats the denominator of that fraction	Six	4.0
Do I need to do anything to it	No	1.0
Our problem was 56 right	Yes	1.0
Our new was 26 right	Yes	1.0
Class what do I write	56	4.0
Now I add whats two plus five	Seven	1.0
We originally said this was 76 right	Yes	1.0
Julia why eight and 16 instead of one and 16	Since the top one is bigger than the bottom you add the seven plus another one	5.0
You guys already showed and talked	Yes	1.0
What number are you guys on	Eight	1.0
Is this the right one	Yes	1.0
Youre sure	Yes	1.0
Todd	You can help him	1.0
Make sense	No	1.0
Yesterday 15 of the 126 graders were late	What the heck	1.0
What the heck	What am I doing wrong	3.0
What am I doing wrong	But its a percent	4.0
But its a percent	It cant be	2.0
Its not the thing that I put on here to make the heater turn on	No	1.0
No	To make the what turn on	1.0
Lynda	What I did is I had X over 120 equals 15 over 100	4.0
How did you know	I knew that because it says of the 120 and of goes	4.0
15 is not is it was of its down there so then whatd you do	After that I multiplied 120 by 15 which is 1800 and then I did 120 times X which is 100X	5.0
Well this is 1800	Yes and then I divided 100 by 100 to give X by itself and I did the same on the other side and then I got 18	5.0
Lynda pick someone to answer that question	Miriam	1.0
Miriam	18 is the amount ofSSthat were late	4.0
Lynda what did you have to do to figure out because the question says how many were on time	What I did is I subtracted 18 by 120	4.0
You subtracted 118 by 18 From	From yes	1.0
120 and you got		4.0
Knowing that could you have put a different number in your proportion	Yes	1.0
If I put Lets say that I said 85 of the kids were on time and without simplifying out these two you have 100x equals Somebody do 120 times 85		4.0
No 85 times 120	One zero two zero zero	4.0
One zero two zero zero	Yes 10200	2.0
Divide 10200 by 100		4.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Zara what did you do	Me and Lane first we did simplify the  16X equals 100	4.0
Hold on so you had to do In your proportion where does the four go	On top	4.0
If you looks at this four cars is 16 so how many cars is 100		4.0
Zara what does that mean	It means that theres 25 cars in the parking lot	4.0
Four of them are blue so Zara how many of them are not blue		4.0
Guys if you went to Target and you bought the stuff and it was not on sale would you pay more or less than 116	More	1.0
This 116 is this the whole amount or part of the amount	Part	4.0
If it did ask how much you saved how much did you save Spencer		4.0
Is that 16 ounces the whole glass or part of the glass	Whole	4.0
We also know that 30 is what	Ice	4.0
What does that 30 represent	Ice	4.0
Is your answer juice	No	1.0
What is that 48 ounces of Travis	Ice	4.0
If its 30 ice what percent does it have juice		4.0
Okay Adrianna	Analyze these numbers 7568 and 955	1.0
Analyze these numbers 7568 and 955	Write a number that has a nine and that is onetenth the value of the nine in the number and eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	1.0
Byron	Analyze	4.0
Whats another one  Byron	Write	4.0
Allison	Prove	4.0
You want to analyze it and analyze means what	Focus on it and look closely	4.0
All right so lets look at this so we can all see this together	Ms  does this	1.0
Frankie what did your team say needs to happen to the eight	They said it needs to be switched around to the ninth place	4.0
They said it needs to be switched around to the ninth place	But they said they need to be switched around	4.0
Eight and nine need to be switched	Yes	1.0
Did your team say why they think that	No	1.0
Collin what did your team say	They said that youre supposed to switch the nine and the eight so the ninth to the 10th space then  by one	5.0
Are they saying to keep it in the tenth place	No	1.0
Okay so you think Which five the first five or the second five	The ninth	4.0
Andrea	The eight needs to go to where the six is	4.0
The eight needs to go to where the six is	Because	1.0
I need to know why its going there Jared	Because when they said eight has to go ten times the value of where the eight is so it would be going up a place	5.0
Adrianna what do you want to add on	It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	5.0
It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	That means you would have to do 8 x 10 so that would be 80 and 80 would be in the tenth place	5.0
Damien	It says Write a number that has nine and that 110 is not a full number so youre not going forward you have to go backwards	5.0
If you multiply a whole number by a fraction	Its going to be	1.0
Its going to be what	Its going to be a hundredths	4.0
3281595 does that number fit the rule	Where does three come from	3.0
You could have switched numbers that would have been fine too just like whoever told me to put Was it Catalina	Yes	1.0
Heres what I would say in a problem like this even if you had multiple nines as long as you have a nine in the hundredth  as your Ms Carroll I dont know if that tells me that you fully understand	Well except theres an eight	4.0
Well except theres an eight	It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	2.0
It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	Nine	4.0
Nine	Nine nine nine eight eight eight	1.0
Allison lets hear yours	My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	5.0
My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	Then if you switch the eight with the six in 7568 that is how I got 7586595	5.0
I understand that she gets it but she didnt say why	If she would have said The reason I put it there was because it said that it should be 10 times more so 8 x 10 is 80 which would make it get put in that place	5.0
Adrianna lets hear yours	You want me to do the answers first	1.0
I want you to read your explanation	I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	5.0
I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	What I did with the nine is I made it go to the 100th place because it says nine  is 110 the value so I would make the nine go in the one hundredth	5.0
I dont know she might have	I dont get Never mind	1.0
I got the final answer of 3281595	Thats because there was another 10	5.0
Adrianna	If I multiplied 10 by eight would that be sort of three I guess	5.0
Yes I think the only thing you were missing did you restate	No of course I didnt	1.0
Then did you use transition words	Probably not	1.0
Probably not	I used transition words	1.0
So write a number	Do you want us to explain it to	1.0
Whats that all about	Factoring	4.0
If we look at dividing 125 by 25 how many times does it go in	Five	4.0
Whereas if I take 125 and I divide it by 20 how many times does it go in there	625	4.0
Remember this is an X K format so my K value is	Two	4.0
Is it a factor	No	1.0
Now if I do this synthetic division Im looking over here so my remainder is	Zero	1.0
Is X5 a factor	Why do we synthetic division	3.0
Why do we synthetic division	Is it just another way to do it	4.0
Is it just another way to do it	We couldve plugged in 5	4.0
Yes Zach	How do you feel like X	3.0
Step number one person number one at the table remind your team whats step number one here	You bring down the 1	4.0
Im going to do AB	For the 6X	4.0
Then Im going to square the A value multiply the A and B together times 5 and then Im going to square then new X factor	6218 thats plus two right	4.0
Can you guys come quick	No	1.0
Did you keep it	You just keep it	1.0
You just keep it	You split the middle	1.0
With long division we subtract with synthetic division we add	Yes thats how I do it	4.0
Did that help	Can you hear me now	1.0
You need to come and explain to her how I got the mean here	Wait how does 18X turn to X3	3.0
I multiplied 8  C	Just 8 not the 96	4.0
Great	How do you factor	3.0
Heres where it going to be helpful to do an intermediate  with what is it thats actually cubed plus what is it thats actually  Now I know what the A and the B are in that little part of the formula	So we have five minutes	1.0
And that would be	1 and 2	4.0
One two three	Three	4.0
The leading coefficient	One	4.0
Is two a factor	Yes	1.0
How about three	No	1.0

How many different factors do we have		4.0
I come up with my final solution set	try numbers or is it specific numbers you try	4.0
This tells me the next factor that goes with it	Theoretically	1.0
Probably not 12 because how many numbers would have worked	Three	4.0
So how are we going to	I never signed the form you can use this audio	1.0

We did a little bit of the footwork together	Is this  to those who get done	1.0
Well that should have already been done	I know Im getting it done but it takes forever	1.0
I know Im getting it done but it takes forever	because youre the smart one	1.0
because youre the smart one	Thats the only problem	1.0
Evelyn has a question	If you want the answer in simplest form or	3.0
All right it will be 13 minutes	You wont be mad if we just try	1.0
Some of you are still working on it	I just want to	1.0
Okay you give that to me	Im almost done explaining	1.0
Did anybody when they did this did they write the number of sentence	Yes	1.0
Raise your hand if you wrote a number or sentence	I think I did	1.0
Did anybody draw a picture	Yes	1.0
Amelia	Yes	1.0
Did you use another strategy	Yes	1.0
Dont explain everything you did just tell us the strategy	I did several number sentences and I drew a picture of some circles	5.0
I did several number sentences and I drew a picture of some circles	I equally split them and I said what the first answer I got and then I used the picture to help me and I got my final answer	5.0
Show me	I used the division thing that I	4.0
Is it partial quotients	I think it was traditional division	4.0
I think it was traditional division	I just knew the answer	1.0
Thumb up in the middle thumbs down	I was in between in the middle and thumbs up	1.0
Okay	I feel great	1.0
I feel great	In between good and in between the middle	1.0
Okay well Im excited to see your explanations to see if theyre better from last time	Or worse	1.0
No I hope theyre not worse	What we are doing the beginning of the year middle	1.0

Come on	Four  and five sandwiches and four	4.0
Four  and five sandwiches and four	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes four	4.0
Yes four	what theyre splitting five sandwiches	4.0
what theyre splitting five sandwiches	Because thats what theyre sharing	4.0
I like what Jessie did because when we make our number sentence thinking back to the order of division knowing what it is youre splitting is so important to put that number sentence in the right order	So  actually gave me this idea	4.0
So  actually gave me this idea	I did the question because thats how you know what youre going to be dividing and also so you know what youre actually dividing	1.0
I did the question because thats how you know what youre going to be dividing and also so you know what youre actually dividing	That was to start off	4.0
I will need you right now to have your whiteboard and marker and the other thing that you will need today do you have a math spiral	Yes	1.0
Thats exciting isnt it	Yes	1.0
Go	Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	1.0
Bobby are you willing to	Yes	1.0
Tell us	It is saying you find denominators and multiply them but we are not multiplying the denominator but multiplying fractions	4.0
Is denominator top number or bottom number	Bottom	4.0
Say it	Numerator	4.0
Go	I know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	1.0
Will you share your thinking that I heard you talk about	I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	5.0
I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	If youre adding on another eighths that would be five eighths and one and five eighths is really close to four eighths and its one eighth away from a half and its three eighths away from the whole	5.0
Will you remind me your name please	Im Jenny	1.0
Jenny	I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	5.0
I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	Since youre adding to one half you would round this up to one whole	5.0
Jenny will you call on someone else to add on to what you were thinking	Virginia	1.0
Virginia	I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	3.0
I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	5.0
You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	So youre having to round it up to one whole	5.0
So youre having to round it up to one whole	Youre going to round it back onto one half because of the middle more	5.0
Julie	We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	5.0
We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	So if you are rounding it it would almost be a whole minus a whole which we thought would be whole zero	5.0
Thank you	I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	5.0
I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	When you have one tenth it would be just a little less than one hundredth than one	5.0
Eliza would you call on someone else to share their thinking	Julie	1.0
Julie	I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	3.0
I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	5.0
Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	Thats over a whole which we decided will be closer to a whole	5.0
Can you check for me	Back	1.0
Is that better	Yes	1.0
All four of the fourths	What color	1.0
Theyre yellow	Yellow fourths	1.0
Tell us about your thinking Robin	First I split the circle into fifths and then I shaded in pink the three fifths and then I shaded it orange the one fifth too	5.0
Thank you	Then I did an orange of one fifth so you could see thats two different numbers	5.0
So you shaded in three of them and then one of them and your total is	Four fifths	4.0
Go	So what I did is I took one half and  a fourth  so then I drew it and I came up  and then I connected another one	5.0
How many fourths make up a half	Two	4.0
Can I have you guys please turn your eyes and ears this way over to Noah	I did a number line strategy and	4.0
There we go	What I did I did two number lines	5.0
What I did I did two number lines	One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	5.0
One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer	5.0
He said he converted one half to	Three fourths	4.0
So that it is	An equivalent fraction	4.0
Say Equivalent fraction	Equivalent fraction	1.0
How do you know one half	If you have a number line youd see two fourths sits directly underneath one half so thats why you have an equal	5.0
that	like to add	1.0
like to add	add the root of the equivalent is equal	4.0
add the root of the equivalent is equal	So thats not	1.0
Whats your math reasoning	Fraction pieces	4.0
did you want to add on	Oh I couldnt	1.0
Go	You said	1.0
So 14 and 13 is looks like this	Yes thats	1.0
Yes thats	I knew	1.0
My friends would you please turn your chairs turn your body so that you can see the front screen	What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	5.0
What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	So I added 14 and 13	5.0
So I added 14 and 13	So 14 is equivalent to 312 and because it was equivalent to 312 and then 13 was equivalent to 412 I did 312 plus 412 is 712	5.0
If you were looking at the actual color fraction pieces these would be the colors and the pieces you would use 14 is the equivalent to one yellow piece 14 is equivalent to	312	4.0
Three green pieces 13 one orange piece is equivalent to	412	4.0
We are starting with 14 plus 13 is that right Julie	Mmhmm	1.0
Mmhmm	A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	5.0
A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	5.0
So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	5.0
It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	5.0
So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	So I did the same thing	5.0
So I did the same thing	You have to do the same thing	5.0
You have to do the same thing	1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	5.0
1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	So now it will be 412  312	5.0
So now it will be 412  312	Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	5.0
Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	So four plus three would be seven	5.0
So four plus three would be seven	That will be 712	5.0
Youre using the multiplication strategy to help you get common denominators	Uhhuh	1.0
The multiplication strategy gets you two equivalent fractions so that then you can add the numerators	Yes	1.0
Yes	For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	4.0
For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	Thats what it is like	1.0
Thats what it is like	So thats what I did to	1.0
So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator	Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator	5.0
So if I multiply the denominator by the other denominator and then whatever you multiply the denominator by you also need to multiply the	Numerator	4.0
We have 4  3  12 and 1  3 equals	Three	4.0
times say it Katie	One fourth	4.0
What did you guys get	712	4.0
Math message	Just look into the second page	1.0
I always think thats funny when youre in the new version	No its 153	1.0
Its what	Its 153 the first one	1.0
Its 153 the first one	No its 154	1.0
No its 154	No its 153	1.0
Everybody say it with me	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	1.0
Say it with a Southern drawl	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	1.0
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Okay	1.0
Alice	You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	5.0
You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	5.0
Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	So then two times three is six	5.0
So then two times three is six	So then your new fraction is 36	5.0
Are you making that number bigger by multiplying it by one	No	1.0
Yes Eliza	Three times five it would be two times five would be 10 and then you would say	5.0
Right	Which would be five and then two times five will be 10 which you would get 510	5.0
This would be	Five tenths	4.0

Friends lets do the two fifths the whole lot the two the three multiplied by the two the three and the five	Oh thats why they put the grey water up there	1.0
Oh thats why they put the grey water up there	Miss Herd I figured out	1.0
Did you	Uhhuh	1.0
Down below	Uhhuh	1.0
Uhhuh	Can we answer that	1.0
Are you ready to	Yes	1.0
Stand and up and thank this partner	Thank you partner	1.0
See if you have the same thing	I had 5  2	5.0
I had 5  2	So its 410	5.0
So its 410	Then 2  5 is 10	5.0

Go	What I noticed that they  tenths	4.0
What I noticed that they  tenths	Yes both of them  only 110	4.0
Yes both of them  only 110	I think maybe it has to do with 5 and 2 because 5 times 2 is 10	5.0
I think maybe it has to do with 5 and 2 because 5 times 2 is 10	It has to be	2.0
Thats something to do with multiplication rule	Yes	1.0
What are we thinking about for our learning intention today	Because the multiplication	4.0
Because the multiplication	The second number we multiplied was both two times five like this	4.0
turn the screen back to todays learning and  Today were using equivalent fractions to finding common denominator to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a	Multiplication rule	4.0
Faith will you share with us your thinking  please	I said that they are a common denominator and the denominator is the same	4.0
I said that they are a common denominator and the denominator is the same	Also the numerator is 110 of the difference from	4.0
Would you call on someone else please	Me and my partner said is that  the denominator is 10 and the first one is 510 and the second one is 410 so theres a 110 difference too	5.0
Now that you have that my friends can you now that you have common denominators can we add	Yes	1.0
Ready	Lets do this	1.0
12 is equal to	510	4.0
This 12 is the same amount as 510 and then this 25 its the same amount as	410	4.0
510  410 fifth graders what is it	910	4.0
Answer right here is	910	4.0
Whats 12 equivalent	510	4.0
Whats 25 equivalent to	410	4.0
What is 510  410	110	4.0
So my friends what is greater 12 or 25	12	4.0
What do we say to Ms Travers	Thank you Ms Travers	1.0
Were watching to see what his thinking is were not working in our math journals or that ladies	What I did was because she said that the real house looks about twice as wide as it is high so shes trying to say that she wants the house to be wider so I said you can multiply the first coordinate on the Xaxis by two and the new coordinates with 04 and then 00	5.0
What I did was because she said that the real house looks about twice as wide as it is high so shes trying to say that she wants the house to be wider so I said you can multiply the first coordinate on the Xaxis by two and the new coordinates with 04 and then 00	Then I double the Xaxis coordinate so 4x2 is 8 then 4x2 is 8 and then 2x2 is 4	5.0
Then I double the Xaxis coordinate so 4x2 is 8 then 4x2 is 8 and then 2x2 is 4	Then I kept the Yaxis coordinate the same	5.0
Because	Because were not going to make it tSSer were just going to make it wider	5.0
Shelby and you dont like this why	I feel like the house looks like it is about twice as wide as it is high	5.0
I feel like the house looks like it is about twice as wide as it is high	I think its in double both numbers in here	5.0
Pick somebody thats not agreeing with you to respond to you	I reSSy didnt think it was just wider or tSSer	4.0
I reSSy didnt think it was just wider or tSSer	I just thought we had to make it bigger	4.0
Read that for us Marvin	Aster made a giant rubber house on a coordinate that she said that the real house looks like its about twice as wide as it is high	1.0
Aster made a giant rubber house on a coordinate that she said that the real house looks like its about twice as wide as it is high	Her brother said she could change her picture to make it look like a real house	1.0
What are the keywords here River	Twice as wide as it is high	4.0
Team four do you get it now	Yes	1.0
Rylee whats still confusing you	I just dont know how I got done	3.0
You what	I just dont get	3.0
Which axis would you multiply to make it wider	Xaxis	4.0
You guys remember that	Yes	1.0
Where are my handydandy	Book	1.0
Lets read it together	Write a rule that Justly can use to make the picture of the book larger	1.0
Read this question	Describe what you think the new picture will look like	1.0
Describe what you think the new picture will look like	Be specific about how you think the book will change	1.0
Ready Ansley	You have to answer any questions	1.0
Can you talk about question one first so that we can go in order please	In question one we will have to be specific	1.0
In question one we will have to be specific	We cant just say double the coordinates like you would end up doubling the Yaxis or Xaxis	5.0
Okay so a specific rule to make the picture	Yes	1.0
What about number two what are we looking for there	Charlie	4.0
So describe the picture and it says Be specific about how you think the book will change what do you mean by that	These details about how you think the book will change	4.0
Okay Hunter what needs to be on here in order to make the prompt	You have to	1.0
What are those items in between the parenthesis cSSed again	Coordinates	4.0
Help him out partner	Double the first one there	1.0
Milan	You have to remember to write the parenthesis and the comma	4.0
Phyl	ActuSSy make it follow your rule like two times the original	4.0
Charlie	How many plotted lines are there	4.0
Now go on to the next part read number four	Plot the coordinates from a new book on the next screen	1.0
Plot the coordinates from a new book on the next screen	Connect the points in the same order that you plot them	1.0
Sutton	You need to make sure that connect the points in the same order	4.0
If these are the coordinates here when I plot them whats important to make sure happens	That they go in order	4.0
Plot the coordinates for the new book	Make it more tSSer	4.0
Sandra what are we looking for about them plotting the coordinates	We need to make sure that the coordinates	4.0
to add	Make sure youre plotting them based on the rule	4.0
Number five read it	Compare your predictions in problem two to the new picture	1.0
Compare your predictions in problem two to the new picture	How was your prediction correct	1.0
How was your prediction correct	How was your prediction incorrect	1.0
Claud	Compare your predictions with problem two	4.0
What would we be looking for for your answers to these questions	You would be looking for to check if your plots matched the actual	4.0
What are we going to do that make sure that those answers are clear to our reader	To compare them	4.0
What are we going to use that helps us be clear to our reader	Reasoning	4.0
Charlie	I like your thinking and I think you could use details of the instruction and complete sentences	2.0
Stevie	Because youre already more proficient and now youre improficient and explain how you are	4.0
Make sure youre using math vocabulary	So restating the prompt	4.0
Dylan what observations did you and your partner have about this work	the exact same size or smSSer and why do we need it because unless youre closer to that	4.0
Okay but if you look back at the prompt it didnt say where it needs to be it just said he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder so is it breaking the rule to have it there	No	1.0
What would you like to add Milan	I was going to say that if you send that	2.0
Sorry	I see what Rose was thinking in the middle because if youre timesing it like lets say the bottom coordinate was  if youre timesing that by two its going to be  so its going to start on the bottom	5.0
I see what Rose was thinking in the middle because if youre timesing it like lets say the bottom coordinate was  if youre timesing that by two its going to be  so its going to start on the bottom	When youre timesing your coordinates you have to plot it according to the coordinates that you plot on your grid you cant have it floating in the air because that not possible because one of your coordinates	5.0
Does it say that it has to start on these same coordinates in order to be larger	No	1.0
No	It could be on any point	4.0
It could be on any coordinates as long as its larger	I know but how can they be tiny multiplying the coordinates and still have it like if you were timesing one of the coordinates	3.0
Multiplying	Multiplying it could give a totSSy different location	4.0
Multiplying it could give a totSSy different location	I get how it would be larger but I dont know how itd be	3.0
Kirby what did you and your partner decide	We decided it doesnt matter wherever it is when youre following the instructions telling you what to do	4.0
We know that its going to have to be two sections wide so can you make this larger but just put it at different coordinates	Yes	1.0
Im sorry Vanessa	Im just still a little confused how you can move it because we were thinking for example if you look at the coordinate thats	5.0
Im just still a little confused how you can move it because we were thinking for example if you look at the coordinate thats	If youre doubling both of those you can move it because that would  so you can move it	5.0
If youre doubling both of those you can move it because that would  so you can move it	Were confused because some of them are zero coordinates and you cant multiply zero its still going to be zero	5.0
Were confused because some of them are zero coordinates and you cant multiply zero its still going to be zero	Thats what we were thinking	5.0
Thats what we were thinking	Theres no way to move it off that the lines there because its always going to stay in that zero because you cant multiply it	5.0
Theres no way to move it off that the lines there because its always going to stay in that zero because you cant multiply it	If you multiply zero by anything its always going to be zero	5.0
Okay but Sandra respond to her	If you add instead of multiplying if you change your rule to adding adding something to zero will make it one or two or three or four so you could move it instead of making it bigger	5.0
This needs it in terms of getting larger or its not even larger	No	1.0
Does it matter what size	No	1.0
Read the rule with me	Justly can multiply the Xcoordinate by six	1.0
The tunnel looks like a pipe too	Yes	1.0
Did this person make it larger	Yes	1.0
Ryan	He did make it larger but if he was going to only multiply the Xcoordinate that would only make it wider and not forward	5.0
He meant to say what	Multiply the X and Y axis by six	4.0
Read it with me	The folder will be tSSer	1.0
Is it just tSSer	No	1.0
No	Wider	4.0
Looks like he multiplied it by six right	Yes	1.0
Those two things hes a little confused but this part he actuSSy made the coordinates following a different rule to what he wrote so would he be proficient	No	1.0
Lets hear one of your observations Isabel	Its tSSer and not wider	4.0
Did it have to be tSSer and wider	No	1.0
No it just had to be larger so would you say that this is larger	Yes	1.0
What else did you notice Brendan	The reason it was correct it got tSSer on the bottom	5.0
The reason it was correct it got tSSer on the bottom	Thats not reSSy explaining how your prediction was correct or how it was incorrect	5.0
Thats not reSSy explaining how your prediction was correct or how it was incorrect	Hes just giving us five to six more or less on how it was correct	5.0
Hes just giving us five to six more or less on how it was correct	Thats not reSSy telling you how it s correct	5.0
Thats not reSSy telling you how it s correct	Hes just saying it was correct it got tSSer	5.0
Hes just saying it was correct it got tSSer	Hes supposed to explain how it got tSSer and how he got his rule and how the prediction was correct instead	5.0
Hes supposed to explain how it got tSSer and how he got his rule and how the prediction was correct instead	Hes not reSSy explaining how his prediction is correct	5.0
Whats the other observation Leslie	The other observation was that well its good overSS but they could	4.0
Tune here Leslie right here	They forgot to include how it was incorrect	4.0
They forgot to include how it was incorrect	They just said how it was correct	4.0
Asher where else do you use revision in your life	I use revision when Im writing to revise if I make a mistake in my wording or if I just make a mistake	4.0
Kerry whats another way you use revision in your life	When you give me high scores and maybe youre just trying something new like in one of those sports you said if youre trying because first you get it wrong and then eventuSSy you get it right	4.0
What did you and your partner talk about	Whenever youre drawing something or painting something if you mess it up then you could always revise it	4.0
Whenever youre drawing something or painting something if you mess it up then you could always revise it	If you see something wrong you could erase it or make changes to it	4.0
Alison	Another example of revision is when you are camping if you get a screwup you can go back and revise	4.0
Another example of revision is when you are camping if you get a screwup you can go back and revise	Make it right	4.0
Whats another example Carolyn	I ll say buying from the grocery store and you have the grocery store list and you just ran out of a certain item and you forgot to put on the list you revise the rest after youve done that	4.0

Do we agree or disagree with what Laim put up here for 23	I agree	2.0
I agree	I agree	2.0
Oliver you want to try it	Sure	1.0
Lets pick a different color	Miss Carroll why would you do those four lines	3.0
Miss Carroll why would you do those four lines	Just like	1.0
So Elijah what is the answer of 23 of 23	Im still confused a little	3.0
Sophia	46	4.0
Not quite	Its nine	4.0
Its nine	Nine	2.0
Im going to put tick marks by what each team says	We came up with 12 x 13	4.0
So you think this ones bigger	Yes	1.0
Yes	Because	1.0
Oh yes tell me why	if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	5.0
if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	But if you do 12 of a 15 it would be 110 and a 16 has a bigger fraction than	5.0
Team Two which one did you pick	We picked 12 x 13 and we picked it because if you do 12 x 13  16  or when you solve the problem you do that	5.0
We picked 12 x 13 and we picked it because if you do 12 x 13  16  or when you solve the problem you do that	Then also when you solve the problem for 12 x 15 it would  110 which is like Oliver said smaller than 16	5.0
Team Three what did you pick	We got 12 x 13	4.0
Why did you pick that one	Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	4.0
Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	So I just did the problem to make sure and	1.0
And this team	We did 12 x 13	4.0
What was your reasoning	Because	1.0
Team 2 can you listen to Team 4 like they listened to you	We did the problem and we found out that it was the 16 and then 4  3 is	5.0
Team Five which one did you pick	12 x 13	5.0
12 x 13	Because we ust kind of estimated 13 is bigger than 13 and 12  12 and so if you look at this  13 is bigger than	5.0
We have to find one of these squares that we can use its going to be divided in fifths and its going to be divided in thirds to show our work	It has to have that five and three or something	4.0
Thats five and five	Not necessary	4.0
All right draw it	Ive realized that we ve only done this with fractions can we use whole numbers	4.0
Your math message yesterday was 23 of 24 remember  of  means what	Multiply	4.0
All right Im going to give you your sheet each person come up with a problem and then solve it and see if as a team youve come up with the same answers for each problem	We each should have five problems	4.0
Right here at the top theres a place to put five problems	Can the team with six people come to	1.0
Yes if you have six maybe go join another team so you can create a problem for them	Got it	1.0
Be with somebody of your team unless somebody is left out	Im out	1.0
Okay about two more minutes	Is it two	1.0
Okay if were going to have time to play cahoot I need you to switch gears	Were going to play again right	1.0
Yes	What do we do	3.0
Were going to play again	Team	1.0
Did everybody answer	No yes	1.0
Another true or false	red	4.0
Okay last one	What What	1.0
What What	What	1.0
What	Last one	1.0
Last one	Were going to win anyway	1.0
Answer is	Down	4.0
Well say less than or greater than one whole	34	4.0
34	Less than	4.0
Claire	Because if you have 36 and 36 then it would be 66	5.0
Because if you have 36 and 36 then it would be 66	If you had 26  36 it would be a 56	5.0
If you had 26  36 it would be a 56	Then we have 36  46 then you would have 76	5.0
When the numerator is seven is greater than six we know its	Greater than a whole	4.0
Answer is	Greater	4.0
Greater	Greater than	2.0
Why do you say greater than Cooper	Because half of 88 is 4	5.0
Because half of 88 is 4	I put two	4.0
Cooper will you start again please	Yes	1.0
Yes	I had 38 and 28 and I put them together to make 58	5.0
I had 38 and 28 and I put them together to make 58	Then 58  48 is 98 which is more than one whole	5.0
Then 58  48 is 98 which is more than one whole	Then I have a question	1.0
Yes my dear	You said	1.0
My dear	is one	4.0
is one	Its one whole	4.0
Its one whole	One whole	4.0
Do you see one where it one whole	No	1.0
Greater than one whole or less than one	You skipped some T2	1.0
The answer is	She already said that shes going to	1.0
She already said that shes going to	Greater than	4.0
Is it greater than or less than one whole	Greater than	4.0
Austin can you tell us why its greater than one whole	I know that 5  5 is 10 and 10 is greater than 8	5.0
108 is greater than one whole	Yes	1.0
Great	Well its usually like	1.0
You	What	1.0
Everybody say Interval	Interval	1.0
Go	You can figure out the scale of a line plot by looking at a set data	1.0

Each number has the same	have to find the same thing	4.0
With an equal amount of space	Yes	1.0
What does that mean and why is that important	I think it means like how many inches they are	4.0
Would you call on the next person for us please	Austin	1.0
Austin	Me and Aiden said that an interval or space between them means the difference or the amount between	4.0
The difference in between the	The numbers in a line plot	4.0
The numbers in a line plot	The unit	4.0
The unit	Student	1.0
Ethan will you add on to that please	Yes I also wanted to share	1.0
Excellent	We both have a bunch of paper and then	1.0
When were talking about interval we want to think about that as an equal or same space between the numbers	Yes between the two of them	4.0
Whats the unit	Inches	4.0
In order from the	Smallest	4.0
To the	Largest	4.0
The line plot shows measurement data in Whats the interval	Half an inch	4.0
Thats tricky isnt it	Yes	1.0
You want to start	I have this one question that goes one has two and one onehalf	4.0
I have this one question that goes one has two and one onehalf	Thats what was confusing	1.0
How many insects were measured	11	4.0
11	20	2.0
20	22	2.0
Aiden would you be willing to share	I think	1.0
Thank you for starting us	I	1.0
Josh	I counted the top I got 22	4.0
How	I counted the top it came out as 11	4.0
How many points in that set of data was	11	4.0
11	Then the bottom had the exact same number	4.0
Then the bottom had the exact same number	I just added eleven	4.0
Then 11  11 was	22	4.0
Did you do it a little different Paris	What I did was I knew that there were nine and the two inches	5.0
What I did was I knew that there were nine and the two inches	Then a seven in two and a half	5.0
Then a seven in two and a half	I took 3 and I added it to the 7 to get 10 plus the 9 plus the 3 to get 22	5.0
Say it	Three and a half	4.0
Three and a half what	Inches	4.0
Tell your shoulder partner	One and a half	4.0
One and a half what	Inches	4.0
Noah do your	I think its four halves is the differenceone and one half to minimum	4.0
Noah Im hearing you say four halves from one and one half to three and one half	Or two wholes because theyre both that one half and one plus two equals three	5.0
Or two wholes because theyre both that one half and one plus two equals three	Thats how I know its two	5.0
Good thinking	Then I revise my thinking with the	1.0
Our first step to organize and think about the data is to put the measurements in order from what	Smallest to largest	4.0
What is the smallest measurement	3 12	4.0
Do we have any other 3 12	No	1.0
No	Its the only one	4.0
Do we have any 3 34	Yes	1.0
Yes	We have three	4.0
How many times do you see 3 34	Four	4.0
You should write down 3 34 how many times	Four	4.0
Whats our next biggest measurements	4 12	4.0
How many times do we have four inches	Three times	4.0
Then what is our largest piece of data	4 12	4.0
We have to look at the denominator	Was it 4 34	4.0
Was it 4 34	I couldnt	1.0
You have your data on your sheet	I didnt get to write it all down	1.0
I didnt get to write it all down	It goes one half and then	4.0
Friends I want us all to think about if our smallest piece of data is Whats our smallest	3 12	4.0
Our largest is	4 12	4.0
Whats in the middle of three inches and four inches	3 12	4.0
Whats in the middle of four inches and five inches	4 12	4.0
4 12	Is it okay if I did this	1.0
We can place the Xs on our line plot right	Yes	1.0
How many 3 12 did we have	One	4.0
Whats next	3 34	4.0
How many 3 34 did we have	Four	4.0
Four	I thought we had five	2.0
Was there a five	Yes I thought so	1.0
3 34 ones two three four	You need a half	4.0
How many times did four occur in the measurement above	Three times	4.0
Whats the next data point	4 12	4.0
Do we have any 4 14	I dont think so	1.0
I dont think so	No we dont have any	4.0
Do we have any 4 12	Yes	1.0
How many	Two	4.0
Two	One	2.0
One	Two	2.0
Lets look at the data	One	4.0
One	Two	2.0
Two	Two	2.0
Are we at 4 12 now	Yes	1.0
How many 4 12 did we have	Two	4.0
Two	Wait two	1.0
Wait two	Yes	1.0
Yes	Oh my God yes two	2.0
Is that the highest	Yes its the highest	4.0
Yes its the highest	thats the highest	2.0
Is that the greatest	Yes	1.0
What is this line plot all about	About	3.0
What does this information represent on the bottom	The No	1.0
The No	Length	4.0
In what	Inches	4.0
In the data how many stag beetles were about four inches	Three	4.0
Go	Three	4.0
We have stag beetles and we know that because we have three Xs each X represents one piece of data	I thought these were plants	1.0
My friends T2 its not a stag beetle its a what	Sunflower	4.0
We appreciate you	Yep	1.0
Ready	37	1.0
37	170	1.0
170	170	1.0
170	173	1.0
Shes going to measure all the way around my head and then shes going to show you on the screen what the measurement is to the nearest half centimeter	Ms Miller is going to drop it	1.0
Ms Miller is going to drop it	Mason go to your seat	1.0
Now if she said Measure to the nearest half does that mean that it will always fall on the half	No	1.0
Heres 54 centimeters 54 and	A half	4.0
Just be careful you have to start it	What if you end it like	1.0
You have a question Paris	No Im holding it	1.0
Tell me what was your head measurement please	I got 53 and one half	4.0
I got 53 and one half	Thats what I got	2.0
Fern	54 and a half	4.0
Okay keep going	I got 54	4.0
Aiden	I got 53	4.0
Okay Tina	54	4.0
Austin	54 and a half	4.0
Okay Jake	54 and a half	4.0

Okay Kyle	52 and a half	4.0
Brian	51	4.0
Jenna	54	4.0
Alyssa	50	4.0
Ethan	51	4.0
Cooper	53 and a half	4.0
50 and a half	No 53 and a half	1.0
Okay Hannahn	55	4.0
Okay Miguel	53	4.0
Hannah	50	4.0
Brady	49	4.0
Okay Josh	64	4.0
64	Geez thats a big head	1.0

What did you say	53	4.0
Sorry	53	4.0
Mason	52	4.0
Michael	53	4.0
Claire	56	4.0
Emily	50 and a half	4.0
50 and a half	Ive got the smallest head	4.0
Ive got the smallest head	I have the smallest head	4.0
Where did your thinking land Paris	We said 49 would be the smallest and 56 would be the biggest	4.0
49 has the smallest and say it again	56 as the largest	4.0
Paris did you guys talk about interval	Not yet	1.0
Was there any team that talked about an interval	We were confused	1.0
Quarter centimeters	I think we should put them off by half	4.0
Why do you think halves	Actually whole	4.0
Christian would you share the thinking that your team had about the intervals	We thought that we should do half centimeters because most people got half I think and we use centimeters to measure our heads	5.0
Stand up if you have different thinking	About what	3.0
Stand up if you would like to add on or have a different idea or comment about how we should set up our line plot in intervals	Stand up Max	1.0
Max	Can I add	1.0
Yes	I think we should also set up in half centimeters because a lot of the numbers are halves between each of the numbers like 54 and 54 and a half and then 55 and then theres 54	5.0
Cooper you were going to say something similar	I was going to say if we do ones	4.0
Okay	If we do one as the interval were going to skip some because one cant justcut in half interval	5.0
If we do one as the interval were going to skip some because one cant justcut in half interval	That would be a	1.0
What is our smallest number in the set	49	4.0
49	49	2.0
Next will be 49 and	We have no 49 and	4.0
We have no 49 and	I cant do it still	1.0
Someone said we dont have a 49 and a half	That was Anna	1.0
Why do we still have to put 49 and a half on it	I thought we were counting all of these on here	1.0
I thought we were counting all of these on here	one half as the interval	4.0
I think the large interval should be 56  because we wont fill it all	Yes were not going to fill it up	1.0
What do these numbers represent	Centimeters	4.0
Good job	I think that should be	1.0
I think that should be	Its the perfect amount	1.0
Its the perfect amount	What about circumference	4.0
You definitely could use the word circumference	Or could we just write centimeters	4.0
I would add the word distance so that you know its not just a straight line because we are looking at the distance around something	T2 you said a 53 5 and a half	1.0
How about that it worked out just perfectly	Just barely perfect	1.0
My friends before we go ahead and complete our line plot what should the title of our line plot be	Circumference	4.0
Circumference	Class	2.0
Class what	Heads	4.0
Dont forget that titles need	Capitals	1.0
capitals on all the important words	What about the bottom	1.0
What about the bottom	You didnt put capitals	1.0
Here we go my friends	Wait I missed that	1.0
Our smallest is 49 right	Yes	1.0
How many times did 49 happen	One	4.0
Do we have any 49 and a halfs	No	4.0
Did we have any 50 centimeters	Yes	1.0
Lets count how many	One two	1.0
Two students in ourSShave a head size of 50 centimeters	Hannah and Alyssa	1.0
Did we have any 50 and one halfs	Yes one	1.0
We one	We have two	4.0
Just two	Yes	1.0
51 and one half	No	1.0
My friends do I put anything in the 51 and one half	No	1.0
52 we have one	Two	4.0
We have one	Just one	1.0
Okay	53	1.0
One two three four	Three people	4.0
We one two three four	Thats it	1.0
55	One two	4.0
We have two	Two zero and then we have two	4.0
We have	Two 56	4.0
Two 56	Thats all	1.0
Thats all	No more 56 12	4.0
I would like you to look at your thinking partner the one you measured your head with look at your person wave at them say Thank you for being my partner	Thank you for being my partner	1.0
Were going to turn our eyes and ears to number four	Aiden	1.0
Aiden	You didnt ask anything	1.0
What is this	We did that so that Its a line plot and why we didnt just do a normal data thing where we write it because if we just did that then it would be like hard to read	5.0
We did that so that Its a line plot and why we didnt just do a normal data thing where we write it because if we just did that then it would be like hard to read	Its easier to just let those two people that have 50 and the three that 54 12	5.0
We could look up here and say Wow the largest head size in ourSSis what	56	4.0
How many kids in ourSShave a head size of 56 centimeters	Two	4.0

Talk friend thats why I gave you the mic	Im dealing with multiples of five right now	4.0
Im dealing with multiples of five right now	get a common denominator of	4.0
Its confused because youre holding the pen and Maybe hand off the pen to your partner or something	Im  with that because theres a multiple I know theyre the same numbers	5.0
Im  with that because theres a multiple I know theyre the same numbers	the denominator would be five	5.0
the denominator would be five	5	5.0
5	No 14  and then 3515	5.0
Derek phone a friend or if you know say	She looked at the multiples and she counted how many multiples into the common denominator	4.0

610 is		4.0
Yes sir	I dont get how they got 1520	3.0
All right do I have anybody who wants to come up and clearly show where the 1520 came from using maybe the strategy I used over there	Do you want me to do the whole problem or just that one part	1.0
Do you want me to do the whole problem or just that one part		1.0
Just that one part you asked for the 1520 right	Yes	1.0
Okay	Okay so what you do is you	1.0
Pass this to Luka	So  times five I mean well  times five which is 15	5.0
So  times five I mean well  times five which is 15	Then we found our denominator is 20 so we just	5.0
Then we found our denominator is 20 so we just	Okay	1.0
Two things the	Numerator and denominator	4.0

So lets head back	Purple	1.0
Theres a mechanical pencil	Can we get snacks	1.0
My expectation is that you are working in 10 seconds		4.0
So where is the 18 coming from	Like maybe on your whiteboard its like	1.0
Whats this number called in a fraction	Numerator	4.0
Whats the bottom one called	Denominator	4.0
Four eight	12 16 20	5.0
We re on number two	Number two	1.0
No whats the other denominator		4.0
Do I need to keep going	No	1.0
Whats the equivalent fraction for 56	1518	4.0
I might say  Write 1518 minus  whats the other fraction	418	4.0
418 because this is showing your work right	Yes	1.0
Then I might say 15 minus four equals		4.0
What have you found frustrating about the SageNScribe Eloise	My partner not telling me exactly where to put the numbers	1.0
Please use us because thats our job	So	1.0
What do I need to do	Wait is that in right now	1.0
So you write what I wrote here	Everyone is weird	1.0
Everyone is weird	If youre not weird then youre weird in a bad way	1.0
Thank you	Well no	1.0
Well no	We multiply both of them by	4.0
Just bring it to me because right now were doing math on something that it seems like we need some help with	Can you help me with this at least	3.0
Our lesson builds off of the lesson youve had over the last couple of days about using read these words with me powers	Powers of 10	1.0
Today were going to be converting measurements in the metric system using what	Powers of 10	4.0
I will	I will multiply and divide by powers of 10  in metric unit	1.0
Break the problem in two parts	Break the problem in two parts	1.0
Determine how the units are related	Determine how the units are related	1.0
Name the rule using exponential notation	Name the rule using exponential notation	1.0
10 to the	X2	4.0
And	310	4.0
Divided by 102	Power of 2	4.0
How do you know how far to move the decimal	I just wanted to remove the point	1.0
Can you all hear him	No	1.0
Speak up	When you multiply you make the number bigger so you attach the zeros behind the number you started with and then	5.0
For division	Yes when you divide you make the number smaller	5.0
Yes when you divide you make the number smaller	You move the decimal in front of the number you started with	5.0
What could we respond	I think you got most of it right and I would agree with  My thinking is similar because	2.0
Ive asked Aubrey to come explain come up and show hers and you still have your marker so you can add on to yours while youre here	To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times as the exponent says	5.0
To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times as the exponent says	This occurs the same when you multiply instead of left you shift the decimal to the right	5.0
This occurs the same when you multiply instead of left you shift the decimal to the right	I showed this by showing the problems and turning the decimal moving to the left and to the right and then showing the answer	5.0
I would like you to call on some classmates to respond from our math talk	Anna	1.0
Thanks for noticing that	Jon	1.0
Jon	I like how you use the vocabulary  and you are very clear what you were saying and how you do it  and how it works	2.0
I like how you use the vocabulary  and you are very clear what you were saying and how you do it  and how it works	Faith	1.0
Faith	I liked how you	2.0
Aubrey would you read it to us one more time and I want everyone to be thinking does it accurately explain the rule	To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times the exponent says	5.0
To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times the exponent says	This occurs the same when you multiply but instead of left you shift the decimal to the right	5.0
Why	What is the answer to the quotient	3.0
Wherever youre sitting would you please turn so that you are in a team of two or three	Me to me	1.0
Me to me	We actually already have	1.0
Jon thank you	This rule works because when multiplying youre moving the decimal point to the right making your number bigger	5.0
Yes and why does it work shifting the decimal to the left for division	It makes it smaller	4.0
Riley	when you are multiplying  and when youre moving the decimal to the right it makes the whole number larger	5.0
Will it shift to the left or the right	Left	4.0
Say it	Two	4.0
Is this your new quotient	Yes	1.0
be moving to the right or the left which way friends	Right	4.0
How many place values	Two	4.0
Are we shifting it to the left or to the right	Left	4.0
Say it	Two	4.0
Go	0373	4.0
I want to hear your voices first step is what	Break the problem into parts	4.0
Second step	Determine how the units are related	4.0
Third step	Make a rule using exponential notation	4.0
We want to make sure that we are breaking it into parts thinking about the units and answering with a rule using what powers of	10	4.0
Did you answer with powers of 10	Oh	1.0
Jack would you mind sharing with us what is this problem asking us to do	Its asking us what are the rules	4.0
What information do we have to help us get started	We have the first problem we solved for the first part	4.0
The first part of the rule so tell us what that means	that	1.0
In one meter we have how many centimeters	A 100	4.0
Class	100	2.0
100 so if we had 2 meters how many centimeters would we have	200	4.0
Were going to keep going three meters	300	4.0
Four meters	400	4.0
Five meters	500	4.0
Anyone willing to share	Times 102	4.0
How did you know it was times 10 multiplied by time 102 tell us your thinking	Because I saw that we are adding up	5.0
Have we done it before	Yes	1.0
When centimeters are divided by 102 the decimal point shifts two places to the what	Left	4.0
Were just solving numbers	One	1.0
One of you if you are the scribe you are the writer if you are the Ivy you are the	Talker	1.0
What problems are you solving right now	Two	1.0
We know theres	We know if you have 1 is equals to	4.0
Think back to Remember our success criteria where our rule has to be expressed in a power of	Oh yes	1.0
47 so its 10 to	To power of	4.0
If you move the decimal one place	To the power of one	4.0
Go back to Faith	I know  to the power of 1 because youre adding one 0 and then moving the decimal point one place over	5.0
Is you product larger or smaller	Larger	4.0
Now Aaron you are the Ivy and youre explaining number three to Faith	Yes	1.0
Aaron why dont you read that for us	The rule is	1.0
What do you think Faith	This is 2	4.0
If you start with 1000 and your answer is 1 is our answer larger or smaller	Smaller	4.0
When you divide youre dividing something into pieces and its getting smaller	dividing to the power of three	4.0
10 to the third power	Yes	1.0
Lets think about if you know youre dividing by 10 to the third power youre going to be moving the decimal how many places	Two	4.0
Which way left or right	Left	4.0
Talk through how do you know that this is 8000	You know this is 8000 because	1.0
You are going to have a sevendigit number	I put zeros in front of it	4.0
Nine in the thousands	After	1.0
After	Just remember when you multiply	1.0
Here hundredths is right here	Equals 0 0 8	4.0
Were in the tens not tenths tens so thats right here	Did you say zero	1.0
Okay that should be a 2	10 divide by	4.0
10 divide by	Do we do page	1.0
Have you figured out what the rule is	Yes	1.0
1 times 10 is 10	It says which number sentence matches the picture below	1.0
It says which number sentence matches the picture below	Fill in the circle next to the best answer	1.0

Awesome job coming quickly	Everybody freeze	1.0
Power of	10	4.0
Do you have times 10 to the first power	Yes	1.0
Then my friends in number three the rule would be divided by 10 to the what	Power of three	4.0
When you are done with number four	Oh its not 1000	4.0
Oh its not 1000	Its 1000	2.0
Its 1000	Thats 20000	4.0
Milligram there must be what	100000	4.0
If milli means thousand how many milligrams are there in a gram	100000	4.0
Im going to start from 1 gram to 1000 milligrams	Okay	1.0
Write down milligrams grams	We need to read the directions	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
Theyre not reading this	No I didnt read it	1.0
1000 is 10 to what power	Third	4.0
When youre ready for us to look at your answer youll raise your hand high and well give you your next step	I think were dividing it there	4.0
I think were dividing it there	I think were multiplying	2.0
Thats why I wanted to show that to you	I dont think this will have to do anything	1.0
Yes move on to the next page	Oh okay	1.0
If youre dividing it by 10 to the power of 3	Look at the rule	4.0
Look at the rule	Howd you	1.0
Yes but what goes right here is this	Okay	1.0

If I could go anywhere for 30 minutes and not have any responsibilities right now if I could magically transport somewhere Id like to go skiing by myself	Why	1.0
What would you do	I would go to Fiji to surf	1.0
That sounds amazing have you been there	No but Ive been surfing a lot	1.0
Where have you been surfing	Off the coast of North Carolina	1.0
Clear or cloudy	Clear as the sky	1.0
Are you clear	Yes	1.0
Ready go	Today we will use the displacement method to measure the volume of objects	1.0
Partner B please read it	I will be successful when I understand how to measure volume by displacement	1.0
I will be successful when I understand how to measure volume by displacement	I will explain why displacement method works for measuring volume	1.0
Nora	It is length times width times height	4.0
Nora would you say that one more time please	The volume is length times width times height	4.0
Okay	The inside of an object	4.0
Aria	Volume is the amount of space an object takes up	4.0
Victoria	The measurement inside an object	4.0
Naomi	Its	1.0
Volume is	Volume is also base times height	4.0
Logan what do we know about volume	Its the space that an object takes up	4.0
Did you guys do something on volume yesterday	Yes	1.0
Do we know	A thousand	4.0
A thousand how did we know	Base times height	4.0
Sarah	area of the base times height	4.0
Why	Because its quite easy	5.0
How would you do that	Length of the bottom times	4.0
Length times width	Times width	4.0
Then times the height	Yes	1.0
How would you find the volume of this	I would multiply the area of the base multiplied by the height	4.0
Right so will that trend always work when you have a rectangular prism or a cube	Yes	1.0
You see that top picture up there	Yes	1.0
Ally Ive not heard from you yet today	You probably could but it might be a little harder because the base area might be like right here on the bottom it might not be the same height or the same width as the whole	5.0
Lydia please call on someone to add on or to share some different thinking	Me and my partner thought that we wouldnt be able to use the same strategy just a little like they said because it doesnt really have a base or size that you could find the length and width of so it would be really hard if we tried to use that strategy	5.0
Me and my partner thought that we wouldnt be able to use the same strategy just a little like they said because it doesnt really have a base or size that you could find the length and width of so it would be really hard if we tried to use that strategy	Because of this round size were thinking we wouldnt really be able to find the	5.0
A different method	Yes its round so its a lot harder to find the length and width	5.0
Could you call someone else to add on	We kind of thought that it wouldnt work	4.0
When you say it what do you mean by it	The strategies	4.0
To find the volume	Of the base	5.0
Of the base	We kind of thought that you would have to say like you would have to find the square	5.0
We kind of thought that you would have to say like you would have to find the square	If theres lines on the croquet balls we thought wed count the lines and those would be like layers and how many cubes	5.0
A sphere	A sphere	1.0
Do you have your whiteboard in front of you	Yes	1.0
Say displacement	Displacement	1.0
Displacement	To share	4.0
Aria	Maybe to put something in the wrong spot	4.0
Right	Yes	1.0
All right Ellie	Maybe if youre playing with Legos and you put it in the wrong spot	4.0
Are you thinking dis might mean wrong	Yes	1.0
Jack	I know that dis it sounds like misplace though its different so it has almost the same meaning	4.0
You need to open up to page 214	214 or 215	1.0
214 I believe	214	1.0
Yes you could freeze it	How do you freeze it	1.0
I got it	You just press	1.0
Adam	I thought that the water would rise because the croquet ball would take away space from it so it forces the water to spread out kind of	5.0
Maya	I think the water will rise and show on the scale how much it rises	4.0
Brielle	We mightve thought that when we drop the croquet ball in the water the weight will push it down so itll rise	5.0
We mightve thought that when we drop the croquet ball in the water the weight will push it down so itll rise	We know that we started at zero and then well count how much it rose	5.0
It starts with a V	Volume	4.0
Ready	It floats	4.0
I liked your estimate	175	4.0
Maya did you want to add something	I noticed that the ball is floating is it still taking up volume of the whole area	5.0
I just think you can answer your own question by the end of the lesson okay	Okay	1.0
Sorry Ms Bayer Im actually going to have him put the	Sorry	1.0
Thank you for being my second and third teacher	Of course	1.0
Could we use the same volume method	Maybe	1.0
Go	Use the displacement method to find the volume in milliliters of one base 10 flat two base 10 flats and three based 10 flats	1.0
Use the displacement method to find the volume in milliliters of one base 10 flat two base 10 flats and three based 10 flats	Record the volumes in volume	1.0
In milliliters	Column of the table below	1.0
They are 100 centimeters that are in a cubeshape in this flat correct	Yes	1.0
So we have 100 cubic centimeters one flat is equal to what	A hundred	4.0
Are you ready for some fun now	Yes	1.0
Emma	That each one gets	1.0
Nora	I said I noticed the milliliters and centimeters are equal	4.0
Do each of you have number three complete	Yes	1.0
Does that sound okay	Yes	1.0
Does that make sense	Yes	1.0
You should be standing with a brand new partner	Okay	1.0
Okay	For the second one what is it	3.0
For the second one what is it	I got 09	4.0
I got 09	Then the other one I got  and then the other one I got	1.0
Elijah	We got every single one the same	4.0
Excellent	besides the second green one	4.0
The second green one Elijah and was your partner Ava	Yes	1.0
Would you ask your classmates if theres someone that could help us with our understanding of this	If youre looking at your white board the threes and the tenths place right now and so that would make it 30	5.0
If youre looking at your white board the threes and the tenths place right now and so that would make it 30	If you move it over to the next one that would make it 300s	5.0
Was there another question for mental math William	Im not very sure  every time you do a hundred point zero	3.0
Can you see it over there Suzanna	Yes	1.0
Go	Solve multistep multiplication number stories	1.0
Jake what did you guys talk about	We thought it was just like a multiplestep problem	4.0
What does that mean multiplestep problem	Theres many steps in one problem	4.0
What do you do when you multiply	Times	4.0
How are we feeling about the learning target today	Cool	1.0
Cool	Good	1.0
Go	Answer in a single number model using parenthesis	1.0
Go	So it looks like  five	4.0
So it looks like  five	Five times seven times five so that you have	2.0
Wyatt what do you think this means	I said to my partner that it means that theres one number model using parenthesis	4.0
sentence	Equation	4.0
Equation	With parenthesis its like youre using parenthesis to do if it was five times five plus two times five what you would do is	5.0
Five	Times five plus two times five	5.0
William	Could we also write down the letter that begins if you know the answer	4.0
Estimate	Estimate each	1.0
Elijah tell us about this second bullet	Estimate is an educated guess	4.0
When you say educated what do you use to make that educated guess	Like you use  to make that guess like you take the stuff from the problem and do maybe use it and round it or something	4.0
You might use rounding or you might take parts of the problem	Away	4.0
away so that you can just look at parts and say Does my answer make sense when I multiply those two numbers	Youd like to make the problem easier and then youll see if your answer that you got is Most of the time in math process we have to see if our answer is  to our estimate	5.0
Youd like to make the problem easier and then youll see if your answer that you got is Most of the time in math process we have to see if our answer is  to our estimate	If we got 3700 for our estimate it has to be somewhere near that number	5.0
Go	Answer with units	4.0
Are we able  Leo	Answer with units mean its like when you get your answer for your problem you want to	4.0
You will have a word like dollars or whats another one William	Inches	4.0
You need to have that unit	Unit  is a keyword	4.0
Were going to say single number model with	Parentheses	4.0
We need an	Estimate	4.0
And we need	Units	4.0

What do you guys think	Yes	1.0
So far	Why does	1.0
What do you guys Fourth graders what do we think	Subtract	4.0
How do you know	Because thats how much more	5.0
The tap dancers 12  33 Im going to use	Bow tie	4.0
What multiplication strategy do I know	Bow tie	4.0
Okay	Bow tie	4.0
Thirty times 10 is	Three thousand	4.0
Three thousand	Thirty times time	4.0
Three hundred	Wait 33 times	4.0
Right	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Now I need 30  2 which is	Fiftysix	4.0
Sixty and 10  3 which is	Thirty	4.0
Three times two is	Six	4.0
So far the tap dancers cost	Three hundred ninetysix	4.0
I know 6  3 is what	Eighteen	4.0
Eighteen and I can attach the zero and get	One hundred eighty	4.0
Now 396  180 is	Two hundred sixteen	4.0
You dont think	Wait	1.0
Wait	Hold on because	1.0
So  since youre over there what two words when were estimating we use what	Round to each numbers	4.0
Round to get easy numbers so 400  200 is	Two hundred	4.0

All right would you two start for us please	First we did 40 x 16  8 x 3 x 22   because its a unit	5.0
Me too	Then I did 12 x 16 and  then I got 192 and then on my side corner I did 24 x 22  528	5.0
Then I did 12 x 16 and  then I got 192 and then on my side corner I did 24 x 22  528	Then after I did that I did 528  192 because those are my two answers and that equals 336	5.0
The difference in the amount is 336 what	Dollars	4.0
Audience would you please put your eyes back to the screen	I did the same problem as Brendan since were partners and I used partial products but then when Brendan got a different answer from me he was using ladders so I decided to use some ladders so I could see if our answers were the same	2.0
I did the same problem as Brendan since were partners and I used partial products but then when Brendan got a different answer from me he was using ladders so I decided to use some ladders so I could see if our answers were the same	Then he revised his thinking to be the same answer as mine and we got 4 x 3 x 16 because for the singing group there was four performers three hours and 16 per hour	2.0
Then he revised his thinking to be the same answer as mine and we got 4 x 3 x 16 because for the singing group there was four performers three hours and 16 per hour	Then for the tumblers there was eight performers it was three hours and it was 22 per hour so then we took 8 x 3 to get 24 and 4 x 3 to get 12 and then 12 x 16 to get 192 and 24 x 22 to get 528 and then 528  192 equals	5.0
336	Then we estimated and we rounded 528 to 500	5.0
We didnt get done so what should you do at the carpet right now if you didnt get done	Trying to finish off	4.0
Why	To see each others thinking	4.0
To see each others thinking	I dont know	1.0
Were just going to show one journal right now because of time but Hunter and Jake their thinking was similar and together so Hunter share with us how you solved	We started with our number model of the unknown	5.0
We started with our number model of the unknown	We had 8 x 3 x 22 represents the jugglers	5.0
We had 8 x 3 x 22 represents the jugglers	Sorry the tumblers had eight performers three hours and 22 an hour	5.0
Sorry the tumblers had eight performers three hours and 22 an hour	We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait	5.0
We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait	Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528	5.0
Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528	Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour	5.0
Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour	Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16	5.0
Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16	192	5.0
192	Because we did the estimate before we did our answer	5.0
Say that again Hunter	We did our estimate before our answer so that we could figure out our answer before we did it	5.0
Okay	Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200	5.0
Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200	We took out 200 from 530 too and got 330 and then with our number model we did 528  192 and got 336 and since 336 is our answer we only need six off of our estimate	5.0
Can I have some questions comments or feedback for Hunter and Jake	The tables are off more	4.0
The tables are off more	Yes I can try	1.0
Yes I can try	I liked how you explained your work	2.0
I liked how you explained your work	You did it so it was easy to understand	2.0

Seeing yours and Skylars I just now saw that I forgot some steps so I went back and did it again	I like how you guys showed it like how Skylar showed it and Maddison and	2.0
Are you going back and changing it right now in your journal	Yes	1.0
Hunter what is the answer and what is the units	33600	4.0
What	I just realized that	1.0
Heres your job	Excuse me	1.0
Snack problem number two go	Excuse me	1.0
Yes	Do we estimate number two	1.0
Thats the scoop for today any questions on that	Yes its quite a scoop	1.0
On your switch	Yes	1.0
If you can show me if we could stamp off all of your toolkits then Ill be happy	My toolkit is not done	1.0
My toolkit is not done	Theres still one loophole she uses so	1.0
Alright guys Im going to send you a video youre going to like	Yes	1.0
Yes all right yes	Thats the	1.0
Yes were like this	I dont	1.0
Hey would we have the reminder weekly test	Okay done with this and mine	1.0
Okay done with this and mine	Yes I dont know if its	1.0
I did eliminate several of the problems from the review because youre not responsible for those so not every problem from the review is there but most of the problem I think its might be 32 of them or something like that	For the quiz is it just like 38 or is it like the cumulative like that	1.0
I think its 12	Squeaky key	1.0
Right so go ahead and turn in your groups and whoever wants to start can go ahead and get going	As F of X heads towards negative infinity F of X will decrease	1.0
As F of X heads towards negative infinity F of X will decrease	So well say it moves towards negative infinity	4.0
So well say it moves towards negative infinity	Did you give it a go	2.0
Did you give it a go	You should try Grady	1.0
You should try Grady	So what did you find as the degree of this	3.0
So what did you find as the degree of this	by multiplying this by this by this squared  Think about what is the degree	5.0
by multiplying this by this by this squared  Think about what is the degree	Were done	1.0
All right guys page 98	Location principle	4.0
The location principle go ahead Colin tell us what it is	It acts as a polynomial function and A and B are two real numbers such that FMA is less than zero and that would be as greater than zero that F has at least one real zero between A and B	1.0
Thats a lot of math talk for something thats pretty simple were saying that in this particular case our Yvalue is greater than zero so Y is	Positive	4.0
Ive got some Bvalue and a Y this point could be anywhere in this pink area then the same thing is true over here Y is less than zero so Y is	A negative	4.0
Anybody have a question on that or need to hear somebody else explain it	To summarize this segment theres one point between A and B thats where Y is zero	4.0
Yes makes  sense	Oh thats hard to see that theres a zero	1.0
Cooper could you read number one for me please	The graph of every polynomial function of degree N has at most N1 turning points	1.0
The graph of every polynomial function of degree N if I look here whats the degree of this one	Three	4.0
What would 31 be	Two	4.0
Two	Two	2.0
It has two	Turning points	4.0
Thats all this is saying what could the degree of this one be	Four	4.0
Four could be more than that but basically four so 41 is	Three	4.0
One two three turning points	I like this	1.0
In this location I have a minimum and in this location Ive got a minimum as well so we use that term local minimum then over here we have one two three four five	Quintic	4.0
Quintic 51 one two three four turning points and the reason it says at most was because remember something like this could actually look like that	It could still be Quintic	4.0
And still be Quintic	I was going to say couldnt it actually be more than Quantic though couldnt be sextic	4.0
Yes and you have the right idea that its got to be an odd number because its going in different directions	Because your sign is there based on what you have	4.0
Brad could you read number two for us	If a polynomial equation has N	1.0
Zeros means	Xintercept	4.0
How many turning points we have for	Those two go hand in hand because the degree determines	5.0
Only two types of symmetry that were testing Yaxis and about the origin	Why is it called odd or even though	3.0
Why is it called odd or even though	Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function	4.0
Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function	Thats really weird	1.0
I know and but in a certain sense thats also what we thought of with odd and even degrees too though is positive and negative	Yes	1.0
Yes	On average it seems to be the function with odd degrees	4.0
On average it seems to be the function with odd degrees	Well they seem to be tend to be more on the neither side or the odd side at least from what I can tell	4.0
Well they seem to be tend to be more on the neither side or the odd side at least from what I can tell	They seem to have that more capability being	4.0
Page 101 has our essential question and Dante could you read that for me please	How can you find a time on the old model for reallife data	1.0
All right so Andy what is it	Something gets modeled with a polynomial	4.0
What am I handing you	A graph	1.0
I could be a graph or	A table	1.0
A table or	A chart	4.0
I know Christian you like to look at patterns	I do indeed	1.0
Step one were going to use our Xintercepts of 4 to create the factor X4	How	3.0
Does my red polynomial have the same Xintercept	Would that be imaginary	4.0
Would that have the same Xintercepts	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes but its a much  function	2.0
What makes the difference	The A	4.0
Yes	When you multiply into standard form do you multiply the set of intercepts by themselves in that A value or do you distribute it or	3.0
If I asked you to do that tell me how to do it	Just go across then okay	4.0
Whats the answer to this going to be or do I do 2x3 and get six and 2x4 and get eight and multiply that together to get 48	Multiply with the 1 2 by the X4 and move that to X times the X1	5.0
I wouldnt want to multiply the 1 2 times an odd number probably	Okay so just multiply them all basically	4.0
Now go back to this one and see if you can figure out how to start	If it is in parentheses I get three and then do I subtract it over or do I divide it over	3.0
Well what are we doing with all of those	We said its equal to zero	4.0
Well actually you said its equal to three	so then do I subtract this over here	4.0
We adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	Multiplying	4.0
Multiplying so multiply them all together and what do you get	3 times A is 3	5.0
Are adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	They are multiplying	4.0
They are multiplying	So  equals X	4.0
So you divide both sides by 3	Then Ill have to write out the whole thing	4.0
Yes	Do we have to do exercises 5 through 8	1.0
so which one of those factors gets squared	X1	1.0
X1	Thats where it bounces	4.0
Neil just go the behind Cody then you can go to the last desk up there	Are we allowed to use the books too	1.0
Take all the other stuff out it then	Thank you	1.0
You want to take it	Yes sure	1.0
They said Theres someone at my table who has their quadrilateral in a different place than mine is their answer still correct	Yes	1.0
Even if its not the same as yours	Its because its still the same thing	4.0
Its because its still the same thing	If mine was reSSy big and Sammys was reSSy smSS itll still be the same thing	4.0
How is it the same thing	Theyre still the same shapes	4.0
Elex	It also says plot any three points	2.0
Why do you say that Brendan	I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	5.0
I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1	5.0
Ravier	They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	5.0
They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25	5.0
What would you like to add to that Kyle	I agree with everybody but I also want to add that you could actuSSy answer that the same because you could make it a mixed number or an improper fraction	5.0
Shout it out	Equal fractions	4.0
Hannah	First I said maybe when youre baking something you could have for example cookies you could have a certain amount of flour maybe a more exact amount maybe you could I dont know convert it to a more precise expression	5.0
Pick somebody thats trying or what to communicate with you	I agree with you and I see how you did that but Id like to add on to your idea	2.0
I agree with you and I see how you did that but Id like to add on to your idea	I like your idea of if youre baking to have this measurement lets say the tool will make the baking so unique if it doesnt have that measurement	5.0
I like your idea of if youre baking to have this measurement lets say the tool will make the baking so unique if it doesnt have that measurement	To convert it to a different measurement can be easier because of the two measurements	5.0
To convert it to a different measurement can be easier because of the two measurements	Like this improper fraction could be in cups or ounces like the fractions and can convert it because it would be equivalent	5.0
I think somebody else does too Barun	I want to disagree because	2.0
Kaya	Wed want to be flexible changing the numbers because if you are adding or subtracting it might be easier to have in different ways	5.0
Wed want to be flexible changing the numbers because if you are adding or subtracting it might be easier to have in different ways	Maybe you need to visualize it if you have it as a mixed number or maybe its easier for you to visualize it as an improper fraction	5.0
Maybe you need to visualize it if you have it as a mixed number or maybe its easier for you to visualize it as an improper fraction	You have to be able to know how to convert them so you can make it easier for yourself	5.0
Read this with me please	On the 10th form ordered pairs graph them enter the coordinate values in context	1.0
Blake what would context clue be	Say for citric acid what can you read about it and you dont know and you have to look in that sentence like around it to see what that means	5.0
Read it with me	Write ordered pairs correctly	1.0
Then the third bullet read that	Answer questions related to the data correctly	1.0
Evy whats the relevance of this	When we are older and using graphs to structures we can make sure its precise	4.0
Pick somebody	Lexy	1.0
Lexy	I agree with you Evy and Id like to add on another way that we could apply to reallife especiSSy when were older	5.0
I agree with you Evy and Id like to add on another way that we could apply to reallife especiSSy when were older	When we were talking about like say youre meeting up with someone somewhere and you give them and they want to know how far is this from here	5.0
When we were talking about like say youre meeting up with someone somewhere and you give them and they want to know how far is this from here	On a map you could come up with the coordinates	5.0
On a map you could come up with the coordinates	Like youre here and then youre trying to get here and you can find out how many miles or steps I think is what they cSSed it in the graphs	5.0
Barun	We discussed that this is not SS of the data because she didnt get it SS because it was supposed to be 17 because the coordinates on the Xaxis and then those would be on the Yaxis	5.0
Why	Because you can see in the track what it is	5.0
Were not working on ours were looking at what Kayas done	I did 5 1 7 3 9 5 11 7 21 8 and I had them right here do I show how I found where they are	1.0
What do you think would that be helpful why or why not	I think that would be helpful because it might show you a pattern in between for how far apart they are	5.0
Are we going to talk about structures right now	No	1.0
It keeps going its extending it but why did you decide to do that Kaya	I decided to do that because it helps you see further maybe further in time	5.0
I decided to do that because it helps you see further maybe further in time	How do you pronounce the name	3.0
Id say Lilith	Liliths age would be 14 while Noahs age would be 10	4.0
Liliths age would be 14 while Noahs age would be 10	It shows you the passage of time where their age is going to be	4.0
Were going to see if we agree with his thinking and see his method	What I said was when Lilith was six Noah was two because if you go to the six and to the line you can see that Noahs age is going to be two because they both meet up at this area	5.0
Where the six is for the Xaxis	Yes	1.0
I like the way you used your graph would that work for other problems do you think	Yes	1.0
One question I want to ask you is is there a reason you didnt extend your line	I forgot	1.0
Can you see why were going to extend it	Because theyre growing	5.0
Pick somebody to give you a question thatll help you	Rodie	1.0
Rodie	How old was Noah when Lilith was six	3.0
Tell us what youre thinking	I went to six and seven I went between because she was between those I guess then suddenly I went over and I got two so Noah would be two	5.0
Pick somebody thats showing you this Reese	Annah	1.0
Annah	I dont understand how Noah could be two when he was six and six and a half I dont reSSy understand that would work	2.0
I dont understand how Noah could be two when he was six and six and a half I dont reSSy understand that would work	I might have said somebodys name wrong I dont know	4.0
Does that make sense	No	1.0
Lets help Garret here Rodie tell him your question again	How old was Noah when Lilith was six	3.0
Now go across to the Yaxis go there and whats the number on the edge	Two	4.0
Two do you see how to figure out Noahs age	Yes	1.0
Okay so now Lilith is six and a half so wheres six and a half	In between six and seven	4.0
What did you learn from the feedback from Garret	I learned that	1.0
Do you see how when she was six we put our finger here and we move up to the line and then we move forward	Yes	1.0
Its between five and six	So its five and a half	4.0
Do you see how you use this	Yes	1.0
Are you okay	Yes	1.0
Okay is Noah ever going to reach up to Nora	No	1.0
So you guys dont have a new one	Yes	1.0
Did you guys already do Ls	Yes	1.0
Are you ready	Yes	1.0
Bye	May the force be with you	1.0
Way to go everybody say that number	32	4.0
Okay everybody say this	72	4.0
Hudson	Its 72 because if we look at the five five or more you have to round up	5.0
Its 72 because if we look at the five five or more you have to round up	So youre	1.0
What place value do I look at	Im looking at the hundredths place and its a five so you have to round	5.0
Why do you have to round up if its a five	Oh	1.0
Oh	I was looking at the tenths place and then if you look to the hundredths place you know that you have to round up because five or more	5.0
So anything coupling in between you round up to the next place value	I knew that you would round off the one in the tenths place will become a two so it will be 72	5.0
Round	882186 to the nearest hundredths	4.0
You read this one with me	98137 to the nearest thousandths	4.0
Lets read that rounded number now	9814	4.0
Roge	The purpose of doing this is if you had to estimate something you could round that up to make an estimate	4.0
You know the meaning of rounding up right	Or rounded up	1.0
Why make an estimate Andrea	Because it helps you add or subtract better	5.0
In what ways	Because they could be equivalent	5.0
What do you mean	Like it couldnt be easier because itd be closer to a number	5.0
Vicki	Probably to	1.0
You guys will help Mr Oliver today right	Yes	1.0
What is a unit fraction Charlie	A unit fraction its a fraction thats got one unit	4.0

Real quickly	I can discuss and apply strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers	1.0
What does a strategy mean Asher	A strategy like a way of doing things	4.0
Is it going to be a mixed number	No	1.0
Did you finish your math message	Yes	1.0
Whats another strategy Roge	The strategy I used was I would do 5 15 and 5 20	5.0
The strategy I used was I would do 5 15 and 5 20	Since I know my math facts I know that 5 315	5.0
Since I know my math facts I know that 5 315	So thats the strategy I used	5.0
You want to connect to that Margo	I agree with	2.0
I agree with	I would love to add on	2.0
I would love to add on	Kind of like proving the problem backwards in a way	5.0
Kind of like proving the problem backwards in a way	Because you have your number 2 15 and then you getting your answer	5.0
Because you have your number 2 15 and then you getting your answer	You technically multiplying your answer by 15	5.0
You technically multiplying your answer by 15	Here	1.0
Here	Youre just kind of going backwards moving out to the end	4.0
But just showing you two different ways of doing it right	Yes	1.0
Roge would it be the same for both	Me and my partner said it would be the same	4.0
Me and my partner said it would be the same	Because youre doing the same	4.0
Lets have Rebecca go for first	Well I think it would be the same	4.0
Well I think it would be the same	Because multiplying it by 15 is pretty much the same as dividing it by five	5.0
Because multiplying it by 15 is pretty much the same as dividing it by five	Because youre splitting the larger number into five equal groups	5.0
Because youre splitting the larger number into five equal groups	Yes	1.0
Thats why theyre both the inner	Yes	1.0
Now you get a chance to say that	Its the same as saying 15	4.0
Multiplying by 15	by five youre just breaking it into five different parts	4.0
Jodie	because we think it would be because 15  15 would be the same thing as 1 divided by 5  35 would be the same as 3 divided by 5	5.0
Andrew	What we did is we used a unit fraction to find Just to find the regular one and then we did times the numerator so we can see if 35 of 15	5.0
What do you mean by regular one	I mean like when you do the whole number times the unit fraction is kind of like	4.0
Thank you	the whole number	4.0
We want to say you divide the whole number	Divide the denominator of the rule then you take that number and multiply it by the numerator	4.0
Is it always going to be a rule number	No	1.0
Whats it going to be	Its going to be like the thing youre multiplying it by	4.0
Whats the thing that were multiplying by today	Fractions	4.0
Do you see your three fix ups	Yes	1.0
Look at your work and modify as needed	They said multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	2.0
Now read it again	Multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	4.0
Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction and then by the denominator of the fraction	the denominator	4.0
Everybody have the rule written down now	Yes	1.0
Read the directions for A with me	Solve the problem by thinking about 23 of 13	1.0

Now read B	Solve the problem by thinking about 23 as 2 divided by 3	1.0
Solve the problem by thinking about 23 as 2 divided by 3	Show your work	1.0
Were thinking hard	I used the strategy number one	4.0
Thank you	I know that the strategy number one  how to divide and then you have to multiply	5.0
I know that the strategy number one  how to divide and then you have to multiply	First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was	5.0
First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was	Then we have one whole leftover	5.0
Then we have one whole leftover	We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	5.0
We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	5.0
Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	Then I got my answer 8 and 23	5.0
Go again those of us that are  more time can look at it	First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction	5.0
First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction	I was able to split it into four whole groups	5.0
No I dont see how thats four whole groups	If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction	5.0
If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction	You would have three	5.0
I see the three groups as the three columns	Yes	1.0
Theres four in each group of three	Yes and each one of these would be part of	4.0
Can you show us the three groups	This is one group	4.0
Thank you	Two groups and three groups	4.0
Thank you	Then for each group you would have a third with the group as well	4.0
Thats the 13th one	Yes	1.0
Thank you	Then put two of those you would have eight thats eight full  and then two thirds	5.0
Now Marcuss explaining the division part	I used strategy one and divided the whole number by three as the denominator of the fraction	4.0

Okay so on the alligator mouth which decimal is bigger were going to put the alligator mouth facing the 34	Honestly what I learned about fractions  What I learned about fractions is that sometimes throughout the year the smaller number is sometimes the bigger number	5.0
Honestly what I learned about fractions  What I learned about fractions is that sometimes throughout the year the smaller number is sometimes the bigger number	Because just now 34 was bigger than 248	5.0
Because just now 34 was bigger than 248	Smaller it is I guess bigger it is	5.0
If I add a zero there okay so how did we know that this one was bigger	Because of do you want strike that	1.0
No I want you to tell me why	Oh because	1.0
Shes telling us what we should write	Well so I think what we should write is that 34 zero decimal wait how else we say that	4.0
This is thirty four hundred	Oh yes 34hundredths is bigger than 248thousandths because when we wrote down on the grades it showed that there was three rows and	5.0
Oh yes 34hundredths is bigger than 248thousandths because when we wrote down on the grades it showed that there was three rows and	the The second grade that we did was two rows of boxes and a row of tinny boxes but even thought that the second number is bigger the first number was Even though the second number is bigger the 248 is bigger than 34 then in on decimalwise 34 was bigger than 248	4.0
Right so	Thats a lot to write but	1.0
The three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths of 24thousandths	It is bigger than what	3.0

On 56	No its not	1.0
No its not	Yes it is	1.0
Yes it is	Right here	1.0
Right here	Yes it is 56	1.0
Yes it is 56	Its on the bottom of the page	1.0
Its on the bottom of the page	Oh I see it	1.0
In your prompt youre given a point and a vertex and even if they dont tell you what type of form to choose if they give us the vertex lets know that we have to pick the vertex form to start with so if I know my vertex is 2 where do those go in here	H and K	4.0
We could find it but does this vertex form half Yintercept as a plugin value	No	1.0
What do I do with X and Y	Add it to X and Y	4.0
Make sure you rewrite the equation with that A value in there	Does it always have to be this where two equal  Yes	4.0
Are you doing okay	Yes	1.0
Harper do you guys have a question for me over there	Shoot	1.0
All right go and ahead and ask the question	No I got it now	1.0
Any other questions	No maam	1.0
If we know the Xintercepts we should use the	Intercept form	4.0
Jesse	On the test do we get like a paper thing that sets the equation or you know	1.0
No	We have to memorize them	1.0
Yes	How many are there	1.0
How many are there	How many are there	1.0
Well in this case theres really only two	Well like in the whole thing	1.0
Well like in the whole thing	Like the whole unit	1.0
Like the whole unit		1.0
I dont know Id have to look at the likes toolkits you know	Five or six	1.0
The next intercept theyre all synonyms roots zeros Xintercepts all mean the same thing	P and Q are technically just the Xintercepts	4.0
Thats why they say Xintercepts P and Q	When you write the equation on the test if you wrote that one	1.0
Then what do you think were going to do with X and y	Plug them in the equation	4.0
What would you have to do	You unfactor it	4.0
Yes dont be long	I wont be long	1.0
Coaches the answers are up here if you need to check them	Can you plug in the Xintercept if the	4.0
Correct	What is this	1.0
Walk me through what youve got here	Weve plugged in the vertex here to the  then we plugged in the second	4.0
Theres the problem	Do you want to expand it	1.0
4As	Then divide	4.0
Why cant you not do that	Because its connected to the A	5.0
Because its connected to the A	Its part of the A right	2.0
If its 4X plus 3 why cant you say thats 7X	Because	1.0
When Im solving for X I go backwards so I do the adding or subtracting at first then multiplication or division part	Okay thank you	1.0
How is things over here	We are going to need	1.0
How are you guys	I dont know the actual answer	1.0
I dont know the actual answer	What were we asking what is what	3.0
They do look very similar	Whats the difference	3.0
This one has	Okay and	3.0
Im sure it somehow or another	Is there a camera in this one	1.0
How are you feeling	Pretty good	1.0
Are you doing okay	Yes	1.0
Do you have  today	No	1.0
I noticed I havent seen a lot of homework getting done	I do much homework	1.0
What was your grade on the test	Which test	1.0
test	Got a 94	1.0
You did pretty good	Yes	1.0
Are you an A student	I dont think so no	1.0
I dont think so no	say I am	1.0
So if youre an A student you are bale to do A work in on a test	Yes I usually do homework  and I dont understand it or something then I do some homework to help me understand it  something that I understand	1.0
Okay as long as you know its different on the  grade for you	I might  like 5 or something and then I wont be	1.0
Correct because even if you got half the points	It still be 5	1.0
Let me know if you need any help	Yes thank you	1.0
All right ladies and gentlemen lets try to pick up the speed on this if at all possible we want to shoot for being done in about five minutes	Its not a one	4.0
Its not a one	kind of a Y	4.0
kind of a Y	No that is my way	2.0
No that is my way	Everyone else says its a 4	2.0
Everyone else says its a 4	I think it is	2.0
I think it is	Where is the 4	3.0
Where is the 4	Thats a 4	4.0
That looks like a 4 not a Y	Thats a 4	4.0
Come back up here	Were just hanging out for a little break	1.0
Its quiz time	No	1.0
No headphones no phones on you theyre off and off of you	Isolation from my bag	1.0
Yes well I would prefer that it be a team quiz	Yes	1.0
That means we toss the papers into the box and I skipped one out and thats the one I grade for your team	For the whole like	1.0
Flash	Four	4.0
Flash	Two	4.0
They wrote eight on their slate what did they do Stella	I was not listening	1.0
You rounded it to the nearest one rather than the tenths right	Yes	1.0
Good job everybody say that number with me	09	1.0
Say that number with me	27	1.0
Its walked away from him	Theyre always doing that this time of year	1.0
I like how people are looking in their desks	Always hiding	1.0
Great lets say that number	068	1.0
So 72894	This is thousandths	4.0
Great job lets say that number	7289	1.0
What comes after ten thousandths	Hundred thousandths	4.0
Okay does that make sense	Yes	1.0
Great lets say it out loud	8294	1.0
Read this with me please	I will use previously learned strategies to add and subtract decimals to balance a bank statement	1.0
Parker what does previously mean	My partner says its something that its already been done its something that already has happened to me	4.0
Were not talking about balance like in PE where you re balancing on the balanced beam right	Yes	1.0
Major	Balance means what you have of the total of if you re spending something or losing something or gaining something and whats the total you have right now at that moment	4.0
please	I will know I am successful when I can explain what strategy was most efficient to add and subtract decimals	1.0
Its that time of year where we are doing lots of shopping right	So youll lose a ton of money	4.0
When you buy something you get it	When I was little when you spend something	1.0
Thats your perception back when you were a kid	Yes	1.0
Why didnt we use that Bander	Because its not efficient	5.0
Can you model that for us	Yes	1.0
Yes	Where do I set	1.0
Wherever you want	Okay do I just put this under the thing	1.0
Me counting up is a mental strategy but I think it would be helpful for people to see it	Can I show it on the board maybe	1.0
I like the way people turned to look at the Ms Carter	You start with the smaller ones so 1219 and then I did plus 100 and that will get you to	5.0
Thank you I dont know why this thing isnt turning	That would get you to because 191 would get you to the 20s so probably to tens	5.0
That would get you to because 191 would get you to the 20s so probably to tens	Then I added 08 because that would get you to 13 because 82 is 10 so that would get you to 13 wholes	5.0
Then I added 08 because that would get you to 13 because 82 is 10 so that would get you to 13 wholes	Then you need to get to 20 and 137 should lead to 20	5.0
Then you need to get to 20 and 137 should lead to 20	Then you would circle the 7 on things you added	5.0
Then you would circle the 7 on things you added	This and that and so 100807 would be bring the one down eight and seven and you add the decimal point back in so thatll be 781 I think	5.0
Would you have to write all this out	No	1.0
Mental strategies can be used	Should I erase it	1.0
Gabriel let me go back to my original question sorry why do the strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money	Because it shows	1.0
Liola	I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole	2.0
I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole	They just represent because theyre cents	2.0
You want to add to that please	I agree with Liola but also decimal place its actually the same thing because if you have 7325 in money it practically would be the same just not with a thousand	5.0
Sorry I didnt realize you said Bander sorry	I agree and I would also like to add on because when you write because when you say money you say 781 cents because of the decimal	5.0
Parker	Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	5.0
Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	It depends on what it is  the cents and the whole number would be the dollars	5.0
Kimberly	I want to add on to Gabriels There is a hundred cents and a dollar and theres hundredths and a whole number thats why its really similar because its still got the same	5.0
I want to add on to Gabriels There is a hundred cents and a dollar and theres hundredths and a whole number thats why its really similar because its still got the same	Its not like theyre 70 its still the same amount	5.0
Its not like theyre 70 its still the same amount	Theyre still a hundred	5.0
Amber	One cent	4.0
How many of them does it take to make a dollar	A hundred	4.0
Yes and what place value is that in decimals	Hundredths	4.0
Bander	A tenth	4.0
A tenth how many does it take to make a dollar		4.0
Can you guys read that	Yes	1.0
Do you want to come on the front to do it or can you see from here	We can see from here	1.0
Read it with me	Adding and subtracting decimals in the form of money	1.0
Lets read what the description is that were doing	Players take turns adding and subtracting money and ounce	1.0
Players take turns adding and subtracting money and ounce	The player with the most money left at the end of eight rounds wins the game	1.0
Im pink what color are you	Red	1.0
Red	Blue	1.0
Youre going to say that number for me	10515	1.0
Ive heard somebody say this One hundred and five dollars and fifteen cents does that sound right	No	2.0
Sebastian G what did that person do	They put and right when they said one hundred and five because they were thinking like zero before and	5.0
Which two will be together	Me and	1.0
What word could we use instead of less that we are	Subtracting	4.0
Subtraction	Im confused if Im subtracting	3.0
That doesnt make sense right	Because you added a seven	5.0
Because you added a seven	No nine minus seven	2.0
No nine minus seven	You didnt minus that	2.0
You didnt minus that	I cant minus zero from here	2.0
We keep saying about minus	I mean you cant subtract zero from zero	5.0
I mean you cant subtract zero from zero	We have to go over here and subtract one to zero	5.0
We have to go over here and subtract one to zero	Add ten right there and then subtract ten and nine	5.0
Add ten right there and then subtract ten and nine	Then you get ten right there	5.0
They would gather the little popsicle sticks	Yes	1.0
You have to change this 100	Oh right	1.0
Does that make sense	So thats a zero	4.0
youre working with	My turn	1.0
My turn	I need to do some mental math	1.0
You might want to go back on the lines  and look at those journal pages and get those grades up	Can I do my math	1.0
Whichever way  Im coming you want me to  Do you have the real  Such as	You can borrow it	1.0
You can borrow it	I dont need it	1.0
I dont need it	Yes	1.0
the problem	Can you coach me in my math	3.0
Can you coach me in my math	Do you need help	2.0
Yes	Im sorry Im not going to help you with that	1.0
Im sorry Im not going to help you with that	Okay I get it	1.0
Read the directions at the top with me	For each number  write a number model with a letter for the unknown	1.0
For each number  write a number model with a letter for the unknown	Then solve	1.0
Then solve	Show your work on the back of this paper	1.0
Should you put a unit with your answer	Yes	1.0
Can you please answer	My partners talked about how we felt that counting up subtraction was efficient because the counting up strategy because its the most inadequate one  and it doesnt take a lot of time	5.0
My partners talked about how we felt that counting up subtraction was efficient because the counting up strategy because its the most inadequate one  and it doesnt take a lot of time	With US traditional we like  to figure it out	5.0
Brody why are you using that	I think kind of because with some people its not efficient for some people because  some people do it and you still end up with a trouble process to do	5.0
Thank you	Why is that videotaping me	1.0
Why is that videotaping me	Why is that thing videotaping me	1.0
Its videotaping me	Wait what	1.0
Wait what	I thought you said itll go around like on the carpet	1.0
It just swivels like this	I dont see it doing that	1.0
Say good morning	Good morning	1.0
Its so good were reviewing this isnt it	I want to revise my thinking	1.0
What do you want to revise your thinking about	Well I said	1.0
Well I said	Right now I just feel like the lines	1.0
Can you remind me your name	Brady	1.0
Will you stand up and tell us something you heard with you and your partner	My partner said that she thinks that theyre both the same	2.0
Tell me what you mean by the same	They both are the same angle	4.0
They both are the same angle	Although ones smaller but theyre still the same and like the same length with the angle	4.0
Although ones smaller but theyre still the same and like the same length with the angle	Theyre both pointed at the same The degree of that	4.0
Whos lucky number 22	Thats me	1.0
Fern would you tell us think about what Brady just said and you may add on	I agree with him because if you like drew  the angles are the same but not the size	2.0
I agree with him because if you like drew  the angles are the same but not the size	It kind of depends on	1.0
You can go point to it	The size is bigger but not the angle	4.0
We would call that a Do we know the math vocabulary for that	Ray	4.0
The rays are smaller in angle A but what about the angle measurement	Theyre the same	4.0
How do you know	Because  traced them	5.0
Because  traced them	I put angle A and angle B and they were the same	5.0
Would you share something that	I agree with	2.0
Tell your class	I agree with Brady and Fern because theyre both the same size but ones just smaller and ones bigger	2.0
I agree with Brady and Fern because theyre both the same size but ones just smaller and ones bigger	Like Brady said the degree matters too	2.0
Like Brady said the degree matters too	I just draw that right here like Ms Miller told us and I put it against the bigger one	5.0
I just draw that right here like Ms Miller told us and I put it against the bigger one	They go the same way and of the same size but theyre not ones smaller and ones bigger	5.0
They go the same way and of the same size but theyre not ones smaller and ones bigger	What Im hearing you say is when we talk about angles being bigger and smaller were not talking about the length of the ray	5.0
You guys know what this little arrows called	Vertex	4.0
Would you like to add on	I said that on the screen he said that he thought angle B was bigger	2.0
I said that on the screen he said that he thought angle B was bigger	We were supposed to write what we want like if we disagree or agree with her	1.0
Do you think angle B is bigger	No	1.0
No	Well I said I agree because the size of B is bigger but I disagree because the angle is the same size and the same type of angle	2.0
Do you want to add one more thing Michael	Yes so at first I agreed with Fern and Brady and Damian said but now Im  because now I remember that the arrows meaning it goes on forever	2.0
Add on to it Colin	One of the rays has an arrow on it	4.0
One of the rays has an arrow on it	It makes it a ray	4.0
Yes	The arrow right here usually goes out throughout and it doesnt stop	4.0
Thank you for clarifying that	Its on both sides so technically theyre the same length	4.0
Probably well youre right	If B stayed and then A grew it would be the same size as B	5.0
Okay ladies and gentlemen would you please take out your light green fraction circles	How many of them	1.0
Purple wedges	Light purple or dark	1.0
Joshwell do you have your fraction circles	No theres	1.0
Or if you dont have it what would be an option for you of where to look or what to do	Probably at the back desk	1.0
That would be a great strategy wouldnt it	How else does a cube look	1.0
Try them out	Ill go with the light purple	1.0
Try it out	Its light purple	1.0
Do you think they mean like it doesnt have to be purple it could be is there another color thats a whole	I think both wedges are	1.0
I want you to try to fit some wedges into the angle and have it fit perfectly	Cant this angle also be called EDC	4.0
It could be	When	1.0
When	I have this one and that one	1.0
I have this one and that one	I have two of them	1.0
Yes now you can probably use that  to help you with the next one	Okay now I have three	1.0
Do other wedges create  measurement	I have four	4.0
So should you touch anyone elses work when you walk by	No	1.0
Should you look at other peoples work when you walk by	Yes	4.0
Whats our answer now	Three	4.0
Brendan	I think they all are because I tried all of those too when I was trying to figure out how many would fit on the second one but then I realized when we came to the carpet that all of these could be whole wedges so I figured that the orange one was one whole because at first I thought just the whole circle like the red one would be the whole because I thought that on the second one it would be four so I thought it would be the yellow one but then I saw Alyssas when she put 13 on hers and then I revised my thinking and thinking that that was one whole because it fit perfectly on there	5.0
Colin would you like to add on	I was thinking	1.0
Its Jack	No Colin	1.0
Tell your classmates	I respectfully disagree with Brendan because if you look on the other questions it says that how would you put the fourth wedge	2.0
I respectfully disagree with Brendan because if you look on the other questions it says that how would you put the fourth wedge	You cant put four wedges on there because that would be	4.0
You cant put four wedges on there because that would be	Yes you can	2.0
Yes you can	Yes you can	2.0
My friends what I want us to think about is we start	Okay but you cant do all of them	1.0
I just love how your brains are thinking so much about this	I respectfully disagree	2.0
Lets look at this on right now	Excuse me	1.0
I think were supposed to have the light purple	I think light purple is	1.0
Do they mean this one	No I think they mean light purple	1.0
About how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle	Thatd be because you can fit 412	5.0
Thatd be because you can fit 412	Yes you can fit 412	2.0
We could fit 412	I think thats what the fourth wedge	4.0
Yes Alyssa	Before I counted out I knew that four times three equals 12 but so then I counted out and it worked out	5.0
Who would be right	All of them	4.0
All of us	Well actually we dont know	1.0
Why	You have different sized feet	4.0
Lets say Paris walked from C to ETwalked from C to E and Ms Miller walked from C to E	unit so youll get different answers because you guys have different sized feet	5.0
Yes why did we get different answers	Because you used feet she used miles and Paris used kilometers	5.0
Yes my dear	Are we supposed to	1.0
We are	I dont agree because I measured them	2.0
You know a way to measure angles	Yes	1.0
You know a way to measure angles	Yes	1.0
Tell us more	Okay I usually use a box and a circle to tell  because equals are very similar to fraction pieces because they can do the outline	5.0
They sure are theyre similar to fraction pieces	I was measuring it with one of the 112 pieces  Id do	5.0
I was measuring it with one of the 112 pieces  Id do	I was thinking it might be a fortyfive degree angle	5.0
Youre starting to think about degrees of angles and that you know that different fraction pieces are different measures	Yes	1.0
Everybody say rotation	Rotation	1.0
My friends today we will explore the word of say it	Rotation	1.0
We will know that we have it when we practice different kinds of turns because turn is another word for what	Rotation	4.0
Youre going to be doing what	Turn	4.0
And	Rotations	4.0
How many degrees Colin this is where I need you how many degrees are in a circle	360	4.0
Are you facing me right now	Yes	1.0
Now if I was measuring that angle that was a full turn angle or Colin how many degrees	360	4.0
We are turning clockwise which hand goes up	Right	4.0
Go	Oh my God its so hard	1.0
Where should you be facing	That way	4.0
That way	The front	4.0
My friends so far we have turned a whole turn we have turned a halfturn and now we are going to turn a	Quarter	4.0
How did you guess	Because we aint dumb	1.0
Because we aint dumb	Because a quarter is half of	5.0
A quarter Eva was that you	Yes	1.0
Say it again	A quarter is half of a half	4.0
A quarter is half of the half	90 degrees	4.0
Or	90 degrees	4.0
Where should you be facing	The whiteboard	4.0
Another quarter and another quarter counterclockwise and were facing	The whiteboard	4.0
How many quarter turns were in a full turn	Four	4.0
My friends have a seat	Finally	1.0
Go	Describe each angle by the amount of rotations	1.0
Describe each angle by the amount of rotations	Use the words full turn threequarters turn halfturn and quarterturn	1.0
Go	Quarter turn	4.0
Quarter turn	Half turn	2.0
Say it out loud	Half turn	4.0
Half turn	Quarter	2.0
Would you stand up for us so we can hear you	I thought it was a quarter turn based on the rotation of how far the angle was and the reason why I think it is a quarter turn is because if you look it looks like its not a full half turn based on how long it is	5.0
My friends remember our sentence starters on the whiteboard	Alyssa	1.0
Alyssa	I think its a halfturn because if you look at the shape of it if you do that shape again I think its a whole square and I think that would be a whole	5.0
Were going to keep hearing from each other	I think its a quarter turn because it mostly depends on the turn like how much you have to turn	5.0
What did we just do	Quarter turn	4.0
Our answer for number one is what	Quarter turn	4.0
Say your answer out loud	Full turn	4.0
Bryce	I said it was a whole turn because if you look at the very bottom of it it shows a whole circle	5.0
What did that tell you	It told me that it was rotating all the way around	4.0
He did a full turn	Its like that earth thing you were doing isnt it	1.0
Okay	the ones that we	1.0
Go	Because if this was ones the quarter and it went like that	4.0
What place is this	The ones	4.0
Then Ellie what s this one	Tenth	4.0
what s here	The tenths place	4.0
Nate what does the THS signal	at the right of the decimal	4.0
Class what comes next after tenths	Hundredths	4.0
Does this have a nine in the tenths place	Yes	1.0
Is there a seven in the ones place	No	1.0
Where is the seven	In the hundredths	4.0
Is there a one in the hundredths place in this one	No	1.0
What place value is the one in	Ones	4.0
Could you write this on your own board as a reference from your memory	Yes	1.0
If you don t remember it should you maybe get on  Academy and do some place value work or study that	Yes	1.0
Use the mic friends	I did this number because	1.0
What number is that	30 and 568	4.0
You forgot to say what  the place value	Oh thousandths	4.0
Say the whole thing again	30 and 568 thousandths	4.0
Go ahead	And  say tenths is three	5.0
And  say tenths is three	I put a zero because it had to be something next to  so I put a zero	5.0
I put a zero because it had to be something next to  so I put a zero	Then she said tenths	5.0
Then she said tenths	She said put a five in the tenths and then a six in the hundredths and eight in the thousandths	5.0
	I got 200 and 740 thousandths because you said at first a two in the  and then you said a four in the thousandths place	5.0
I got 200 and 740 thousandths because you said at first a two in the  and then you said a four in the thousandths place	There is a two and four and you said the last number is seven in the tenths so I put a seven	5.0
There is a two and four and you said the last number is seven in the tenths so I put a seven	Then you didnt say anything else so I filled in the blanks with zeros	5.0
Thank you	I can solve a question number  by interpreting	1.0
Interpreting	interpreting a drawing that  I cant say it	1.0
What do you think Tayden	I think it means that you guess	4.0
Hannah what do you think	To convince someone	4.0
Phoenix what do you think	Like make or	4.0
Rory	We need to show like make a picture of how much they took and then Yes	4.0
Yes we could show with You mean like words	Yes	1.0
Could we show with numbers	Yes	1.0
whats a number model	A number model is showing what youre adding or subtracting or multiplying	4.0
Boys and girls what do I need to use when I explain	Words	4.0
And that is a continued issue so were going to spend some time with strategies for that today	Youre basically annotating right now	1.0
Yes	For a fraction was it addition	4.0
Pardon	Was it addition	4.0
Well addition doesnt seem	Subtraction	4.0
I was like Doesnt seem as confusing	Subtraction you have to find a common denominator	4.0
Subtraction you have to find a common denominator	For multiplication you dont have to find a common denominator and you can just multiply the denominators	4.0
If youre confused then what can you do	Ask somebody	4.0
Thinking of what we just had on the poster no I dont expect you to be an expert but you can look at that	Thats multiply	4.0
At the neither	It doesnt tell you	4.0
In fact on a test youre going to be taking probably in a week or so before spring break theres a problem almost exactly like this on it	How do you know	1.0
Josiah my question is thinking about what I see here do you see any of the fraction or the subtraction keywords like left difference or remain Josiah	No	1.0
Pardon	No	1.0
Josiah said he didnt see subtraction keywords so tell me why do you think its subtraction	I think its subtraction because its saying what fraction of theSShas glasses	5.0
I think its subtraction because its saying what fraction of theSShas glasses	So that s subtracting I think	5.0
Boys	No	1.0
For zeros	I think its multiplication because of keywords like of and of is a keyword of multiplication	5.0
I think its multiplication because of keywords like of and of is a keyword of multiplication	It s also asking how much glasses of the	5.0
How many	How many glasses girls wear	4.0
How many glasses girls wear	How much glasses	4.0
How many	How many glasses girls wear	4.0
Yes	Well it also says of again	4.0
Amy why multiplication	I think multiplication because it says of and thats one of the keywords for multiplication	5.0
I think multiplication because it says of and thats one of the keywords for multiplication	Then for area you have to multiply	5.0
Whats the formula for area	Width times length	4.0
Ellis whats your thinking	My thinking is I think it s subtraction because it says left over at the end of the problem	5.0
Bryson whats your thinking	I think its multiplication because it says of at the end of the problem	5.0
Lennox what other clue	It says What fraction of the class	4.0
Okay so what about that is a clue	Its a fraction of the	4.0
Sage why are you where youre at	Im in this one because	1.0
Whats this one	The none of them because it says that he planted 25 of the garden its kind of dividing it	5.0
The none of them because it says that he planted 25 of the garden its kind of dividing it	Like you have to figure out the fraction of it like just a fraction	5.0
Are we dividing into equal parts	No	1.0
What do you think	Im at multiplication because its asking what fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce	5.0
Im at multiplication because its asking what fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce	I know its not subtraction because youre not subtracting	5.0
