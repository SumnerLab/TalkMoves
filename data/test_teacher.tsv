	Arina youre right here next to Eric	1.0
Haha	All right ladies and gentlemen open up to your first toolkit	1.0
	We already started working on that	1.0
	The focus right now with your partner is to work through those examples make sure you know how to do those	1.0
	Were going to start with the first few minutes of getting that toolkit finished up	1.0
	If you were not here	1.0
Do you guys have any pencil	This is available in the stand over there so that you can just paste it in	1.0
	sit up	1.0
	Alison do you mind turning that on	1.0
	And Kinsley could you turn on the lamp in the back please	1.0
Im Piper	Hi	1.0
	I asked him that before	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right so youre focusing on the examples working with your partner	1.0
	Coming up with a consensus	1.0
	Do you know the right answer	2.0
	Youre the only one without a partner	1.0
	A who whatty	2.0
It used to be squared what happened	All right Sara Valentina	1.0
What do you	Yes theres two over there	1.0
	One of them  the other ones for the second one	1.0
Its probably easier if you just read them up there  because my handwriting sucks	Theres glue sticks up there	1.0
	have answers already	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Wheres Byrons toolkit	1.0
You found cubic	You know we are two minutes in class right	2.0
I know I came in	A bit disheveled	1.0
The only math class	You got your answers	2.0
I think so	All right	1.0
Ms  can you help me with this problem	You know what you have an excellent source right here	1.0
	He already has the answer	1.0
What	You just cant judge a book by its cover can you	1.0
Yes you just put the	All right for 1A what do you think the answer is for 1A	8.0
This	I heard a couple 3s that would be correct	1.0
	How about the answer for 1B	8.0
Plus or minus two	I like that plus or minus part	5.0
	Yes	1.0
	Plus or minus two	1.0
	How about 2A	8.0
Negative four	Woohoo	1.0
	Negative four and 2B	8.0
0765	Yes	1.0
Can you show how to solve that one Ms	All right	1.0
	I didnt show any work with that guy	1.0
	For this type of a problem weve got to get X equals right because thats what our answer looks like as in X equals	1.0
	If Im going to get an X equals Ive got to move that three and that four	1.0
	Which one am I going to move first the three or the four	8.0
Four	The four and how do I do that	8.0
You cubic it	Yes kind of that	1.0
	There you go fourth root it	1.0
	Were going to take the fourth root of both sides	1.0
	This is a concept well talk a lot about today	1.0
You asked me for help	What does that equal	8.0
X	X	4.0
	Remember that two is implied in this case	1.0
	A square root and a square basically cancel each other out	1.0
	When I have this problem down here so Ive got X  34  24	1.0
	The first thing I need to do is to undo a four	1.0
	Ill just take the fourth root because those two things Just those two things leave me with X  3	1.0
	So the fourth root of this guy you know what that is	8.0
2213363839	Its a nasty thing	1.0
	All right so lets think about this	1.0
	How many times do I multiple two to get to 24	8.0
Four	Four times	8.0
No	2 x 2 is	8.0
Four	Four time two	2.0
Shes just saying 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 what do you get	Times two	8.0
She said times two	Lets see	1.0
	Lets do it this way make it easier	1.0
	What two numbers multiplied is 24	8.0
12 and two	Okay two and 12 and what two numbers multiply to 12	8.0
Six and two	Six and two	4.0
Three and two	and what two numbers multiply	8.0
Three and two	Three and two	4.0
	So if I factor 24 all the way out Ive got 2 x 2 x 2 x 3	1.0
	Do I have any groups of four	2.0
No	Sad face	1.0
	Thats why we do end up with kind of a nasty number but before we go there if I take an even root what do I have to remember	8.0
Plus and minus	The plus and minus thingy right	2.0
	So plus or minus	1.0
	When I go to subtract three from both sides I prefer to put that minus three in the front so that I dont think that its part of this guy and do 24  3 and get 21 and be totally wrong	1.0
	Plus or minus four over the square root of 24	1.0
	Ive got to put that in my calculator twice the plus version and the minus version	1.0
	Hopefully you are now done with our first toolkit	1.0
	All right so what were going to do is in your journal so page 109 of the journal theres a space for notes at the bottom of that page	1.0
	You and your partner work out these six problems together there at the bottom of page 109 in your journal	1.0
	Its just a blank space	1.0
	It says notes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Im just finding a spot for you to dump	1.0
six and 3X over negative  over 6	This little piece of paper from Thursday might help you out if youre stuck	1.0
	If youre not sure what to do look at this little piece of paper our second toolkit that we started on Thursday last week	1.0
On the outside	It is one yes	1.0
No look at that	I know this looks	1.0
4 X B to the seventh power	Are we talking this guy	1.0
	Great	1.0
You just put it over	Did you grab one of those from over other there	1.0
No	Eric use this to help explain  what to do	1.0
	got it right in front of her	1.0
Dude literally look at this thing and then just copy it	All right	1.0
Im not sure if thats right its	Yes theres really not too much  but get the	1.0
Yes	All right answers are up there	1.0
	If youre person number one in your team so like Sara and Eli and Decia survey your other team members and see is there any questions that they have on these six problems	3.0
Yes but this was	Did you get your question and answer	2.0
36	Alison any questions	2.0
	No	2.0
	Chase	2.0
Whyd she say my name	Two and three	2.0
	All right so if you look	1.0
What	With these types of problems you have to be careful	1.0
	What is the 6 on	8.0
The X	Just the X	5.0
Oh my God were stupid	If I wanted positive Ive got to flip it to the other side of the fraction	1.0
	We dont see a fraction but its says if its over one and then were done	1.0
	So once I flipped it I can change it from a negative six to a positive six and Im done	1.0
The problem is that every single one is a different formula which makes it really hard	Three its negative here	1.0
	Put it up there and make it positive	1.0
negative	and its over one so I dont need that one so I got that	1.0
Good luck Nathan	All right Chase	1.0
	Any questions from your group	2.0
No	All right	1.0
We are the smart team	Paul	2.0
	Youre good	2.0
	How about Antonio	2.0
	Questions with your group	2.0
They just couldnt see it that well	Just couldnt see it	2.0
	So you helped them out	2.0
	Eli any questions	2.0
No it was the same thing  answered	All right cool	1.0
	You guys are good	2.0
	Eric	2.0
	You guys	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Were going to press on then	1.0
	Were going to look at the homework	1.0
	Both classes basically had the same average	1.0
	Theirs was 925	1.0
	Yours was 933 so yours was a little better	1.0
	All right	1.0
	In fact your lowest scoring problems were also a little bit higher percentage as theirs and different problems	1.0
	These are the two problems that scored lowest in the other section	1.0
	The idea here this is written in what kind of form	8.0
Rational unrational	Kind of	1.0
	We say what do we have here	8.0
	We have an	8.0
Exponent exponential	Exponent so we call it exponential form	5.0
	If we switch it to a radical form what would I call it	8.0
Rational form	Rational	4.0
	What would I put here	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	What do we call three	8.0
	Whats the vocabulary	8.0
Cubic	Yes it is a cubic but Im looking for generically	1.0
Cubed	what do we call the number right there	8.0
Index	All right what do we call this symbol	8.0
The radical	Radical	4.0
	What do we call the number eight inside	8.0
Number eight	The radicand	1.0
	Its got a D on the end so radicand	1.0
	All right so this is how I could rewrite that	1.0
	Where did our one go	8.0
Its the exponent on the outside	Its the exponent on the eight but we dont need that	5.0
	We dont need to rewrite that	1.0
	All right so can I rewrite eight as something to the power of three	2.0
Yes	Right	2.0
	When we were talking over here about the square root of X2 is X I can start thinking that the cubed root of 23 is 2	1.0
	Another way of thinking about and working through this one	1.0
	Down here weve got a 27 thats to the 13	1.0
	They said it was nine	1.0
	All of that was squared but what should that be	8.0
	Because is 9 X 9 X 9 27	2.0
No	No its 3 x 3 x 3 so thats where the error was in that one	1.0
	Then over to the two that you guys had as the lowest scoring one	1.0
	Person number three raise your hand	2.0
	Not you	1.0
	Youre two	1.0
	All right talk your team through this problem	1.0
	Turn around talk with your team	2.0
	How do you solve this problem	8.0
What flavor is that	All right	1.0
	Was this the strategy	2.0
That is so bad	She asks hoping that this is the strategy	1.0
Yes	Then of course up here where it says to round to two decimal places	1.0
	That says theyre not interested in the exact answer	1.0
	Theyre interested in can I plug it into the calculator and get a final answer	2.0
	When you see this kind of thing you know that youve got to be using the calculator for that	1.0
	All right error analysis here	1.0
	Over here on the left side I have 256 to the 43	1.0
	If Im going to rewrite that as a radical form from exponential to radical what do I put here	8.0
	Whats the index	8.0
	Three	1.0
	Its the denominator of that	1.0
	Then what goes in here	8.0
	256 and whats the exponent that goes on that	8.0
	Four	1.0
	Thats how I would rewrite that	1.0
	They made the mistake here and they put it the other way around	1.0
	X where that mistake was	1.0
	Great any questions on those four	2.0
	Yes sir	2.0
Wait never mind	I know its a little hard to read	1.0
	Its kind of small there	1.0
	All right then	1.0
	Lets open up our journal to page 112	1.0
	Journal 112	1.0
	Person number two of the team	1.0
	Person number two	1.0
Thats me	Just read this essential question to your teammates	2.0
Because if you know the properties	Im hoping youre catching on to this vocabulary	1.0
	If you think youve got it and youre never going to forget it good to go	1.0
	If not you might want to add that to your toolkit since youve got your toolkit sitting there you might want to just kind of get that vocabulary down	1.0
	Also a reminder when we talk about products were specifically talking about	1.0
	Quotient means	8.0
	Dont get confused on that	1.0
	We are going to do all three of the explorations	1.0
	Now those explorations particularly the first one youre going to find that your tool kit from last week is going to be very helpful for you because notice all the property names are here	1.0
	Youve got to identify you got to match those things together but youre also completing what goes in the blank	1.0
	If I have a to the power of negative two that equals one over a	8.0
Squared	Squared right	5.0
	I can think about this guy as if its a fraction and if I flip the A to the other side I can write my A as being positive but remember its supposed to be in the denominator so weve got to have the one on top of it	1.0
	Which property did I just use	8.0
Negative	Negative exponents	5.0
	I match that guy up with that one	1.0
	My answer for A is one over A squared D Just identifying which property I just use	1.0
	You might want to use that little piece of paper that you got last Thursday and match those up	1.0
	When you and your partner agree let me know and Ill start showing the answers	1.0
that stick catch you	Go all the way down	1.0
I dont know dude	Youre working on explorations one two three work through them all	1.0
do it right	Yes	1.0
	Did you ask Cole first	1.0
Like are you	Were simplifying in this case the product	1.0
	What can I do to simplify that	8.0
	So 25	1.0
Like that	Well will that get it into two thirds more simple	2.0
Not really	Not really	4.0
	Now sometimes we got to get more complex before we get simple	1.0
	How can I rewrite this a little simpler	8.0
What was that like	Like x  x gives us 2x  this is totally fine too	1.0
	If I find those two that	1.0
Not even your friend Im like your acquintance	We see the square of the square we know thats three two	1.0
Im not kidding its not your kid	The answers for exploration one and two are on the board just to make you can check your own track	1.0
Alvin is a whole lot further along	How did that happen	1.0
She just	Do you know Im not a bad strategy	1.0
	All right so I dont have	1.0
	How could I rewrite that	8.0
	If I ignore the  and I just look at that how could I rewrite that	8.0
No	Basically going from exponent idea to	1.0
Because if you try to square square root  its too hard	What if I have squared x squared to the third what does that mean to you	8.0
No	No not  because I dont have a fraction  to the what power	8.0
15	Right what did I do	8.0
Whats the cubic root of  25 is five	Now I have  two thirds and then it leads to theWhat happened then I do four	1.0
27 x 5 is  the fourth power	Whats my final answer	8.0
No	Which is	8.0
	Two	2.0
Okay for this one would you do the 98 divided by two	You know we had a couple of different	1.0
I dont know where	What do you think are some options	8.0
It may be 1024	You guys are done	2.0
	Alright	1.0
Could you do the square of four times the square of three because you also square the whole	Alright	1.0
	Answers to explorations two and three are on the board	1.0
	You want to make sure you know how you get those answers how do you get those answers	1.0
One over the 10th power is 4	Youve had a couple of options	1.0
	One is  we could rewrite this as five to the one third power	1.0
	You have that option	1.0
	Then if you hit the math and option	1.0
I got an idea I dont know	All right if you and your partner feel like youre ready to take a quiz on this and youd have 100 then you could take a break and go in the hall by the window	1.0
	I want to make sure you know how to do it	1.0
	Dont leave the room unless you know how to do them	1.0
	Now we need to think about what would be the fourth root of 256	1.0
	Right  Whats the four three two one	1.0
	That was the easy part	1.0
	Does that work	2.0
	Does 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 equals 236	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	All right if youre in here you better be having a conversation with somebody around you or youre going to talk with me	1.0
	What do you need to know how to do	8.0
I dont even know whats the	This	1.0
How would you find  would find the cube	Probably going to put it in your calculator to find out what it is	1.0
You can use calculators on the quiz	Yes	1.0
	But if you have to show your work you got to show how youre applying the different properties to get to that so kind of the idea of being able to write something like this where Im taking the square root of something squared  so if I can rewrite those numbers with that concept in mind Ill be good	1.0
	Anybody in here got questions	2.0
Walk up there if you need	All right guys lets come back in	1.0
	Come on in	1.0
Thank you	All right were in the textbook on page 200	1.0
	Were not taking a quiz today	1.0
Yes but were always rich	All right page 200	1.0
	Theres a heater right next to you if you want to turn it on	1.0
	All right page 200	1.0
	Now none of these properties are very sophisticated they just get more complex when we have to pay attention to two and three and 10 different properties to solve	1.0
	There might be different approaches	1.0
	A lot of times theres not just one way of solving these particular problems	1.0
	There is one right answer but theres not necessarily just one way of getting to that answer	1.0
	We have to start to recognize what are some smart things to do	1.0
	For example in this first one the base is seven	1.0
	When my base is the same what can I do to those exponents that gets me to my answer a little bit quicker	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Its about knowing which of these properties is going to move me to the type of answer that I need to find	1.0
	Here if I have power to a power what do I do with the powers	8.0
Multiply	Power to a power I multiply them	5.0
	Then here I have two different bases so I cant do any combining since I have a six and a four	1.0
	The only thing to happen at this step is we just lost the one	1.0
	We didnt need to have the one there	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Dont get confused just because youve got something like this doesnt mean now were going to have it be 1 and 23 as the exponent but then which base would we choose or what would we do	1.0
	Just recognize most of these properties or if I have the same base	8.0
	All right	1.0
	I have the same base as seven here but I dont have the same base here	1.0
	All right then over here Im multiplying and Ive got powers to a power and its a negative guy	1.0
	Notice what happened	1.0
	Since my bases are different but I have a common exponent thats the first step that was first taken and I still have my negative 15	1.0
	Now what happened here	8.0
	We went ahead and multiplied the 4 X 3 because this 5 is outside of the 4 X 3 so I can multiply the 4 X 3 and then since I have a power to a power I can multiply those which just equals 1 and so I end up here	1.0
	Right because Ive got to flip it over to the other side of the fraction bar	1.0
	Now a lot of times Ill see students thatll kind of forget that that one is left behind	1.0
	Remember that any time youre doing this and youre flipping it into the denominator whats left in the numerator is a one	1.0
	All right lets look then at D I have a fraction with a common base and all they did in that first step was identify that theres that implied one on the five	1.0
	What do I do when I have common bases and Im dividing when I have a quotient	8.0
You subtract	I subtract them	5.0
	Weve got to know when do I add	8.0
	When do I multiply	8.0
	So that we do the right thing	1.0
	When do I subtract and I end up with 5	1.0
	Then down here Im looking for step that makes sense and I notice that my exponents are the same so I can move that exponent outside of the parenthesis with still the power to a power here	1.0
	Power to a power but look at what I can do first	1.0
	Ive got a nice number there	1.0
	426 will give me seven	1.0
	My 13 to the 12	1.0
	Ive got power to a power so I multiply those so I end up with 7 and 23	1.0
	Its about starting to be able to see what is the thing thats in common that I could use	1.0
	In this case we have a common base	1.0
	Sometimes we had a common exponent that we could use	1.0
	Its just going to take practice of doing these to really start to grasp hold of them	1.0
	All right so any questions from anybody that were left with any of those examples	2.0
	All right lets go to example two so thats on the next page	1.0
	Example two is talking about using properties of radicals which is what this guide is	1.0
	I gave you this as well last Thursday	1.0
	If Im multiplying inside of a radical I can split it up	1.0
	Or if Im multiplying two radicals I can go the other way and combine them	1.0
	We have the one that was square root of three times the square root of twelve	1.0
	Yes it was the square root	1.0
	So we could multiply the 3 X 12 and take the square root of 36 and come up with six	1.0
	Same property	1.0
	Multiplication and division you know typically they go handinhand so I can do that same sort of thing	1.0
	I can a radical a root of a fraction and split it into two radicals or go the other direction as long as my roots are still the same	1.0
	Looking at the examples theres two examples here	1.0
	The 12 and the 18 can be combined so that Im taking the cube root of 216 which is a nice whole number	1.0
	So 63 equals	8.0
	Whats 23	8.0
Eight	33	8.0
	43	8.0
	53	8.0
	73	8.0
49 x 7	Grab your calculator	1.0
	Whats 73 going to be	8.0
	Say it again	2.0
	All right	1.0
	83	8.0
	93	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Since we are going to be working with a lot of cubes I would suggest that you write that into your toolkit so that you can start recognizing those numbers	1.0
	Certainly eight 27 64 probably 125	1.0
	Those are probably easy for us to grab a hold of	1.0
	Let me give you a couple of minutes	1.0
	Write those down in that second toolkit that were Weve been working with	1.0
	Just so that we kind of start to recognize perfect cubes because wouldnt it be nice to just know that especially if you didnt have a calculator	2.0
	Now if I didnt have a calculator here Id look at 216 and Id go Well I know its divisible by two	1.0
	Then 108 divisible by two and keep going but it sure would be nice if Id recognized that 216 was a perfect cube	1.0
	Got a question	2.0
Do you know if were going to be able to use calculators	I think its going to end up that we have sections that are with calculator and sections without	1.0
	I havent seen the test yet so I dont know how its breaking out but thats really the thought	1.0
	Yes	2.0
the Friday before spring break	No it will be two Fridays	1.0
	Thatll be the second Friday of February	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Im sorry	1.0
	March	1.0
	The second Friday of March is the 13th	1.0
	Friday the 13th	1.0
Okay so that means that were going to be after	Correct	1.0
	We have the end of the third quarter another year of school which is basically	1.0
	Yes the 13th	1.0
	Its always a good idea to keep your multiplechoice section  since the final is going to be easier and the midterm is going to be harder	1.0
	I do have them right here	1.0
	Theyre graded	1.0
	I havent gotten into the grade books yet	1.0
	Probably I might be giving them back tomorrow	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	This quarter	1.0
	Yes this quarter	1.0
	Of course a lot of it builds	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen hopefully youve got those perfect cubes	1.0
	Lets look at example B here	1.0
	Wed looked at the one that had multiplication	1.0
	This is the one with division	1.0
	The quotient property here if I notice that theyre both fourth roots I can combine them	1.0
	Lo and behold 80 5 is a nice number and  16 gives me 2	1.0
	Now this is an important little guy right here	1.0
	Lets have the hallway partner read this and then the window partner then the hallway then the window then the hallway	1.0
	Just alternate through	1.0
	Read each of these lines here	1.0
	You dont need one of this	1.0
No	All right	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What you just read those three bullets there are also on this piece of paper	1.0
	Youll notice theres three bullets	1.0
	They look just like those three up there	1.0
	Youre going to see this type of prompt a lot	1.0
	Put this expression in simplest form	1.0
	No radicands have perfect nth powers of factors other than one	1.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	Radicand would be whats under the radical	1.0
	Thats the radicand	1.0
	In this case that would not be the simplest from because there is a squared power thats a factor of eight	1.0
	How could I rewrite eight	8.0
	2x4	1.0
	The 4 is 22	1.0
	My  8 has an nth power as a factor	1.0
	It has a square power	1.0
	Thats what this one means	1.0
	If Im taking a square root then something inside in here is going to be squared	1.0
	This would not be my final answer	1.0
	I would have to take it one more step	1.0
	These two cancel each other out and my final answer in this case would be here	1.0
	The next one	1.0
	No radicand contains fractions	1.0
	I cant have  38	1.0
	Theres a fraction in there over two square roots of two	1.0
	No radicals appear in the denominator	1.0
	An answer like 1 3 is not acceptable	1.0
	You cannot have a radical in the denominator position	1.0
How would you	Thank you very much once again	1.0
	Thats called rationalizing the denominator right there	1.0
	Look at the bold title here	1.0
	It says Rationalizing the Denominator	1.0
	That example is actually the same as example B in the textbook	1.0
	Let me walk through how to do that	1.0
	First what Ive just drawn a box around what does that equal	8.0
One	One	4.0
	Ive got the same thing in the numerator and the same thing in the denominator so it equals one	1.0
	If I take a number and multiply it by one have I changed that number	2.0
No	No	4.0
	What if I multiply it by 10 over 10	1.0
	Have I changed the number	2.0
No	No its a different form but the value hasnt changed	5.0
	Its the same value	1.0
	Its just a different form of it	1.0
	I can multiply anything times one and I havent changed it	1.0
	I just changed the form of it so that I can get rid of a radical	1.0
	Then the question is in this particular case why was this what was chosen to be the form of one that I used	9.0
	Notice I ended up without a radical in the denominator when I did this and that was the goal	1.0
	What root am I taking here	8.0
	How can I rewrite A	8.0
	A is two to the what power	8.0
	I need two more so that when I take the fifth root of it Ive got the fifth root of two to the fifth which will just equal to two	1.0
	Looking back this is what were starting with	1.0
	Thats my prompt	1.0
	I look at it well I do have a root in common but seven eighths is never going to reduce so I need to do something different	1.0
	Notice that I just rewritten it here and Im trying to figure out what form of one am I going to use	1.0
	This guy right here is the fifth root of two to the fifth	1.0
	2x2x2x2x2 will equal the 32 over here	1.0
	I like this because that gives me the two and I no longer have a radical on the denominator	1.0
	Ive got two to the third Im taking a fifth root	1.0
	I need two more twos	1.0
	Thats what Im choosing to multiply this by	1.0
	Whatever I decide needs to go here so that when I work with that I get something thats not a radical I then just copy it up here	1.0
	This is always what Im picking and the other thing just goes up on top to make it a one	1.0
	Thats whats called rationalizing the denominator and thats what that little slip of paper walks you through	1.0
	Notice in the paper theres the green that shows this particular prop does have a radical in the denominator so weve got to get rid of that	1.0
	Then the circle in blue is the form of one that were using to multiply it by	1.0
	Any questions on that	2.0
	Just this one	1.0
	Its going to take some practice to get used to	1.0
	Here is a different one example four	1.0
	Example four the prompt once again its saying we need something in simplest form	1.0
	I look at those three bullets so that I know what simplest form means	1.0
	The one problem I have is that radical thats in the denominator so that  3 is a problem	1.0
	Notice my form of one that Im choosing to multiply by simply changed the sign	1.0
	What does that remind you of	8.0
	The difference of two	8.0
Squares	We just had a test that talks about the difference of two squares	5.0
	We were mostly going from this and factoring to this	1.0
	Now were just doing the reverse because what happened	8.0
	When I multiply those two binomials two terms here two terms here two binomials	1.0
	When I multiply those two together what do I get	8.0
	I get a 5 3 and when I multiply those two together I get a	8.0
	What happens when I combine those two	8.0
	They go away	1.0
	Thats why we dont have three terms combining with those and having a term in the middle	1.0
	Thats how we can use the difference of two squares	1.0
	If in the denominator I have a radical where Im either adding or subtracting Im just going to change that middle sign for my form of one that I use	1.0
	Then I have to go through this simplification process and Ill end up without a radical in the denominator	1.0
	Whats  32 equal	8.0
Three	Three so 253 and thats where the 22 comes from	5.0
	Two different examples there of how to rationalize the denominator	1.0
	Questions on this one	2.0
Can we do another one	We will have some practice hopefully before you leave	1.0
	When we move to the practice you can target in on that and start there	1.0
	Adding and subtracting	1.0
	Weve talked about multiplying and dividing radicals	1.0
	Now were adding and subtracting	1.0
	The only way I can combine these is because I have a common fourth root that Im taking	1.0
	Im taking  10	1.0
	I have one of them here and I have seven of them here that means I have eight of these	1.0
	In other words I can think about this as if its x 7x and I have 8xs	1.0
	Only now my x is actually the fourth root	1.0
	Then here its in exponent form but Ive got 2 of them here and Im adding 10 more so Ive got a total of 12 of them	1.0
	Its nothing more than 2x10x	1.0
	Here its a little bit different	1.0
	Right here theres not an obvious combination like I saw here but I can rewrite this guy as 27x2	1.0
	We saw that 27 is one of our perfect cubes so the 3 comes out and Im then left with 3 square roots of 2 as a common element	1.0
	I may have to modify something here before I see that I have some like terms that I can combine	1.0
	Again this is like 3x1x and so the 31 is there	1.0
	Pretty much like Eli was asking it takes practice on this	1.0
	When we get to example six theres not really anything new	1.0
	Oh actually there is a little something new	1.0
	Ill have to explain this	1.0
	When were working with radicals if were taking an odd root a cube root a fifth root seventh root that thing I dont have to worry about any particular change that the even one is calling for	1.0
	In other words when Im taking an even root square root fourth root and so on my answer Im going to specify as being a positive value	1.0
	For example if Im taking the  3 to the 4th my answer is the positive answer	1.0
	Thats one little tricky part to come into play and in this example right here where Im picking an even root I split my fraction rewrite this as something to the fourth power	1.0
	Instead of writing y to the eighth Im looking for how can I rewrite that as something to a fourth power so that I know what I can factor out and notice what happens in the numerator there	1.0
	All of these examples are here	1.0
	Example seven and eight are just combination packages here so having to apply more than one thing	1.0
	What were going to do for this last half hour is go back into the journal and were going to the extra practice	1.0
	While we want to finish all of the extra practice thats in the journal if theres certain types of problems you want to start with dont feel like you have to start on problem number one	1.0
	Youre looking for fourpoint two the extra practice and anybody got the page number yet	1.0
One sixteen	One sixteen did you say	1.0
	One thirteen	1.0
Fifteen	Fifteen	1.0
	All right it starts in the middle of page 115	1.0
	Page 115 so thats how were going to finish our class with these extra practices	1.0
	I will have the answer key on the board	1.0
	Okay so  over 384	1.0
	How can you	1.0
	We need to factor 384	1.0
	Did you get the final factoring of it	2.0
	All right so 2x192 and 2x96 then 2x48	1.0
	2x2x2 thats 8x2x3 right	2.0
	8x6 can be 48	1.0
	One two three four five six seven	1.0
	I can write this its  of two to the seventh  three	1.0
	Thats just a matter of factoring	1.0
	You know you can get this far right	2.0
	I just broke it up	1.0
	I cant have a square root here but I know theres a relationship between three and nine	1.0
	Im having the third root of 32	1.0
	In order for this to get rid of the radical what would I have to multiply that by	8.0
	Three because then thats going to give me 3 33 will end up 3 in the denominator	1.0
	So Im rationalizing	1.0
Im going to just go  10x	Ms SaundersThe area of it would be	1.0
Yes	Did you check your answers yet	2.0
Yes	Youve got to look at four to get so youll do	1.0
Can I do it	Itll be on my desk then	1.0
Okay thank you	Guys weve got the level four for you to do	1.0
I just got 40x	We need to get you to level four	1.0
Yes but then wouldnt you have to multiply that to the 14 power	What happened here	8.0
	Ivan you need to be working on your toolkit	1.0
	Weve got three toolkits online	1.0
	I printed this for the third one	1.0
	Did you finish the extra practice	2.0
I thought we only had Just kidding were not done at 215	All right	1.0
	My friends were going to start out with just getting our math brains warmed up today with mental math	1.0
	Does everybody have a whiteboard a marker and a way to erase	1.0
Yes	All right Im going to show you a decimal	1.0
	Id like you to write it in expanded form	1.0
	When you think about expand does your brain go that means Im going to  stretch it out into the different parts of the number right	2.0
	Okay here we go	1.0
	Lets read this decimal together	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Fortyone and eight tens	All right	1.0
	Please write that in expanded form	1.0
	After we do one I know you will say Oh yes	1.0
	All right think about what would the 40 look like the one and the eight tens	1.0
	Now another thing that I asked my classes to do that might be similar or different to Miss Kay is I say three two one show and you show me your whiteboard so that I can get a sense of the thinking that you have on your whiteboard	1.0
	Is that the same thing	2.0
	Okay ready	2.0
	Three two one show	1.0
	Just to make sure my friends because I have old eyes make sure I can see your decimal	1.0
	If you have a decimal dont make it so tiny that its just like  I need to be able to see it from across the room	1.0
	Ross will you share with us what you have on your board please and hold it up so we can see it	8.0
	Talk us through it	8.0
I started with forty and then I added a one and then I added eight tens	Hold it up so we can see it please	1.0
	My friends Id like for you to show a hand signal	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Hands down	1.0
	All right well do a couple more to get our brains warmed up	1.0
	Lets read this decimal together	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Fifty and thirteen hundreds	Awesome	1.0
	Now thinking show me in expanded form	1.0
	This time Im behind you	1.0
	When you hold up your board Ill see it back here	1.0
	Three two one show	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Jayden would you keep yours up high and share your thinking	8.0
Then for tens I put a decimal point and one and then for hundreds I did a decimal point a zero and a three	Okay Id like to see your hand signals please	1.0
	Fifty whole plus onetenth plus three hundreds	1.0
	Three claps for Jayden	1.0
	Thanks	1.0
	Who also I need to give three claps to Ross	2.0
Yes	Lets do four since I forgot	1.0
	Four claps for Ross	1.0
	Thank you friends	1.0
	Lets challenge our brain just a little bit	1.0
	More challenging	1.0
	Lets say it	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Zero and seventy one hundreds	Okay go	1.0
	All right Im over here at Miss Kays desk	1.0
	Youll show me your whiteboard this way please	1.0
	Three two one and show	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Ella may I borrow your board	1.0
	Ella would you share with us what you have	8.0
	Here it comes tadah	1.0
	Go ahead and tell us your thinking	1.0
I did seven	How would you say this seven	8.0
Seven tens plus one hundreds	Hand signals please	1.0
	Sophia do you have a hand signal for me	2.0
	Thank you my dear	1.0
	All right yeehaw for Ella	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Yeehaw	Thanks for sharing	1.0
	Well do one more	1.0
	Hey before we write lets read it	1.0
	Eyes on the screen	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Nine hundred six and forty five thousands	Excellent job	1.0
	Please write that in expanded form	1.0
	So you want to think about how much is each digit worth	1.0
	Please show me your whiteboard	1.0
	Three two one and show	1.0
	Awesome job thank you	1.0
	Emily may I borrow yours please	1.0
	Would you please share your thinking	8.0
	Get your hand signals ready fifth graders	1.0
	I did 900 plus six plus fourtens plus fivethousands because that equals 906 45 thousands	1.0
	Let me see your hand signals fifth graders	1.0
	She missed something in what she said	1.0
	Oh	1.0
Yes the end	Well lets think about how we could say it in a way that helps us add to our thinking	1.0
	Emily do you want to call in someone to help you	2.0
My thinking is different by this something that you accidentally said four tens when it was four hundreds	Sometimes that happens when you share out loud in front of people	1.0
	That happens to me all the time	1.0
	So it would be 900 plus six plus four	1.0
	How would we say this part	8.0
	Four hundreds and five thousands	1.0
	That makes sense hun	2.0
Yes	Two claps ready	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right friends please raise your boards	1.0
	When we get to were going to move on to our actual lesson for today	1.0
	Today were going to be looking at fraction of problems	1.0
	Were connecting to some parts of fractions that we already know	1.0
	Lets read our learning intentions for today	1.0
	Our learning target	1.0
	It starts with I can and I want to hear all of your voices	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication on fractions by whole numbers	As we move through our lesson today by the end of our lesson you will know youre successful by solving problem four	1.0
	It is a fraction of problem	1.0
	You will solve it by yourself so that Miss Kay and I can see your thinking	1.0
	We have a key vocabulary today thats going to help us	1.0
	On your whiteboard right now please write the words unit fraction	1.0
	Unit fraction might be something youve heard of before	1.0
	It might not be something youve heard of before	1.0
	We have a definition up here but I want us to come up with A fifthgrade definition or definition in our own words	1.0
	Id like you to read up there what is a unit fraction	1.0
	You see some pictures or some models of a unit fraction	1.0
	Then Id like you to write down in your own words what do you think a unit fractions is	8.0
	Take a minute or so to write down what is a unit fraction in your own words	1.0
	There is a definition up there theres also some pictures some models to show you what a unit function is but we need a fifthgrade definition	1.0
	We need a definition that fifth graders will understand because well be using this vocabulary in our math lesson today	1.0
	We need to know in our own words what is a unit fraction	8.0
	The picture is really what helps me understand that the picture model	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen were going to practice using some of our mouth talk sentences	1.0
	Youre going to partner up with someone sitting close to you do you have perfect partners Miss Kay	2.0
Yes	Who do you partner with	2.0
	Would you please show me now by turning your bodies so that I can see who youre talking to	1.0
	I love Jayden could you turn and join the lady sitting behind you please and Id like for the person with that lighter colored hair to be the first person to talk	1.0
	I want you to try to use some of this vocabulary like my thinking is similar except I wrote or Id like to add on to what you wrote	1.0
	Lighter hair youre talking first	1.0
	Im going to give you one minute with you and your partners to try to come to a similar understanding of what is a unit fraction go	1.0
	You two	1.0
Yes but they all have different denominators	Both of your ideas together and then come up with one definition that you both agree on	1.0
	Commercial break	1.0
	Remember thats one of  things commercial break just means quick pause	1.0
	In our commercial right now what Id like you to do is take words from one persons definition words from another combine them so that you both agree on one good solid definition	1.0
	What do we think a unit faction is	8.0
	Be ready to share	1.0
	Back to your talking and thinking	1.0
	Go	2.0
Because the numerator is always one does that mean none of these fractions could ever be equivalent	A fraction where the  is one and the denominator is different	1.0
	What word can you change here instead of just doing different what word can we use here	8.0
	The denominator is the	8.0
Is the number of	Samples	2.0
Yes	Tell me more about the	8.0
The whole fraction	The number of	8.0
The number	Of pieces in the whole	2.0
Yes	Thank you	1.0
	Would you please turn your eyes and ears back to the screen	1.0
	No please dont erase yet thank you for asking	1.0
	Mia may I have you come up and stand up front and share is it okay if I have you we put your bottom definition up	2.0
Basically in a unit fraction the numerator should be a one and the denominator is going to be the amount of pieces drawn or shown in the denominator	I heard you say usually in a unit fraction one is usually the numerator	5.0
	What do we think about that	3.0
	In a unit fraction one is usually the numerator	1.0
	Hand signals please	1.0
	calling someone	2.0
	Its okay but I just want to make it clear to our class that a unit fraction always has one as the what	8.0
Numerator	And whats the denominator in the unit fraction	8.0
Any number	But it shows the	8.0
Pieces that are in the whole	The pieces that are in the whole	5.0
	Now you may erase your board and now you may head back to your seats	1.0
	Please keep your whiteboard and marker on top of your desk	1.0
	Wait I showed you how many of these fifth graders I told you this is why I like coming into fifth grade classroom because you show youre ready	1.0
	Id like to look at Brendans desk right now	1.0
	Jaydens desk I still look like youd have a whiteboard and a marker	1.0
	Were going to do a couple of practice problems before we jump right into our master law	1.0
	All right would you please show me on your board one fifth of 15	1.0
	Id like you to write that	1.0
	One fifth of 15	1.0
	My friends think about we just went over the definition of unit fraction	1.0
	Do you see a unit fraction	2.0
	Say the unit fraction	4.0
One fifteenth	Lets try that again	1.0
	The unit fraction is always when we have a one as the numerator and the denominator is the number of pieces correct	2.0
Yes	What is the unit fraction in this problem	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
One fifth	One fifth is the unit fraction	5.0
	One fifth of 15	1.0
	What is this asking	8.0
	I dont want to know the answer	1.0
	I want to know what is this asking	1.0
	High five your shoulder partner	1.0
	That means you have to look at your shoulder partner	1.0
	You might even have to say good morning to your shoulder partner	1.0
	What is this problem asking	8.0
	Talk to you shoulder partner	2.0
	What is it asking	8.0
Basically 15 divided by five	say 15 divided by five	5.0
	How did you know that	9.0
	How did you know that Jayden	9.0
	Could you draw it	8.0
	Please bring your conversations to a close	1.0
	Id like to just ask is there someone willing to share what is this problem asking us to do	8.0
	Emma	1.0
	Im going have you turn around and face your classmates and then I want classmates to remember when someones speaking what should we do doing	1.0
Listening	Listening because our job in math is to listen for understanding	1.0
	Emma sharing right now is to see if you understand the same way she does okay	2.0
	Go	2.0
The fraction  asking what is one fifth of 15	What is that asking us to do	8.0
Asking us to figure out what is one fifth of 15 and what number it is	Excellent	1.0
	Would you call you on someone else please to continue our conversation	2.0
I might  more except that I think that it may be how much of a fifth would go into 15	I think were on the right track	1.0
	It might help if we show it	1.0
	On your whiteboard right now solve this problem but I also want you to show me how do you know youre right with a picture or an equation or another way that shows youre thinking it on the board okay	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Sophia I want to see this on your board too because when I can see what kids are thinking on their board it helps me with my teaching	1.0
	Its for me	1.0
	It helps me know what I need to teach next okay	2.0
	I want you to bring the answer and show me how you know	1.0
	You might show with a number model you might show with a picture you might show with a different way	1.0
	how would you show one fifth or how would you break them into five groups	8.0
	Thats what I would do first is just draw out five dots I mean sorry 15	1.0
	How would you prove this is right	8.0
and five times three equals 15	It is right but how do you know its right	9.0
	Would you be willing to share that on the board	2.0
	Okay hang on	1.0
	I like this	1.0
	Tell me more about this	1.0
I drew this because of one fifth and I did  and then Im going to shade it and then Im just going to	Each one of these is  one fifth	5.0
	Will you be willing to share that on the board	2.0
	Would you be willing to share that  on the board	2.0
	Would you be willing to share that on the board	2.0
	Jayden you go up and draw yours	8.0
	Liam go up and find a different place on the board to show your thinking	1.0
	I want you to go up and draw on another place on the board your thinking	1.0
	My friends at desks would you please give me a high five	1.0
	Avery would you find a place up there	1.0
	High five	1.0
	At your table groups right now would you please do a round robin	1.0
	Thats where each person shares their thinking and then stand up when your whole team has shared their thinking	1.0
	That means youre looking at your team mates right now	1.0
	If you have a team mate thats missing dont worry theyll be back in a minute	1.0
	Team mate one youre starting	1.0
	Share your thinking	8.0
	If team mate one is gone you go to team mate number two share your thinking	8.0
	Stand up when your whole team has share	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Put one here	1.0
	My friends up here Ill take your markers when youre done please thank you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I should be seeing teams standing up	1.0
	If your whole team is done sharing please stand up	2.0
	Ladies and gentlemen if everyone can please stand and Id like you to please come back to the carpet with your white board	1.0
	Sit in your assigned spot	1.0
	Avery do you have a marker	1.0
	Did you already give it back to me	1.0
	I do think I might be missing one marker	1.0
	Jayden	1.0
	Thank you my dear	1.0
	Jayden would you stay standing for me	1.0
	Im so excited fifth graders to show you all this different thinking because I will tell you there are so many ways to think about fraction of problems	1.0
	What way I think about it might be different than how some of you think about it	1.0
	Jayden would you start as our first teacher to share how did you think about what is one fifth of 15	9.0
Each row here is one fifth  is also three and the whole represents 15	Fifth graders I would like for you to use our math language chart and talk to Jayden about how he thought	3.0
	Jayden call on someone	2.0
He explained it very well	Was your thinking similar	3.0
Then if you break that into a mixed number it will just be three wholes	Please give Jayden a golf clap	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Who else	2.0
	Ryan your turn next	2.0
	Go on down	1.0
	Because my friends I walked around and I said wow look at how Ryan solved	1.0
	Hey Ryan tell us about your thinking	8.0
So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths	Why	9.0
So I did three on each my fifths	When you said you did you wrote three on each fifth because	9.0
So I wrote threes to represent my answer	So when you say there are five threes in 15 If we think back to our learning intention which was connecting multiplication to fraction of problems	1.0
	Everybody think for a minute	1.0
	Did Ryan connect multiplication to fraction of problems	3.0
	How	3.0
	Call on someone	2.0
Because he knew that three times five is 15	Okay	1.0
	Everybody say thank you Ryan	2.0
Thank you Ryan	All right whos next	2.0
	Avery would you mind going up next	2.0
	So fifth graders I want you to be thinking about look at how there were several different ways to solve one fifth of 15	1.0
There was five one fifth and  five times three equals 15	Questions comments feedback for Avery	3.0
	Like for her to be able to hear from someone that she hasnt heard from yet	1.0
	Someone that hasnt shared yet	1.0
	Ryan weve heard from you	1.0
	No what do you think about how Avery solved Elijah	3.0
She put three into fives	So she knew she had 15 as her total and she divided them into five groups of threes	5.0
	The connection to multiplication is	8.0
Five times three equals 15	Awesome	1.0
	Everybody say were proud of you Avery	2.0
Were proud of you Avery	Whos next	2.0
	I forgot who else I called	1.0
Liam	Liam sorry my friend	1.0
	I liked Liams because it was simple and down to the point	1.0
	But you know what Ill tell you something when I said Liam how did you get your answer	8.0
	I said its right but how did you get it	8.0
Five times three equals 15 and automatically that one fifth of 15 is three	So knowing the connection between multiplication what would you say the connection is between multiplication and unit fraction of problems	8.0
So lets say like this part is	You can use that green marker you can use any expo marker	1.0
If you cant think of something easy then you can go to something	Say congratulations Liam first	2.0
Congratulations Liam	Now my friends  leaving these up today	1.0
	Theyre going to help you heres why	1.0
	If we know that one talk with me ready I want to hear all of your voices	1.0
One fifth of 15 is three	Right	1.0
	Okay going big now	1.0
	What is two fifths of 15	8.0
	And what is let me do this one down here four fifths of 15	8.0
	Okay so you are going to go back to your seats and solve two fifths of 15	1.0
	You shouldnt need to	1.0
	Two fifths of 15	1.0
	Perhaps three fifths of 15  on your whiteboards go	1.0
I cant hear you	Great so as Im walking around Id like to see two fifths of 15 equals	8.0
	Four fifths of 15 equals	8.0
	So if you know one fifth of 15 equals three  whats two fifths three fifths four fifths of 15	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Think about the groups	1.0
	All right please share your thinking with your shoulder partner for two fifths three fifths four fifths go	8.0
	How did you know	9.0
	What is two fifths of 15	8.0
	How did you know	9.0
	Would you be willing to share this	2.0
	Would you be willing to share how you got this	2.0
	Would you be willing to share how you got	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen would you please bring your conversations to a close	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ive asked a couple of students	1.0
	If I have asked you to come down would you please come down to share your thinking	8.0
	Caleb	2.0
	Who else	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Did I give you a marker	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So this is how you would show that youre showing active listening right now	1.0
	Would you put the lid on your marker and face the screen	1.0
	Your classmates are showing you their thinking	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to have you turn your bodies so that you are	1.0
	Show active listening	1.0
	Show active listening	1.0
	Caleb can you tell us your thinking first	8.0
My thinking was lets I had  and I wanted 25 of it and then I would get six apples	How did you get six	8.0
I got six because	Can you use the picture model thats on the screen that Avery wrote	1.0
	We know 15 of 15 is three	1.0
	Could that picture help you	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Tell us how you got six	8.0
	Can I just draw an arrow	1.0
	As soon as I draw an arrow I think it might be a clue	1.0
	So if we have 15 of 15 is there thats here	1.0
	Right	1.0
	This is one group	1.0
	One group 15 of 15 equals	8.0
Three	The second group of dots gets us what	8.0
Six	Does that help	2.0
	You got it	1.0
	Lets do 35	1.0
	we have three	1.0
	15 of 15 is	1.0
	What class	8.0
Three	What is 25 of 15	8.0
Six	Write it	1.0
	I just heard someone go Oh yeah	1.0
	Caleb thank you for showing us that	1.0
	My friends tell Caleb Awesome job	2.0
Awesome job Caleb	Okay	1.0
	Now Caleb showed us 25 and 35 and now we have 45	1.0
first question we get was  the original answer was 3 x 4 because all were doing was find 45 of 15 and I got	Class what do we think	3.0
	Yes	3.0
I agree	Would you please write that over Caleb can you write 12 under There you go	1.0
	That one so that we can see	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	My friends our last question is what is 55 of 15	8.0
	Whole class what is it	8.0
Fifteen	Fifteen	4.0
	Whats the rule	8.0
	What is the rule or pattern	8.0
	That is our big thinking	1.0
	If you can get this What is the rule or pattern it is going to help you with not only todays math lesson but so many more	1.0
	So would you please give these two classmates a big round of applause fort their bravery	1.0
	Ill take your markers	1.0
	Thank you my friends	1.0
	Thank you my friends	1.0
	All right	1.0
	This is talk time	1.0
	What is the rule	8.0
	I have that written right here	1.0
	What is the rule	8.0
	What is the pattern	8.0
	What is the rule or pattern	8.0
	Talk at your teams	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Egg roll	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen please close your conversations	1.0
	Im telling you this rule right now getting our thinking out right now for this rule this is going to help you with all the rest of our problems today	1.0
	I heard it over here actually	1.0
	Liam will you help us start	8.0
	Liam and Jayden	2.0
	Whats our rule	8.0
To multiply by whatever number you need to	So the rule would be Start with this word	1.0
	First what do we need to do	8.0
	Say that Jayden real loud so everyone can hear you	2.0
Find 15 of 15	First find the	8.0
	We call that what	8.0
	Say it class	2.0
Unit fraction	So in this case we have to find what is 15 of 15	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then Liam after that whats the rule that will always work	8.0
	By	8.0
	Multiplied by the	8.0
Number	Its not any number	5.0
	I couldnt do 58	1.0
We have to do	What part of the fraction	8.0
The numerator	The	8.0
Numerator	Numerator	4.0
	Then multiply by the numerator	1.0
	Lets try it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Boards away journals out	1.0
	Were almost there my friends	1.0
	Were just going to do a couple of problems for math today	1.0
	I know but thats just howTteaches and Miss Kay knows that	1.0
	We will all be fine	1.0
	I totally promise	1.0
	Can I see your	1.0
	Avery what page are you on	2.0
	Please turn to 167	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	My friends guess what	2.0
	You just did the math message	1.0
	We already did half the page	1.0
	You just did it on your whiteboard	1.0
	So to make sure that we all have the thinking lets fill out the math message now	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You know this	1.0
	What is 15 of 15	8.0
	I know	1.0
	Thats right	1.0
	Right here 15 of 10	1.0
	You got it	1.0
	What is 15 of 25	8.0
	Good	1.0
	See	2.0
	Youve got this	1.0
	Youve got this	1.0
	Yes	1.0
It just looks different	It just looks different	1.0
	See	2.0
	Youve got this my friends	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Hey because once you know the unit fraction you can multiply to figure out the others	1.0
Plus 12  2 is 24	Commercial break	1.0
	My friends can you please give me a quick high five	1.0
	High fives mean Im going to turn my head Im going to make sure I can see Ms Travers	1.0
	Heres what Id like you to do	1.0
	Id like you to do number three in your journal	1.0
	Im going to give you just about 30 seconds and then were going to talk about number three on the screen	1.0
	Number four is the one Miss Kay and I are checking to check your understanding	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Do number three right now and then well talk together	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Youre going to have to first figure out what is 13	1.0
Yes	So whats 13 of nine	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	So with 34 of 18	1.0
	13 is three so 23 is	8.0
	What is 13 of 24	8.0
Eight	Eight	4.0
Yes	Numbers here are really really hard	1.0
	So 23 of 24 is	8.0
Number two is really hard	Now youre to figure out whats 13 of	8.0
Nothing	Whats your next step	8.0
	You got it	1.0
	I want you to read this question	1.0
	Okay friends	1.0
	Please come back together	1.0
	Brendan will you share with us your thinking here on number three	9.0
On number three	How did you start	8.0
I started with looking at the first two which showed kind of Actually I first looked at what the rule was	Okay	1.0
	The rule is 23 thats not a unit fraction so what was your step	8.0
My step first was to find the unit fraction of each of the numbers and then multiply that by two	I would have to think to myself this is asking 23 but before I can figure out 23 remember our rule	2.0
	Miss Kay is standing by the rule	1.0
	First find the unit fraction So 23 of nine I need to find 13 of nine first	1.0
	So whats onethird of nine Brendan	8.0
Three	One third of nine is three and then we multiply	8.0
By two	by two and get	8.0
Six	So how did that help you here on the 12	8.0
I did and then you put the same thing find out 13 of 12 is 4 so then 4  2 is 8	I love Averys hand signal	1.0
	Yes my dear	2.0
Oh yes 3 2 is 6 so then I would have to do 2  2 and I know thats 4	My friends my job for you right now is just number four	1.0
	Just number four is your math job today	1.0
	Miss Kay and I are coming around	1.0
	Were just going to be doing some checking on how youre doing on number four	1.0
	If you finish four you may do five and six	1.0
	We have about two minutes	1.0
	Is that okay	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Okay friends is the same thing as multiplying	1.0
	I see you sometimes getting confused just because their symbol is different	1.0
	That last problem where there is a multiplication signal thats the same thing as if theres  its the same thing	1.0
	If you look right where my fingers are thats what Miss Kay is talking about of and times are the same thing in fractions	1.0
	There was a little confusion there	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Thats why coteaching is so powerful	1.0
	I know	1.0
	Got it	2.0
	You may move on	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So my friends if you have finished numbers three and four please move on to five and six but Miss Kay and I are coming around to check number four	1.0
Im done	Then you may move on to five and six	1.0
Four times	So the first thing did you figure out what those are	2.0
No	You dont remember	1.0
Because if I did it and youre looking over here its never	I want you notice up here find the unit fraction first	1.0
	So for here I would say what is 14 of eight	8.0
	Because after I tell you 14 of eight then I can multiply that times three to get this	1.0
	Go ahead and continue with five and six	1.0
	And you get	8.0
	and you got	8.0
24	Keep going	1.0
	Always find this first what is 14 of 12	8.0
	Does that help	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Show me where you are	1.0
	How did you get 21 right there	8.0
	Hmm	2.0
Is it wrong too	Its wrong	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Im asking you to share your thoughts	1.0
I got seven and I just multiplied it by three	You got it	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	How did you 15 right here	8.0
Because originally four times five is 20 multiplying five times  all that	Yes	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	Show me Brendan	1.0
	Were you able to finish  here	2.0
Not quite yet	Thats what you can do now	1.0
	How are you doing Caleb	2.0
	A tip	2.0
	To remember	2.0
	Oh I love how you started 14 of eight	1.0
He was yelling	What is 14	8.0
	Youve got it	1.0
	Five times three equals 15	1.0
	Youve got it	1.0
I knew	Sophia show me what you have	1.0
	Feeling good	2.0
	Feeling good	2.0
Is it chicken or is it	So youre writing a  now	2.0
	Number model what turns what	8.0
Not 20 I was telling him that	Do like what we were doing on the screen	1.0
	I dont know	1.0
	What is it asking	8.0
	What  times this	8.0
I would be a snitch	Im not going tell you now	1.0
Well Im not going help you with that one	Think through this	1.0
	Check that one again	1.0
I knew seven times four equals to 28 so I did this 24	Keep going	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	Im going to help you think about this Liam	1.0
	This isnt wrong but you did multiply four times two	1.0
	Its asking you to think about what  of fraction in your number  Number story with a fraction	1.0
	Good job	1.0
what hes saying that you dont need the board	Good job	1.0
	I like how youre going back and revising your thinking	1.0
	Have you finished math boxes	2.0
It doesnt give you the answer really	Okay	1.0
	Fifth graders please give me a high five	1.0
	I just want to say thank you for your time	1.0
	Thank you for practicing all this math language and math talk	1.0
	I enjoyed coming in	1.0
	How would you know your successful today is if you solved number four and youre able to say I know the rule for fraction of problems	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So give yourselves a nice pat on the back	1.0
	You may put your math away and Miss Kay will give you your next direction	1.0
See you	Ms Travers would you like me to stopI said Bye	1.0
	See you on my microphone	1.0
With these  is that what it should look like	Thats not your answer	1.0
	They model up	1.0
	Did you get the xintercept	2.0
	It says solve	1.0
	In other words the values of the variables could make that	1.0
Sorry that got just really anxious	You do not enter the standard form you wont see a square root but you could have a factor that has a square root	1.0
X	You got to think of all four factors together	1.0
	When you look at  Does it look like that	2.0
	The only strategies we have listed right here	1.0
	These four and that one	1.0
	It got to be one of those five strategies	1.0
	If it doesnt then you got to use this	1.0
	So theres three terms	1.0
	Its either this or that	1.0
	You didnt write W2	1.0
	Look at the square	1.0
The last one is going to be the hardest one because its going to have decimals	It is good its time to learn now	1.0
	Pull out the example	1.0
	Theres only three examples in 35 so all the problems are those examples	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	When you have three terms of these theres only one that has got three terms	1.0
	After we are done with the quiz Ill show you how to do what you are asking about	1.0
	Its not quite straightforward	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	All right so the 35 homework thats what youre doing right now basically is like the 35 homework	1.0
	This is all 35 content	1.0
	Now of course 35 you cant do without factoring	1.0
	Its kind of a combination of 34 and 35	1.0
	Obviously how long have we spent on this now so far	1.0
	Think about whats next	1.0
	Whens our test	1.0
Wednesday	Wednesday a shorter period	1.0
	You have to be able to do these kinds of things in about a halfhour	1.0
	In other words youve got to get to the point where you could take this packet and do it in about a halfhour or so	1.0
Why is it on Wednesday and not Tuesday	Maybe	1.0
	Thats just the way the schedule worked out	1.0
	No we got Wednesday	1.0
	Thats why Im trying to get you to see	1.0
	Youve got to know how to do this right away	1.0
	Now what Id like to do we only have about five minutes left so put all of the quizzes together make sure youre turning them in as a team	1.0
	Then Ill probably give you time tomorrow	1.0
	Go ahead and turn them in and then you can leave the books on the desks	1.0
	All right Ill turn mine in	1.0
	If theres a specific type of problem you want to talk about before you leave thats why Im giving us a few minutes if you want any particular questions about any of the examples	1.0
	If you would go ahead and turn off the microphones for me and just leave them where they are	1.0
I cant do it	Ladies and gentlemen none of the team have finished	1.0
	Youre all in the same boat which also means that between now and Wednesday weve got to get infinitely faster at identifying strategies and being able to work it	1.0
	Go ahead and put all of your teams work together so you turn it in together and then put it in the basket	1.0
	However what makes it challenging is it has very different rules than adding and subtracting do	1.0
	As were learning about multiplication we have to put some of those rules some of those things that I would have you guys repeat to me out of our heads	1.0
	In order to help us understand multiplication We understand the difference between adding and subtracting and why the rules change	1.0
	Were going to do a little activity	1.0
	What I need you to do is I need you to take a handful or so out for each partner group and pass it on	1.0
	While this is going around I want you to talk with	1.0
	Theres nobody there	1.0
	I want you to talk What do you know about multiplication as it is	8.0
	If I were to say two times three or two times five what does that mean	8.0
	What are you doing when you multiply go	8.0
	When you do things like I say if you high five the person next to you turn to the area a lot thats what gives you that negative attention	1.0
	Its not funny	1.0
	Its really frustrating because as a teacher what I see is youre defying what Ive asked you to do and making something very simple into a big thing	1.0
	Thats why you keep getting in trouble	1.0
	Then dont do it	1.0
	If you know then dont do it unless youre actually wanting my attention	1.0
	Then we can figure out a different way to get it	1.0
	If you dont want my attention then stop it because youre on your way to your behavior report this time	1.0
	Luis actually Ill put you back because I was talking to you	1.0
	Piper what does it mean when you multiply	8.0
	What does multiplication mean	8.0
	What were you and your partner talking about	8.0
We were talking about how to use it	Tell me what were you talking about	8.0
	Literally What were you talking about	8.0
We were talking about how to use strategies for it	Okay first of all my question was not how to use strategies	1.0
	The question I just asked your friend was telling me the words that you were talking about	1.0
	I dont want a summary	1.0
	I want to know	1.0
	Literally what were the words you were saying to each other	8.0
To use it in different parts	What did you say	2.0
That the part of the multiplication is that youre multiplying first not to add	Its important that were listening to the question and then asking if we dont understand what the question is addressing because I didnt ask how do you multiply	1.0
	I asked what is multiplying	8.0
	Let me give you an example	1.0
	Can I have a couple of Not the whole thing just a couple	1.0
	Here is two orange pieces in here	1.0
	Its three orange pieces	1.0
	Two plus three equals five	1.0
	Adding is when you put two groups together	1.0
	Thats what adding is	1.0
	What is adding	8.0
	Adding is when you put two groups together	1.0
	What is adding	2.0
When you put two groups together	Start with a complete sentence please	1.0
Adding is when you put two groups together	My question that you were supposed to be talking about was what is multiplication	8.0
	I dont want strategies	1.0
	I dont want examples	1.0
	I want to literally know when Im multiplying what am I doing with numbers	8.0
	Bailey	2.0
The number youre	Okay	1.0
	Im doubling	5.0
	What does doubling mean	8.0
	Can you give me more to that	8.0
You double four	My question and maybe somebody can help Bailey out	1.0
	I dont want Joey thats your warning youre gonna get a fine if I see you playing	1.0
	Is what is doubling	8.0
	Literally if I was somebody who didnt know what the word doubling meant	1.0
	I do	1.0
	Technically I understand what you mean Bailey	1.0
	What Im getting at is Im trying to get you guys to be very specific	1.0
	What does it mean when we double	8.0
	Adan Im giving you the same warning	1.0
	If youre playing with him youre going to get the next	1.0
	Reese	2.0
If you take the exact same original group and just	Exact same helps me	5.0
	Now is all multiplication doubling	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Youre on the right track but you only explained one thing	1.0
	Reese whats multiplying	8.0
Multiplying is instead of adding five plus five plus five six times you do five times six	What youre saying then Reese is you are saying that multiplication is adding the same number over and over again	2.0
No	Because you said five plus five plus five six times you would do five times six	1.0
	When Im multiplying Im adding the same number however many times	1.0
	Yes	2.0
Well to add to Reeses five plus five plus five instead of just doing five plus five a whole bunch of times youll Itll be easier to do five times seven or five times 13	If I did five times seven how many times would I need to add five	8.0
Seven times	Seven	4.0
	I love that Daria used that discussion stem without me prompting	1.0
	Adding on to Reese and rephrasing what he said nice job	1.0
	To rephrase both of them and to have you guys Right up here Lucy is a space for you	1.0
	Unless you have a no for being recorded	1.0
I can be recorded	Okay let me ask him on	1.0
	Multiplying is repeated addition of the same number	1.0
	Say it	2.0
Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number	Multiplying repeated same numbers	1.0
	What	2.0
	Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number	1.0
Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number	Piper whats multiplying	2.0
Addition of the same number	Repeated addition	1.0
Repeated addition of the same number	All right	1.0
	In front of you you have some counters	1.0
	You are going to use those counters to represent on chips the problems on the board	1.0
	With your partner youre going to figure out what the answer to those problems are	1.0
	Youre going to be able to explain how did you use the counters to find the answer	8.0
	Once I found Use my counters to find the answer of onefourth of eight I might write that on my whiteboard so I dont forget because Im going to need to use all my counters again for the next one	1.0
	The last one is 15	1.0
	If you dont have 15 counters Ill put them right back here and you can just go grab	1.0
	Lets take about three Lets take three minutes	1.0
	Use the counters Pete	1.0
	I dont want writing	1.0
	I want counters	1.0
	Were not using the whiteboard for anything except for recording my answer	1.0
	Counters are what youre using	1.0
	You do one write it down	1.0
	The next one write it down	1.0
	You have 51 seconds left youre supposed to have done all three and be ready to explain how you used the counters	1.0
	Thats what you were supposed to be doing right now	1.0
	I didnt ask you to solve the problems I asked you to use the counters to solve the problems	1.0
	You figure it out	1.0
	You persevere	1.0
	The first step	1.0
	Find to break these into steps	1.0
	Onefourth of eight	1.0
	How many counters do you think you need to look at	1.0
	Eight okay	1.0
	What does onefourth mean	8.0
	What have we already learned about doing a fraction of a whole	8.0
	Because weve already done this this is a review	1.0
	We actually already did it with pictures I think	1.0
	What does it mean one fourth	8.0
	How many groups do we need to make our eight into	8.0
	How many equal groups	8.0
	We need two groups or four groups	8.0
Two	No	1.0
	Four groups of two	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	On the table	1.0
	I have already split the counters into groups	1.0
	We dont have to deal with counting them	1.0
	Im going to call a group to come up and explain how they found onefourth of eight	1.0
	This is actually all review from the first chapter that we did of math	1.0
	Susannah you and your partner please come on down and share	8.0
	How did you use the counters to find onefourth of eight	8.0
What do I do about the screen	It is on the screen but the counters are on the screen	1.0
	Thats what I want you to use	1.0
	Show us what you did	8.0
What we did is	Not what we did	1.0
	Please dont start with a question word	1.0
	Please just start with we	1.0
	Thats the subject of your sentence	1.0
We did	Not we did	1.0
	Say what like when Im sorry to talk about the grammar piece but boys and girls I see this in your writing	1.0
	I went through that writing yesterday some peoples writing and grammar is a really big issue that interferes with understanding	1.0
	We dont say we did this	1.0
	Thats why we learn subject and	8.0
Predicate	predicate	4.0
	Subject is what Whos the sentence about	1.0
	We	1.0
	Predicate is whats the action	1.0
	You could say we moved	1.0
	We grouped	1.0
	What is the action that you were doing	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Try again	1.0
We times eight by four hence thats the denominator of the fraction	Then we put the multiplication of it then we got 32	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Bree	2.0
	That group have a seat	1.0
	My number one thing is the direction said to use the counters	1.0
	Did you use the counters for that	2.0
We did	How	8.0
	Because my question was how did you use the counters to find the answer	8.0
	Chris you talk	2.0
	Susannah does not need to be the only one talking	1.0
	Shes just the card that I pulled whose group is coming up to talk	1.0
	Youre welcome to talk as well	1.0
We did four groups in	Bree would you like to share your thinking	8.0
	Thank you ladies have a seat	1.0
I think thats wrong	Well he didnt say anything	1.0
Split eight into four groups and each group only has two	Okay make your groups a little closer together	1.0
	We cant see them on the screen	1.0
	Push them to the right a little bit then well see	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Okay now I think that when I said were working with multiplication that confused people	1.0
	Thank you very much Bree you may sit down	1.0
	Because you tried to multiply four times eight	1.0
	But thats not what the question asked	1.0
	The question was onefourth of eight	1.0
	So that means that we have the number eight	1.0
	Eight cubes	1.0
	And we needed to make how many groups Carrie	8.0
	The question was onefourth of eight	1.0
	Where does the two come from	8.0
From here	Four what	8.0
Four groups	Okay because the fraction is onefourth	1.0
	Fractions mean were taking a hole and breaking it into parts	1.0
	In this case ladies and gentlemen our whole was eight	1.0
	Thats our whole	1.0
	Fractions are always part of the whole	1.0
	Now we are breaking these fractions into four equal groups	1.0
	Onefourth	1.0
	whats the numerator class	8.0
Four	Im going to ask the question again	1.0
	Im going to do this to give you time to think	1.0
	Then Im going to point when Im ready for the answer	1.0
	I need all eyes and ears listening	1.0
	Onefourth what is the numerator	8.0
One	Right	1.0
	Youve got to listen to the question	1.0
	One group out of that is I just moved it out of range	1.0
	Is how much	8.0
Onefourth	Onefourth of eight	5.0
	That means one out of four equal groups	1.0
	With your partner the partner wearing the darkest colored shirt paraphrase what I just said	2.0
	Ill repeat it	1.0
	After you know the partner whos talking give me a thumbs up	2.0
	Onefourth of eight means one out of four equal groups	1.0
	Go	2.0
Onefourth of eight means one out of four equal groups	Okay	1.0
	Whats the job of the denominator when youre looking at a fraction of a problem	8.0
	A fraction of a problem means one fourth of eight	1.0
	Whats the denominator tell you as the student trying to figure it out	8.0
	Think	1.0
	Brighter shirt share	2.0
	Go	2.0
	No thats not a big deal	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Other partner whats the job of the numerator	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay five four three two and one	1.0
	Heres a group of 10	1.0
	I want these next two to go by pretty quickly	1.0
	Please make sure that you are listening and showing that you made some changes or are learning from the first group	1.0
	Scarlet and group	2.0
	Please go up there Scarlet and group	2.0
	I dont know why youre standing there	1.0
	I dont know why I have to repeat that	1.0
	Please come and share	8.0
	Sunny you might have to move out of their way	1.0
	No put that down	1.0
	Can we think about what did Shawn and Susannah and Sunny use	1.0
	What did Bree use	3.0
	Yes thank you	1.0
	The question was whats one half of 10	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Here take this and explain	1.0
	Thank you for my active listening thumbs	1.0
	I saw one or two	1.0
	Now that we can hear well see more	1.0
the answer was five tenths	The answer is not five tenths	5.0
	You guys did all of the work right but have an incorrect thinking in the answer	1.0
	My active listening thumbs this is why theyre so important showed me why	1.0
	You guys can have a seat again	1.0
	Guys have a seat	1.0
	I hear that you guys are realizing some mistakes but since the whole class showed me thumbs up it seems to me thats an important I didnt see your thumb	1.0
	Thats an important thing to understand	1.0
	We have one half of 10	1.0
	Now boys and girls weve been doing this for almost 20 minutes now and Id like to remind you that this is work that weve already done this year	1.0
	This is work that should have taken five minutes	1.0
	What it shows me its okay youve forgotten we need to review	1.0
	Im so glad we are but what that shows me is during math lessons you guys need to be really engaged	1.0
	During math boxes where this stuff comes up again when you forget you have to advocate for yourself and ask questions	1.0
	You have to look back in your resources	1.0
	Can we please cap all markers	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	One half of 10	1.0
	They did all the work right	1.0
	Is this a fraction or a whole number	8.0
Whole number	My answer because Im looking for remember you just told me this two means how many equal groups	8.0
	They made two equal groups	1.0
	This one means how many are in one equal group	8.0
	How many counters are in one equal group boys and girls	8.0
Five	Five	4.0
	One half of 10 means five	1.0
	Not five tenths because thats a very different answer	1.0
	These are whole numbers	1.0
	Five tenths would be one object cut into 10 pieces	1.0
	Then five tenths would be half of that	1.0
	Those are two very different answers	1.0
	This is a whole number because Im looking at two equal groups of 10 how many are in one group	8.0
	Im not cutting one thing into pieces	1.0
	Any questions on that	2.0
	That seemed to be a big piece of confusion	1.0
	To be honest with you Im not sure it is because I look at a lot of right answers	1.0
	What I think it is is that you dont really listen when other people talk and when I say active listening thumbs youre just like and you dont have a clue what the person just said	1.0
	Thats the other thing that shows me	1.0
	Okay last one	1.0
	The last one was one fifth of	8.0
		4.0
	Okay	1.0
	Theres 15	1.0
	Im going to leave my mic right here so whoever comes up can use it	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Im going to use my card	1.0
	Luis and partner	2.0
	Julia can you please put those down	1.0
	We dont need the whiteboard but what I need is to not waste a minute getting up there to describe the problem	1.0
	Just go	1.0
	Can you scooch them a little closer to each other so we can see them	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I like that Luis said because Daria can you say why	9.0
	Why are there five groups of three	9.0
	How did you know to make five groups of three	8.0
I know that I need to make five groups of three because I know five times three equals 15 and five goes to three	What other problem helped you know that they needed five groups	8.0
	Olivia	2.0
You multiply the denominator and the whole number	No because if I multiply the denominator 5 times 15 I would get 75	5.0
	Lets listen to my question again please	1.0
	My question was what in that problem told Luis and Daria they needed five equal groups	8.0
	Cooper	2.0
	Okay good	1.0
	The denominator tells us how many groups we need	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Okay keep talking	1.0
	Whats one fifth of 15	8.0
One fifth of 15 is three	Because	9.0
Because	True and what does the one the numerator tell us	8.0
	Right so how many are in that one group	8.0
	How many are in that one group boys and girls	8.0
Three	Three okay	1.0
	All right friends	1.0
	Please turn in your journal actually before you turn in your journal can you please with your partner discuss any learning from this any refreshing of memories you needed	2.0
	If you didnt learn anything new just review whats the denominator tell you whats the numerator tell us	8.0
	Im going to be passing this around for you to put your blocks back into	1.0
	Can you do it in a really quick manner like take a handful put it in were not doing one at a time	1.0
We make three groups of five you take	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Take about 30 seconds please to review that vocabulary I have at the top of the slide because that vocabulary is telling you the words that I want to hear from you as you are talking today	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	One really cool thing Where are all my eyes	1.0
	I see so many backs of heads	1.0
	Yes Im back here	1.0
	Who changed it up	1.0
	Thank you I appreciate that	1.0
	One cool thing about these recordings that Ill show you next time is they make a word cloud	1.0
	What a word cloud is its listening to all the words that I say and you say and then it puts them in a picture and the bigger the word the more option is set	1.0
	If were using our math vocabulary youll see those words on the word cloud	1.0
	Tomorrow we can take a look and see how well we did using our math vocabulary	1.0
Is it always that thing in ABC  where you can get a lot of words	Maybe I have no clue	1.0
	I dont know what that is	1.0
	All right so take 30 seconds right now to read those words that I want to hear today	1.0
	Youre reading them in your head friends	1.0
	Head head head head	1.0
	Thats going to be on my word cloud	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	I said like six times head	1.0
	Now you know that word is going to be in a word cloud because I had to say it six times	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Show me thumbs up when youre done reading	2.0
	The new word that we havent used a lot is a unit fraction	1.0
	We just worked with unit fractions	1.0
	Unit fractions are onefifth onehalf one What was the first one we did	8.0
	Onefourth	1.0
	Think of a unit fraction in your head turn to your partner	1.0
	Whoever talked last zip it and the other person talk first and share your unit fractions	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Waterfall okay	2.0
	Theres a picture of two fractions here	1.0
	Just as we discussed before we started multiplication is repeated addition of the same number	1.0
	If I have onefifth times three which by the way that means onefifth of three it is onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth	1.0
	So the answer is threefifths	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	How could you use knowing this that onefifth times three equals threefifths and thats onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth	8.0
	How could you use that to figure out what is threefifths of 20	8.0
	With your partner Id like you to take a minute or two to try to figure out How can I use this pattern to solve what is threefifths of 20	8.0
	We just spend some time finding the unit fraction we know that multiplication is repeated addition	1.0
	threefifths is onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth what is threefifths of 20	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay so thats not using the pattern	1.0
	Think about what did we do with the unit fractions and all that 35 40 minutes of work we just did	1.0
	Think about how the threefifths means onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth and put that together to find your answer	1.0
	I dont see you working at all Pete	1.0
	I dont see you thinking talking doing anything to try to solve this problem	1.0
	You need to try to solve this problem starting with	1.0
	Are you done	2.0
	Then lets keep going	1.0
	Okay just pass it over here well put it in	1.0
	I didnt say throw I said pass	1.0
	Well okay I can see	1.0
	When I say pass in school its not football	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	We hand it	1.0
	Passing in school is not football	1.0
	All right Mikara	2.0
I dont know	Okay I have an answer	1.0
Why is football pass	I dont have an answer	1.0
	Now moving on to math	1.0
	If you are not finished talking please continue talking Ill give you about 30 more seconds then Im going to use my cards	1.0
	Go	2.0
	By the way Seanna I really liked your thinking	1.0
	The only thing I have to say is whats our numerator	8.0
Five	How many fives do you have there	8.0
	Im going to call a card that persons going to share their thinking	1.0
	If you need to go up to the board and write anything the pen is on my desk	1.0
	If you dont if youre just using words thats fine	1.0
	Then Im going to call another card to share their thinking	1.0
	Okay Seanna what was your thinking	8.0
	How can you use that pattern to solve	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Not what I was thinking	1.0
	Whos the subject	8.0
I was thinking	There you go	1.0
that I could use just the numerators  to try and	Okay	1.0
	Bailey	2.0
I think you can do on design  put it in bits of three	Okay Cooper	2.0
I was thinking that you could do	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	First of all I want to say all of these skills are building on each other	1.0
	The 35 40 minutes we spent finding unit fraction of problems applies to this problem	1.0
	Im going to bring it back to Seanna	2.0
	Where did the five come from	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	The denominator is five	1.0
	What did we just learn that the denominator means when we have a fraction of problem	8.0
	Lets bring it back to our warmup	1.0
	Lets say we have one onefifth of 20 what does the denominator mean	8.0
	What does that denominator tell us	8.0
	We just went over this we spent 35 minutes	1.0
	Tell your partner	2.0
	Im using cards	1.0
	Go	2.0
It tells	No it	1.0
The denominator tells us that how many groups to put it in	Okay perfect	1.0
	Im noticing that three fifths of 20 all right that here	1.0
	What do you notice is different between one fifth of 20 and three fifths of 20	1.0
	Talk to your neighbor go	2.0
	Somebody said top number I already know	1.0
	Okay five four three two and one Carrie whats different	8.0
	I love your awesome math language and I love your complete sentence	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What youre telling me then can we pass that to Carrie	1.0
	What youre telling me then is everything else is the same so that means the same strategy we used for here we could apply for here except one little difference	1.0
	Thats what were seeing	1.0
	Because what I was hearing from my friends who shared Daria was we were taking the strategies you just learned throwing them out the window like weve never learned before in our life and making up some other stuff	1.0
	Im not going to have you do that	1.0
	Math builds on itself	1.0
	Sixth grade is going to build on fifth grade	1.0
	Youre going to use what you learned here this year and add to it	1.0
	Thats how math works	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If the five is how many equal groups what did we say the one the numerator amounts	1.0
	Tell your partner Im using my carts go	2.0
	Red Robin	2.0
Yes	Sean what does the numerator tell us	8.0
How much youre counting in a group	How much youre counting in a group	2.0
	Kind of	1.0
	The numerator tells us how many of the equal groups we need to count	1.0
	If I have five equal groups of 20 how many is going to be in each group	8.0
Four	Four because I know that five times four equals 20	5.0
	Thats our basic math fact	1.0
	We shouldnt need to draw a picture of that but if you need to thats fine	1.0
	One of those groups has four in it	1.0
	Any questions Piper Julia	2.0
	What I liked about Ceanna is she had the five thinking wrong however the rest of her thinking is correct	1.0
	Its the numerator means how many equal groups were going to count how many equal groups are we going to count	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	If one group has four three groups one two three	1.0
	Whats the multiplication problem for that	8.0
	And what does that equal	8.0
	Three fifths of 20 is 12	5.0
	The rules state the same	1.0
	The numerator means how many equal groups	1.0
	The denominator sorry	1.0
	The denominator means how many equal groups	1.0
	The numerator is telling me how many of those groups I need to count so if my numerator is three Im going to count three groups	1.0
	Any questions so far	2.0
	Paraphrase what youve learned and were going to turn and practice with page 167 in the journal go	2.0
	Is this for being off task and not listening when I was teaching	1.0
like how many	Quickly	1.0
	Thats not what I wanted to do	1.0
	Please fill out numbers one and two right now	1.0
	Do it independently and then when both you and your partner are done talk about what patterns you notice	1.0
	Go	1.0
Were on which page	Were on page 100 Oh	1.0
167	Im sorry math journal page 167 is with the SEC so I apologize if I misspoke	1.0
You didnt really want to	I didnt they just didnt listen	1.0
	Got you	1.0
five six but thats a wrong one maybe you just dont want to say it come on	Oh thats page five because thats the wrong lesson	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	I got to fix that	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Go ahead and do number one	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What should I write class youre going to tell me the whole class	8.0
	Tell me what goes here	8.0
Two five three six	Okay	1.0
	Thinking about what we just learned talk with your partner whats the pattern between three fifths and this one	9.0
	Three fifths of 10 is six	1.0
	Whats the pattern what do you notice	9.0
	Thinking about what we just learned	1.0
	Go	2.0
You get it	Hey waterfall	2.0
	Luis can you please share what you noticed	8.0
I noticed that on number one that is first and that on question two is six then 236 and same with 35 is 15 and 33 is 9 36 is 18	Well part of the fraction is telling us to multiply by three	5.0
	Danhew	2.0
The numerator is bigger	Youre telling me to paraphrase Luis and Todd if we find the unit fraction of a number in the denominator we can sorry ignore me what I just said	1.0
	When we find the unit fraction of the number we can multiply that answer by the new numerator to get a fraction of when the numerator is not one	1.0
	Unit fraction remember means one something	1.0
	Lets scroll this down its going to take me a second	1.0
	You guys look at number three in your book while I clear this up	1.0
Should we write it or	And go ahead and complete it	1.0
All right	You can talk with your partner if you need to	1.0
	Think about the patterns that we just completed	1.0
	Bailey what I wanted you to notice is that the numerator is not two so thats four if it was one	1.0
	Sean you better have something down there and I think Bailey was trying to talk to you	1.0
	Bailey put eight	1.0
	Can you tell Sean where that came from	8.0
Six divided by two is three	Waterfall	2.0
Ssh	Waterfall	2.0
Ssh	Better	1.0
	Kylie what should I write and how did you figure that out	8.0
I think you should write 8 for the out because in the denominator of two thirds the three goes into 12 four times and then the numerator 2 you would multiply 42 and that would equal eight	is this for Bailey	1.0
	Joey what do you think of what Melanie said	3.0
	Can you paraphrase Melanie and and tell me what you think our discussion stem I agree disagree or would like to add	2.0
I agree with him because he came through with eight	But how did she get it	3.0
She divided it by three	Divided what by three	3.0
Four and then subtracted whats the she subtracted	She didnt subtract anything friend	1.0
	Please pay attention when your classmates are talking	1.0
	Your eyes should be on them	1.0
	Thats how you pay attention	1.0
	All right Anna tell me about six	8.0
	What should I write and why	9.0
Can I tell her	Friend numerator end I need you to coach dont tell	3.0
	Give her maybe a hint on the first step but dont tell and yes you can	2.0
What to do with both of them	Im going to tweak what Ali said a little bit I love her coaching	1.0
	First you need to look at the denominator because notice what I wrote right here	1.0
	What Melanie explained she first found 13 of 12 first so thats our first step	1.0
	Whats 13 of 6	8.0
	Then we can look at our poster and look at our numerator to think What do I need to do with that two	8.0
	The numerator tells you what Anna	8.0
	Look at the green	1.0
	You tell me what the green says read it for Me	2.0
How many of equal groups do we have	This is how many are in one equal group	1.0
	This says I need to figure out how many are in two equal groups	1.0
	If theres two in one group how many would be in two groups	8.0
Two groups would be a third	Two is in one group how many are in two groups	8.0
Four	Four this is how many are in one because my numerator is one	5.0
	The new numerator tells me I need to figure out how many are in two equal groups	1.0
	Any questions	2.0
	You have a question sir	2.0
	Please complete number four independently not with your partner	1.0
	After you do number four	1.0
	Can you pick it up for me	1.0
	Sit Im almost done	1.0
	I just want to finish writing this last rule	1.0
	If youre finished compare with your neighbor and see if you agree	3.0
	Nos you can talk to other people that are actually here	1.0
	Red Robin	2.0
Yoh	Red Robin	2.0
Yoh	I also need to see eyes	1.0
	Sean I need to see your eyes	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	Luis	1.0
	All write I wrote friends can you move	1.0
	I wrote some step by step steps because I noticed when I said to start some people were just sitting there not able to start	1.0
	I put these steps here to use as a resource	1.0
	Well go through 34 of eight as our example	1.0
	It says to look at the denominator and find how many equal groups	1.0
	Class when I point at me youre going to tell me how many equal groups are we going to make	8.0
	Ready	2.0
Four	Four so if I do four equal groups and eight is my whole number how many are in one group	8.0
	Bree how did you get two	8.0
	Because youre the only one who answered	1.0
	The rest of your eyes need to be here	1.0
	Here answering these questions not one person 26 people	1.0
	How did you get two	8.0
How I got two is by I know that four times two is eight and there is four	Yes thank you Luis for your active listening Luis	1.0
	Another way you could think is eight divided by four equals two either way its the same thing	1.0
	Tell your partner what did Bree do to figure out two	3.0
	How many are in one group	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Five four three two and one my third step is multiply the amount in one group so thats going to be two times my numerator	1.0
	Class when I point to you youre going to tell me my numerator	8.0
	Henry what do you have tell me when I point	8.0
We tell you the denominator	No thats why your eyes should be on me when Im talking	1.0
	Youre going to tell me the numerator	1.0
	What are you going to tell me Henry	8.0
The numerator	When I point whats the numerator	8.0
Three	Two times three equals	8.0
Six	Show me thumbs up if you have six in that first in and out place thumbs down if you did not	2.0
	If you did not please use this learning and quickly fix while I go get my pen	1.0
	Bree can you pass my pen forward	1.0
	Can you excuse me while I walk through	1.0
	I dont have my cards on me so Ill take a volunteer	1.0
	What should I write here Todd	8.0
	Pardon no major savers today friends	1.0
No	Sorry what would I write	8.0
You should write 15	Following my steps whats the denominator	8.0
Four	How many are in one group if I make four groups	8.0
Five	Five times three equals	8.0
	All right volunteer for this one Bree	2.0
	Volunteer for this one Ada	2.0
	Friends if you did not get these numbers now is your time to ask questions	1.0
	I dont know about whats going on here	1.0
	Let me see what are these following questions ask	1.0
	I want you to answer questions number five and six quickly and return to your desk	1.0
	Again youre doing that independently	1.0
	If you are at your desk already will you grab a computer for you and your purple partner	1.0
	Whichever purple partner sits down first gets a computer	1.0
	You may go to our Math Google Classroom	1.0
	All of our answers have been full numbers	1.0
	If I have 12 eggs how many are in one six	8.0
	If I split it into equal groups of six how many would be in one group	8.0
Two	Two yes	5.0
	12 divided by 6 is 2 or 6 times 2 is 12 every way you look at it always two	1.0
	I need you to be paying attention too	1.0
	You were right	2.0
	Ill send him in just a second	1.0
	Hes right here with me	1.0
	I will make sure that I have Luis come get you when we leave for recess	1.0
	How many eggs did she sell for the bread	8.0
	She sold 46 not 16	1.0
	She sold 4 groups of 2	1.0
	You need to take four times two	1.0
	All right boys and girls five Shes sold 46 of Boys and girls the last question that you were asked to do Im going to use over here	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	The last question that you were asked to do was to write a multiplication fact	1.0
	Im going to show you what that multiplication fact is because I didnt actually write that down	1.0
	46 of was it 20 for the eggs that 12	2.0
Yes	46 of twelve is what you were figuring out	1.0
	When you have fraction of problems you take out the word of you stick in a multiplication sign	1.0
	Fraction of means youre multiplying	1.0
	46 times 12 equals what class	8.0
	Class Bree is not the only person in my class	1.0
	Im going to stop talking	1.0
	Ill count my bad that I didnt give you guys some think time	1.0
	Im going to ask the same question	1.0
	Im going to give you some time and Im going to point when I want the answer because only hearing one person tells me you guys still dont understand how to do this	1.0
	Which is not a problem except for the fact that when I stood there and said Who has questions	1.0
	Nobody asked which means you all understood which isnt true	1.0
	My question is if I just replace the word of which is what you have in your book with the multiplication symbol its the same thing	1.0
	14 times 12 equals what	8.0
Eight	Yes six equal groups has two in each group two times four equals eight	5.0
	All right friends	1.0
	You have 45 seconds to get into Google Classroom with that computer youre sharing with your purple partner	1.0
	Its always a good idea to take notes	1.0
	I didnt stop and pause though	1.0
	Dan	2.0
	Time is up friends	1.0
	In Google Classroom it should be the top link or second link in your stream	1.0
	Theres a link	1.0
	Youre going to be playing a fraction of game thats not called Pac Man but thats basically what it is	1.0
	Click the link for me	1.0
	It needs flash so its going to say Click to do Adobe Flash	1.0
	Youre going to click that and then click allow and then youll be able to play the game	1.0
	All eyes on me once you get that part	1.0
	Once youve got the game I know because youre looking at me	1.0
	Partner A is going to be closest to a whiteboard	1.0
	Were going to take turns so one person is going to use the controllers	1.0
	Youre going to use the spacebar to move forward and the arrow bars to move up down sideways	1.0
	Partner A is going to say You need to eat a certain course	1.0
	Lets get out of this	1.0
	Lets go to Google Classroom	1.0
	Thank you for your patience	1.0
	By the way now that this is up here you can play this whenever you want	1.0
	You could add this as some of like homework if you want or Its a game that practices todays lesson	1.0
	At the bottom you see 25 of 10	1.0
	I know that and the ghosts all have numbers on them	1.0
	I think 10 divided by 5 means theres 2 in each group 2 times 2 is 4	1.0
	Im going to head down here and eat ghost number 4	1.0
	Partner A would tell me which ghost to eat so class your partner A tell me which ghost I need to eat now	1.0
	Ghost two	8.0
Three	Really	2.0
	Where does goes one running because ghost is about to eat me	1.0
	Where does two come from	8.0
	Because Ive got seven equal groups and 17 that puts one per group	1.0
	One times three equals three so my friends who said two which was most of the class just showed me that you dont understand how to do this	1.0
	Now 14 of 8 we already did that in our morning work is 2	1.0
	According to the directions here partner A youre going to tell Partner B which group ghost to eat	1.0
	Partner B is going to then control Pac Man	1.0
	Once youve eaten that one ghost you switch roles	1.0
	Its the next persons turn to control and Partner B is now telling them	1.0
	Make sense	2.0
Yes	Were not going to play for 10 minutes	1.0
	This lesson went way over	1.0
	Oh I just died	1.0
	Unfortunately we will still have our party today but we cannot have it now because its lunchtime	1.0
	Just get out of that game	1.0
	Because lunch recess is started and were not allowed to go out for lunch recess	1.0
	This lesson went way long	1.0
	We will have it this afternoon instead	1.0
	Well extend our afternoon recess instead just not ideal	1.0
	The kids will have to stay in for 10 minutes and then come out	1.0
	Were only going to play this for five minutes instead of 10	1.0
	You may go	1.0
	Good job my friend	1.0
	Play with what	1.0
	Edith play with You dont have a partner so come be with Gail	1.0
	Since you guys have two computers Gail you return to your seat and just play independently and then Gail can	1.0
	I passed out to each table a stack of exit slips	1.0
	Please have the partner with the longer hair put the computer away and work on the exit slip and go to independent reading	1.0
	There is no transition timer right now so this all needs to happen with zero voices please	1.0
	Yes thats on	1.0
	Its for a study	1.0
	It records the lesson and gives information about how much I talk versus how much they talk	1.0
	All right I see some disagreements here	1.0
	Taylor why dont you	1.0
	If I look at her work I notice something	1.0
	I see where she went wrong	1.0
	Who can help her notice where she went wrong	3.0
	Coach her	3.0
	Jen	2.0
	Okay true	1.0
	But look at her work because I think her work is where I see something that maybe got her confused	1.0
	Shannon	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right but thats still not where the first mistake happened	1.0
	Lets think back to whats the first step that were supposed to do and what do you notice about Jackies work in that first step	3.0
	Talk to her not me	2.0
	Coach her	3.0
	Jessica	2.0
	Under fix your mistake what is something she did correct with that	3.0
	Because I see some work that was correct	1.0
	Avery	2.0
	Talk to her	2.0
	I disagree	1.0
	What about that arrow	8.0
	Did she do the arrow to the neighbor correctly	3.0
	Okay	1.0
	Jackie whats your next step	8.0
	You underline you look at an arrow then what	8.0
	Nice and clear	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Fix your answer based on what you just said	1.0
	All right I agree	1.0
	What I love about Jackie is that growth mindset and how you guys helped her figure out the mistake and how that shows that very simple step of underlining thank you Jackie the digit that you are rounding to really can make a difference in whether you have the right answer or not	1.0
	Remembering that the only digit that changes is the well not the only digit the digit that youre going to keep the same or go up one is the underlined digit	1.0
	I change it to red hoping that would help us see better	1.0
	Taden second one	8.0
	I see a big mix	1.0
	I see some sideways	1.0
	Why are you sideways Jessica	3.0
	Why dont you use the original problem to show your work	9.0
	Instead of rewriting it you could just use the original	1.0
	Instead of rewriting it you can just use the numbers that are already up there right	2.0
	Could you underline from there	2.0
	I cant hear you	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	What would make his answer even better	3.0
	I agree	1.0
	I would never mark what he wrote down on the test but what would make it even better	3.0
	Todd	2.0
	I agree you could use more	1.0
	Im looking specifically at what he wrote though	1.0
	What could he make better about what he wrote	3.0
	What have I told you about the zeros after the decimal	8.0
	Marianne	2.0
	No I actually have not told you that	1.0
	I said you can but thats not best	1.0
	What did I say is best for zeros after the decimal that end it	8.0
	Harper	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	If there are zeros after the decimal spot thank you Taylor we dont typically write them	1.0
	Im not going to mark you wrong if you do but I really want you to get in the habit of leaving them off because that is how you see the numbers	1.0
	If I were to ask you to write 50 right now I dont think most of you would write decimal 000	1.0
	The actual value of that seven is 45 in seventenths not 45 and 700 thousands	1.0
	Yes its technically the same if you were to color it in a picture but the best practice is zeros after need to be left off	1.0
	I want you to think about what I said	1.0
	With your purple partner partner wearing closest to school spirit so if youre not wearing school spirit our colors are blue and green so whoevers got the most blue and green on pants count is first	1.0
	Show me a thumbs up when youve figured out whos first	2.0
	That partner is going to say What do we do with zeros that end the decimal	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Taylor what do we do with zeros that come at the end of the decimal	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	What I want to be clear is what Im talking about is something like this versus something like this	1.0
	If it ends the decimal you dont need them	1.0
	If its in the middle you need it	1.0
	You never erase it in the middle	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Its kind of like would I write a zero here in front of my three	2.0
	No	7.0
	No its the same with the decimal after the decimal	5.0
	We dont write it before the whole number and we dont write it after the last number of the decimal but do not take them out of the middle	1.0
	If theres a zero in the middle you leave	1.0
	Partner who didnt talk before what do you do if theres a zero in the middle of the decimal	8.0
	Go	2.0
	All right friends if you could meet me on the rug in 10 seconds	1.0
	Please bring your pencil and your math journal	1.0
	Two of my friends I see in the back	1.0
	Rob I see going to the front	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Please read our first target today Emma	2.0
	I disagree	1.0
	Not quite	1.0
	You are at the end of the word Emma	1.0
	Youre kind of putting something thats not here	1.0
	So lets chunk it	1.0
	Whats this	8.0
	Oh my goodness	1.0
	Go back	1.0
	Go back	1.0
	No not that far	1.0
	Here Ive got an idea	1.0
	First say this part	2.0
	The next three	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Blend that together	1.0
	Close	1.0
	Coordinate	1.0
	Very close	1.0
	Conjecture and maybe thats what you said	1.0
	I couldnt hear because there was some whispering in the back	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I can use what I know about coordinate graphs to create a conjuncture	1.0
	Now a conjuncture is a fancy math word for an educated prediction	1.0
	Our markers are kept our stuff is down	1.0
	Were engaged in the lesson and the learning	1.0
	A conjuncture is a fancy math word for a prediction based on math	1.0
	Taking what you know about math and then making a prediction about what you think is going to happen	1.0
	ET high five someone to close you	1.0
	If youre being blinded you could always either close that or just ask me to close it	1.0
	I dont see all of my partners here	1.0
	ET high five so I can see whos partners with who	1.0
	It looks like Blackstar Mala Marcello Jon Avery Taden	1.0
	Rob who are you with	1.0
	Youre going to need to join a group of three but youve got to show me who that group is with	1.0
	All right	1.0
	With your partner	1.0
	I want you to repeat in your own words what is a conjecture	2.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	You two are together you two are together and you two are together	1.0
	Robs here in the middle	1.0
	You can join any of these three groups but you cant just sit here and do nothing	1.0
	What group are you going to join	1.0
	You can make the choice Rob or I will make the choice for you	1.0
	I can	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Why dont you join this group right here with these boys	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Next	1.0
	Todd whats our next target	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Show me thumbs up thumbs down sideways	2.0
	Where are you feeling on this one	2.0
	Because this is not our first time weve encountered that target	1.0
	A lot of people feel successful some people are here	1.0
	Today were going to even more practice and hopefully move my friends here all the way up	1.0
	Take a moment to read my little cartoon about conjecture to give you a clearer idea of what that is	1.0
	With your partner how is that a conjecture	8.0
	How is what the man is saying a conjecture	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Jen are you and the Rita partners	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You want to look at her when shes talking	1.0
	Well think about whats a conjecture	1.0
	Write down there the definition if you forgot and how does that fit	8.0
	Hannah what do you think	8.0
	How is that picture a conjecture	8.0
	Then is he just guessing randomly	2.0
	How does he know	8.0
	Lets start with a complete sentence	1.0
	He knows because	1.0
	Whats he doing	8.0
	Whats the other man doing	8.0
	Whats the man with the books doing	8.0
	This is an obvious thing but how it relates to the idea of conjecture is that the man is not saying that the new accountant is trying to balance the books which by the way is a joke about accounting because as you will be learning with young AmeriTowne balancing the books and thats actually something weve done once so far this year is making sure that your records match the bank records	1.0
	Thats called balancingm like balancing your checkbook	1.0
	Thats like the joke of it but its conjecture because hes using his evidence	1.0
	Hes not just making a crazy guess	1.0
	Hes using what he sees and what he knows to make a prediction	1.0
	Now in the cartoon its supposed to be funny	1.0
	Its obvious	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Jen can you please read our first success criteria	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ethan	2.0
	Joel	2.0
	Avery	2.0
	All right	1.0
	The last three are going to be our big focus today	1.0
	Our purpose is going to be what happens to a picture as we change the coordinates on the X and Yaxis	1.0
	As you talk with each other I really want you to focus on that conjecture using math evidence using what you know and using that correct vocabulary	1.0
	Where can we find correct vocabulary if we need itI love how Shannon is pointing	1.0
	For now its their	1.0
	Gael pay attention my friend	1.0
	Can you tilt our easel please so the class can see the poster better	1.0
	Tilt it this way so it faces the group better	1.0
	Sure	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Getting our brains back to math and a little bit of practice	1.0
	Heres what this is about	1.0
	I do not want you to tell me the answer	1.0
	I want you to tell me which of these would the answer be closest to	8.0
	To figure that out youre thinking about the value of the fraction	1.0
	For example threefifths	1.0
	Is that closer to zero half or one	8.0
	Show me zero half one	1.0
	Okay I see a bit of a mix	1.0
	Todd youre showing me one	1.0
	Why do you say that	9.0
	What is	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to ask that you talk with your partner whichever one you said half or one I want you to think right now	1.0
	So dont talk yet	1.0
	Just think	1.0
	Why	9.0
	Why did you give me that answer	9.0
	Todd Im coming back to you	1.0
	Now share with your partner	3.0
	Back to you Todd	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	What would half of five be	8.0
		7.0
	Okay	1.0
	I hear two and a half	1.0
	I hear 25	5.0
	How would we say that	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	25 how do we say that correctly	8.0
	Think	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im not sure that youre understanding my question so let me clarify	1.0
	25 that is a decimal right	2.0
	So how would 25 its not accurately using math vocabulary how we say decimals	1.0
	How would we say 25 as a decimal	8.0
	If it helps you use your tools write it down look at it thats okay but how would we say 25	8.0
	Think	1.0
	Were all going to say it together	2.0
	Now my friends who arent looking at me didnt know to talk right Rachel	2.0
	Because you werent looking at me so you didnt see the signal	1.0
	2 510	1.0
	So is three closer to 2 510 or five	8.0
	What do you think	8.0
	Two and fivetenths	7.0
	Yes 2 510 which means thats actually closer to a half	5.0
	I would consider threefifths closer to a half	1.0
	Now think about 14	1.0
	Would 14 be closer to zero	2.0
	Half	2.0
	Or one	2.0
	Place them together	7.0
	No were not placing them together yet	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im seeing a lot of zeros	1.0
	So this question is asking and what Im going to ask you to do on your own in just a moment is I want you to think	1.0
	35 is close to a half 14 is close to zero 12 plus zero equals 12 so that means the answer must be closest to this is one	1.0
	Why do you say it is	9.0
	Never mind	7.0
	No not never mind	5.0
	Boys and girls when you have a thought come to your head or you feel you have an answer stuff went on in your brain to get you that answer and all Im asking is that you share whats going on in your brain because none of us are like Okay whats Sasha thinking right nowYes I agree with you Sasha	1.0
	Because were not mind readers	1.0
	So when I call on you to share your thinking I just want you to share whats going on in your brain	1.0
	Thats not hard because its going on in your brain	1.0
	You know its there	1.0
	Sasha	2.0
	14 is bigger than 15 so	7.0
	I see what shes thinking	1.0
	Shes thinking if you did 15 plus 35 thatd be 45 which is closer to one and 14 is even bigger than that so itd be even bigger than and even be more close to one	5.0
	All right	1.0
	I can see that	1.0
	The tricky thing about 14 is its smack in the middle of zero and half	1.0
	I think thinking about well 35 is closest to half but its a little bit over	1.0
	If Im going to put 14 to it which is even closer which is like smack in the middle thats going to bring it even closer to one	1.0
	Does that make sense too	2.0
	So thinking about it I think Sasha had a really great way of visualizing it and then also when you have 14 its tricky because its right in the middle	1.0
	Lets just do one more and then we need to move on	1.0
	What is this one closer to	8.0
	Write it on your whiteboard	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	Okay first of all lets look at our options up there I see some people showing things that arent an option	1.0
	So look at the options on the top	1.0
	Make sure that youre showing one of those options	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	Jackie I cant tell what your option is	1.0
	What are they when we put them together	8.0
	Whats it closer to	8.0
	All right	1.0
	I see mostly twos but I also see a 1 and 12 and 12	1.0
	So my friends who put two think	1.0
	Why would 12 be incorrect	9.0
	And my friend who put halfs my friend who put half why might that be incorrect	9.0
	Who would like to share their thinking	8.0
	Avery	2.0
	Annie sorry	1.0
	Is 1 23 over a half	2.0
	Youre adding more to that	1.0
	So half doesnt make sense because one of my digits is already way over a half	1.0
	One of my digits is already closest to what number	8.0
	Two	1.0
	So that would be for my friends who put 1 12 I would say the same thing	1.0
	1 23 is already bigger than 1 12 and Im adding even more to that	1.0
	So thats going to push me up close to two	1.0
	All right nice job	1.0
	You have this in your math journal on page 134 and 135	1.0
	Please take a moment to turn	1.0
	We arent really going to be using our whiteboards anymore	1.0
	You can put them in the marker up to the side	1.0
	Im not saying I wont ask you to write an ordered pair or something on it	1.0
	So still have it accessible but okay	1.0
	So please point	1.0
	Never mind	1.0
	You cant point to anything	1.0
	Its going to be right here	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Right now point in your book on page 135 to where it says original sailboat	1.0
	Point to that	1.0
	Look at your neighbor	1.0
	Make sure theyre pointing to the right thing	1.0
	Help them if theyre not	1.0
	Friends I didnt say tap this is pointing	1.0
	This is not  not what Im asking for	1.0
	All right the original sailboat	1.0
	You are going to plot these points right here	1.0
	Fiveone	1.0
	Plot that on here	1.0
	Take a moment to plot those points	1.0
	Thats okay	1.0
	Im going to ask you to stop because I need to clarify something	1.0
	When youre plotting these points you need to do what I call dot connect because youre going to be creating a picture	1.0
	If Im looking at fiveone Im going to put it here	1.0
	Then whats my next one	8.0
	Fiveseven	7.0
	X five Y seven	5.0
	Im going to dot connect and make a line	1.0
	Then the next point	1.0
	Ive done both of these	1.0
	Actually Ill do a check	1.0
	Come on friend	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Check and check	1.0
	Next youre going to plot one two and dot connect	1.0
	Every single one you make every dot you connect it to your last dot	1.0
	Im going to write some names up here to come and plot for us and as soon as theyve plotted the next name come up	1.0
	Ill move	1.0
	Then you can see them	1.0
	In the meantime youre working on your own	1.0
	Yes	2.0
	What do you mean	2.0
	Im sorry	1.0
	Youre right	1.0
	Its cut off at the top	1.0
	Let me see this real fast	1.0
	Come on up black star	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You pointed out sorry sorry sorry	1.0
	It was cut off up here so I didnt see it	1.0
	You guys on yours	1.0
	If you look at the chart under original sailboat youll see all these same coordinates	1.0
	Your name is next to it	1.0
	As soon as youre done you hand it to Maggie whos going to do it	1.0
	Dont forget dot connect	1.0
	You guys are all plotting right now	1.0
	Show me a thumbs up if youre done and you have your picture	1.0
	If youre not done keep working	1.0
	Can I see your book	1.0
	Friends this also has your coordinates right here	1.0
	If you cant see whats up here you can look at your book right here and get the coordinates	1.0
	If theres a dot here already you dot connect for the last plot we made	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	The last point that was made was this one	1.0
	Connect the dots	1.0
	Youre always dot connect to the last point that was made	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Pass it on	1.0
	Jon and Avery your eyes arent here	1.0
	Im going to ask Jon what do you think about the last point	8.0
	Hold on Shannon	1.0
	What do you think about it	8.0
	You also have your book in front of you where you can look and if you were paying attention to what was going on	1.0
	I saw quite a few people agreeing which makes me wonder what your sailboats look like	1.0
	Whats the important thing to tell coach Rachel about	8.0
	Because shes close but she made that very common mistake	1.0
	Ethan what do you think	8.0
	Which one comes first	8.0
	Which one is the X	8.0
	Right but which line is the X	8.0
	You went up to but youve got to remember think of an airplane	1.0
	An airplane has to taxi before it goes up	1.0
	Go over to and then zero	1.0
	This is the X	1.0
	You have to go over one two	1.0
	I know its hidden but theres a zero right here	1.0
	This is the zero line for Y	1.0
	This is the zero line for X	1.0
	Wed go one two and wed leave it there because the Y is zero	1.0
	Nope down here	1.0
	You switched that one	1.0
	No it says two zero	1.0
	Thats X over two up zero	1.0
	I did not switch them	1.0
	No listen	1.0
	Listen to what I said because I said it correctly	1.0
	This line here is zero	1.0
	If theres a zero in the Y I said this is the line is zero for the Yaxis	1.0
	Anytime the line is zero its always going to be on that bottom line	1.0
	Anytime the X is zero its always going to be on this line	1.0
	Thats what I was saying and that is not	1.0
	Now connect to the last coordinate	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Double check yours	1.0
	Did you make that same flip mistake	2.0
	Because I saw a lot of thumbs up with Rachels point	1.0
	I know its tricky because the numbers are hidden here	1.0
	I wonder if I can get rid of that	1.0
	Hold on lets see if I cant get rid of that	1.0
	Careful how youre holding the pen	1.0
	No thats not what I want at all	1.0
	Wait	1.0
	A little bit further up	1.0
	Here	1.0
	No not good enough	1.0
	Stop it	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	Not good enough	1.0
	Im going to use the mouse	1.0
	Can I get rid of this	2.0
	Go away okay Shannon what I was saying is that even though there are no numbers here because this toolkit is blocking it we still know one two you can still count the lines to figure it up	1.0
	There you go connect to the last one	1.0
	Okay we want to be careful when we are connecting that you use a straight line what tool when you get back to your seat could you use to help you	8.0
	Rita	2.0
	Pardon in a nice complete sentence	1.0
	Right you want to make sure that you are using tools to help you if needed all right	1.0
	Just press that little the two arrows pointing towards each other yes press that it will all go away	1.0
	All right so your sailboat looks like this sailboat	1.0
	If it doesnt that means you made a little mistake and you want to doublecheck all of your coordinates	1.0
	All right now I want you to take a look at the chart that says New sailboat number two	1.0
	Number one sorry new sailboat number one	1.0
	Put your finger on it check with your neighbor are they looking at the right place	3.0
	Please read to me whats the rule of that new sailboat is Kevin	2.0
	Okay so what does double mean	8.0
	Think for a moment think think think share with your partner	2.0
	Rita what does double mean	8.0
	I love that wonderful complete sentence so eight times two equals	8.0
	X times two is 16 we go to the Y one times two is	8.0
	Theres our new coordinate pair first before you graph anything I see people with their pencils up either finishing or have I asked you to write anything yet	2.0
	What was one of our learning targets today that had to do with this word right here	8.0
	Shannon	2.0
	Yes in your own words it doesnt have to be exact but what are we doing with this word today	8.0
	Okay so I want you to show me a thumbs up if youre trying to think right now of what that learning target with conjecture was thumbs down if youre just waiting and thinking about other things waiting for Shannon to do the work for you of thinking	2.0
	Yes no ones going to probably put their thumb down and admit that but I can tell that many people good	1.0
	Im glad youre honest I can tell that many people are just waiting for Shannon to do the work for them thats not what you do if I ask her a question and shes thinking you are also thinking because what if I say Jessica	1.0
	Which happens to be the one with the hand raised Help her out	1.0
	Say it in your own words	2.0
	Were making an educated guess based on math	2.0
	Just whatever we feel based on what	2.0
	Think about what Jessica said Jessica will you repeat it for me please	2.0
	Okay so if Im going to make an educated guess based on math for my conjecture so what do I think is going to happen to the new boat	8.0
	What is my new boat going to look like	8.0
	Thats what the conjecture is asking what is your new boat going to look like	8.0
	Share that with your partner just the question what question are we going to solve	8.0
	Stop because I hear people answering it I didnt ask you to share your answer because you havent had time to think to make a good conjecture	1.0
	Share what is the question youre making a conjecture about	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Five four three two and one so in order to do that we have to have an understanding of what	8.0
	Who can share what do we need to have an understanding of in order to make a good conjecture and Im giving you a big hint right now as I do that	8.0
	Ben	2.0
	Right so we have to have a good understanding of what happens to the X when you go bigger or smaller what happens to the Y when you go bigger or smaller	2.0
	Okay so take a moment right now to think what conjecture could you make about your sailboat when we double the numbers	8.0
	Mr Michaels will you let Jared in and then put the magnet in the door	1.0
	Okay share with your partner	2.0
	Arianna what do you think	8.0
	Whats it	8.0
	Okay Rylee whats your conjecture	8.0
	Okay Harmony	2.0
	Okay so Harmony listening to your friends who came before then do you agree disagree	3.0
	Okay I want you to make sure with your conjecture youre very specific because bigger whats getting bigger	8.0
	Is it getting taller is it getting wider	8.0
	Is it getting both	2.0
	I love the two times bigger but I still need a little bit more specificity okay so think about that	1.0
	When when you say bigger and by the way I did not see my	1.0
	active listening thumbs	1.0
	I if I say that I dont mean every single person theres usually always two or three or four people	1.0
	I mean as a class I need to see everybody not just a spattering	1.0
	So repeat to your partner with more specific whats your conjecture	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Waterfall	1.0
	Sean whats your new conjecture thats a little more specific	8.0
	Okay so think about my hint what can Sean add to make his even better	3.0
	What can Sean add to make his even better Hannah	3.0
	What do you think	8.0
	Taller wider or both	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Why	9.0
	Okay	1.0
	One thing I love that Sean did is I saw him struggling a little bit with the math vocabulary	1.0
	He looked behind him at the poster to affirm what vocabulary he needed to use	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Take a moment please to finish this up	1.0
	Im going to use my cards to come up here and write them in	1.0
	Youre finishing them but youre also listening to your name so you can come up here Sophie	2.0
	Youre just going to go in order	1.0
	Youre timesing both by two	1.0
	Annie youre after Sophie	2.0
	Raelynn after Annie then Jon then Jackie and last Elise	2.0
	You guys are doing it on your paper while you wait	1.0
	Then youre handing it to the next person whos thank you very much Annie for remembering and standing up	1.0
	Who was after Raelynn	2.0
	Jon	2.0
	I love that	1.0
	I saw some active listening thumbs	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I love those active listening thumbs	1.0
	Everybody got that correctly	1.0
	Next step is to graph it	1.0
	Graph it	1.0
	Wait Im looking around	1.0
	No one wrote their conjecture down	1.0
	I know I didnt write it on mine just because I knew I was going to move	1.0
	Please pause for a moment and write your conjecture down using that specific math vocabulary that was a part of our target today	1.0
	Once your conjecture is written then you can start plotting	1.0
	I wrote the numbers up because it was faster than writing names of the people who are going to plot	1.0
	In this order youre going to come up and plot the new sailboat points	1.0
	Please take a look at that	1.0
	Taylors going to start with the 8 1 and then Blackstar is going to finish not with 8 1	1.0
	Its the second conjecture	1.0
	It was at 16 2 and then black stars going to finish with 16 2 so if your number is in the middle take a look and see which plot points youre going to plot and we can get started	1.0
	Go ahead and do the first	1.0
	You can finish up your own estimate	1.0
	Keep plotting yours Jackie	1.0
	Plot your own	1.0
	Dont worry about what theyre doing	1.0
	Just keep plotting until youre finished with your own	1.0
	Can you make your dot a little bit bigger	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Todd is next	2.0
	Hannah	2.0
	This was the first second third fourth	1.0
	Countdown before we start to see which one that is	1.0
	Make your dot bigger for me	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Jen is next	2.0
	Jen youre doing the fifth one down	1.0
	Hannah I think you Hold on Jen	1.0
	I think you plotted the original not the new sailboat	1.0
	Lets get that back to Hannah and then stay right here unless you need to doublecheck your thinking	1.0
	Because youre plotting the new one not the old ones	1.0
	Once youve finished plotting your sailboat youre going to take a look and start using your active listening thumbs	1.0
	Its the fifth one down	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Right now youre not working ahead	1.0
	Youre looking here and helping them out	1.0
	Who can help Jen out	3.0
	What coordinates is she supposed to be plotting	3.0
	Call on someone Jen you can choose someone to help you	3.0
	2 4	7.0
	No	1.0
	Hannah just did the 2 4	5.0
	10 2	7.0
	Plot the points 10 2	5.0
	Friends if your numbers up here make sure you know which coordinate youre plotting based on looking at your own book	1.0
	Ethans next please push this thing to make it go away	2.0
	Again youll have to be really careful about pushing that button	1.0
	Next person be standing ready to take this so we can speed this up a little bit	1.0
	Next person hello	2.0
	Joel just went	1.0
	Whose turn is it next	2.0
	Hang on	1.0
	You should be able to	1.0
	All right friends	1.0
	What do you think	8.0
	This look like your sailboat	2.0
	Now show me yes or no was your conjecture correct	2.0
	Think why	9.0
	Why was your conjecture correct	9.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Why was your conjecture correct	9.0
	Share with your partner	2.0
	Why was you conjecture correct	9.0
	What were you trying to go	1.0
	That you have to go to not there so go here to the table score entry  some sort and then okay you have to go here and choose that day and then thatll open it up because you have to first say what day youre doing it	1.0
	Now you can click on the conjecture	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	My friends waiting for the restroom	1.0
	Who have I not really heard from today	2.0
	I have not really heard from Jackie	1.0
	Was your conjecture right	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	I have no idea what she just said sorry	1.0
	Pass that to her	1.0
	My question then is why does timesing this x by two make it wider	9.0
	Nicole	2.0
	You can pass that to her	1.0
	All right the next step boys and girls is you are going to complete sailboats two and three	1.0
	Your conjecture because thats one of our learning targets as well as the order pairs as well as the graph	1.0
	When you are finished you are going to tear out the page that has the graphs and turn that in as your exit slip	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Let me see what the back	1.0
	Thats what we should be doing	1.0
	Actually yes	1.0
	Thats probably going to take us about 15 to 20 minutes	1.0
	Probably up till 1030 so youre going to do that and yes you may have snack once you get to your desk and you are working independently	1.0
	I will put our targets back up to remind you what you need to focus on	1.0
Yes	Read it with me please	2.0
	Study that diagram there and you thumbs up when you understand that diagram and how its demonstrating multiplying fractions by whole numbers	1.0
	Fabulous	1.0
	Going to have you talk with your shoulder partner please	2.0
	Partner A goes first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets just make sure  we understand that diagram and how it demonstrates multiplying fractions by whole numbers	1.0
	can you explain that	8.0
I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre doing 26  26	I dont hear a lot of people or see a lot of people ringing in	1.0
	Did you not hear her	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Can you try again just so that everybody knows what you said so they can feedback you	2.0
I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre adding 26  26  26  26 because thats the same thing as 4 x 26	Okay theres people kind of going	1.0
	Can you call on somebody to respond to you please	2.0
I see why you thought that each two squares equals a whole because I think you got confused by where the 4 when it said 4 x 26 theres four groups of two inside that you thought that two blocks equal the whole	I still disagree	1.0
	I dont know what you mean by blocks	1.0
	Both of you keep using this word blocks	1.0
	We have two different shapes up there	1.0
	What are the shapes that are colored called	8.0
	Say it in your hands	2.0
	Let it out	2.0
Squares	What are the squares part of	8.0
	Say that in your hands	2.0
	Now say it out loud	2.0
Rectangles	Now can you modify your explanation using that vocabulary to help us	8.0
	Thank you	1.0
Two squares and the rectangle are equal to a whole	Why do you say that theyre equal to a whole	9.0
	Im confused about that part	1.0
Because theyre supposed to be four wholes so two of them	Respond to her ask her a question if possible	1.0
	Okay somebody thats saying Hey can I ask you a question to help you	1.0
16	So would 16 really represent the whole	2.0
	What represents the whole in this diagram	8.0
The rectangle	The rectangle represents the whole	5.0
	What do you guys think of that Conor	3.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	How is this showing that its 4 x 26 again	8.0
	Explain your thinking again	8.0
Because there are four 26 which is	Im still confused what youre talking about whole of 26	5.0
	What do you mean by that	8.0
I think she means	Hold on she can do this	1.0
	Shes so close	1.0
Then the 26 are the two squares in the next rectangle	Okay and so you have how many 26	8.0
Four	Four so youre showing 4 x 26	5.0
	And you explained that one way of showing it is your addition and another way of showing it through multiplication	1.0
	Whats your learning here	8.0
I	Everybody think	1.0
	What would you say  learning could be	8.0
	Because it applies to a lot of us not just	1.0
	Im sure of it	1.0
	Whats the learning here for everybody about how we explain our thinking	8.0
	Its partner Bs turn to go first	2.0
	Tell your partner Whats the learning	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	whats your learning	8.0
To use better vocabulary	How many of you said to use really specific vocabulary	2.0
	Good	1.0
	Did you have anything else you wanted to add	3.0
	Well okay	1.0
	Anybody else have anything that you thought you should add	3.0
	Charlie	2.0
Make your answer clear and	Do you think using the vocabulary helps to make that more clear	2.0
	Oaklee	2.0
Make sure it makes sense	Make sure your answer makes sense	5.0
	And that vocabulary could be a component of that	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	You did a good job handling that	1.0
	I know its hard when Im questioning you	1.0
	Im trying to help you work on being really clear and being very specific	1.0
	Youre going to be solving a problem	1.0
	Thats how you know that your  on solving this is getting the correct answer	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Yesterday  vocabulary	1.0
	Were going to do a practice problem on our Slate before we finish that journal paper with our partner	1.0
	Great job with coming up with the success criteria  by the way	1.0
	Those are fabulous	1.0
	Im just going to move those	1.0
	Yesterday we were practicing two strategies	1.0
	One that we had learned the day before that involved finding a unit fraction and multiplying that times the numerator	1.0
	The other one was multiplying the numerator times the whole number and dividing the deno the whole then dividing that component by the denominator	1.0
	Those were the two ways	1.0
	Im remembering that but Im still a little confused	1.0
	Okay so heres the problem	1.0
	If you got time do both strategies	1.0
	If you dont have time pick a strategy that you know best to solve with	1.0
	12 x 34 or 34 of 12	1.0
	Pick a strategy you know best to solve that	1.0
	Please do it on your Slate	1.0
	You can look in your math journal	1.0
	I dont want just an answer I want to see how you got to your answer	1.0
	topic  person two is going to start by showing their work and discussing it with the team	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	There were several people that did a great job with explaining	1.0
	But in the effort to conserve time for the other lesson I want to cover today Im going  here	1.0
	This was the first method that we talked about earlier this week	1.0
	Does it matter if I say 34 x 12 first	2.0
No	No their the same	5.0
	all right	1.0
	I took 12 and I put it into four groups because thats how many groups were dividing it in here	1.0
	This is a 14 this is a 14 this is a 14 this is a 14 but were finding what three of those groups are because thats the numerator	1.0
	Theres three here three here three here that equals nine	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Would this be practical with larger whole numbers	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Thats why you are trying to move away from making pictures but sometimes pictures help that get really clear to us so we understand	1.0
	I would just divide this by four multiply it times three because I find the unit fraction by dividing it by four I find one unit and multiply it times three	1.0
	Rate how well you understand this method	1.0
	Okay super	1.0
	Then yesterday we talked about another method	1.0
	This method was more of the equation form taking the whole number multiplying it times the numerator and then dividing it by four	1.0
	Here I would have 36 divided by four which equals nine	1.0
	That was the second way	1.0
	Rate how well you understand that way	2.0
	Okay fabulous	1.0
	I do want to say that there were several students that left math yesterday to go to another math group	1.0
	So it would be clear that they would need a little instruction a little practice a little explanation	1.0
	So please be kind and patient and understand what that would be like if somebody said Wait class for the entire time and Now today were talking about it And can we expect them to know what we talked about	2.0
No	No so please be kind and patient just as you always are	5.0
	All right	1.0
	Let me have you work with your partner back on page 170	1.0
	You need to read and follow directions and complete 170 with your partner	1.0
	If somebody was gone maybe youre doing SageNScribe so that they see what we did	1.0
	All right ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Were on the twominute warning	1.0
	Okay friends	1.0
	Because were on day two of this lesson we are going to just quickly check it because Id really like to get to the other lesson today as well all right	2.0
	I feel like we checked number one A and B yesterday	1.0
	Number two what did you get for an answer	8.0
	Charlie	2.0
I got 12	What do you guys think 12	3.0
I got 12 and 48	Excellent	1.0
	48 is it the same thing as 12	2.0
Yes	I am totally fine if you leave it as 48	1.0
	Im totally fine if you put it as 12	1.0
	Both of those make sense	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	Number four	1.0
	You need to tell us the number model and the answer please	1.0
	Troy number four	8.0
I didnt	All right	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Because remember some of us were not in the room yesterday	1.0
	Stella number four please	8.0
Number four our number  10 x 45	Equals R Just put the variable	1.0
	So if you didnt have a variable please add that	1.0
	10 x 45  R Are you dividing	2.0
	No multiplying	1.0
	She used 48 Does it say 48 or 45	8.0
	She used 45 of it to tie a bow how much of the ribbon did she use	8.0
	Its multiplying	1.0
	Youre not breaking it into groups	1.0
	Youre multiplying	1.0
	Then what was the actual answer	8.0
The right answer I got eight feet	Eight feet	4.0
	Nicely done but remember  incorrect so you both need to fix that	1.0
	Thats why Im saying that	1.0
	Hudson	2.0
10 x 48   by 5	It is but were also looking for it is a fraction	1.0
	Thats what the whole point of this lesson is	1.0
	Look at the top of your page	1.0
	See	2.0
	It says multiplying whole numbers by fractions	1.0
	So should it be expressed as a fraction	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Is it the same as saying x 4   5	2.0
	Yes but keep learning intention in mind okay	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Good question	1.0
	Number five Alijah	8.0
My number model was 14 x 56  F	You agree	3.0
	What dont you agree with Oaklee	3.0
I agree with him but he also could say 14 x 5  70   6  F	No	1.0
	Remember what we just talked about with Hudson	2.0
	Hudson tell him what we just said	2.0
We just said we want to The learning intention is about  use it as a fraction	Yes multiplying whole numbers by fractions so its present as the fraction even though thats what the process was for you to solve it	5.0
	Okay Oaklee does that make sense	2.0
	Then what was the actual answer Alijah	8.0
11 and 46	You have to include the unit	1.0
11 and 46 feet	11 and 46 feet or another way of saying that would be 11 and 23 feet okay	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	We are going to close this lesson before we go on so lets go back to this	1.0
	First of all I know Im successful when I can apply one of the strategies practiced in this lesson on problems two and four on page 170	1.0
	So rate how well you were able to	2.0
	Its okay to be a two if you werent here	1.0
	Its okay right	2.0
	If youre like Im getting parts of this but Im not quite where I need to be	1.0
	Its okay especially if you werent in the room	1.0
	I dont know how I would function at all so thank you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets look at this	1.0
	Read the summary with me	2.0
	play the game so were not going to be able to summarize	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Start	1.0
	Now we are on the next lesson	1.0
	Lets read the learning intention	2.0
	So how is this lesson different than what we were just doing	1.0
	Sorry Im choking on my own spit	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You can laugh	1.0
	It is funny	1.0
	Do	1.0
Yes	So talk with your page partner	2.0
	Whats different about what were going to start now than what we were just doing	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	How is this different Gabriella	8.0
This is different because were multiplying whole numbers by fractions to find fractions	Thats what weve been doing but what are we going to be doing now	8.0
	Go to the last line of the learning intention	1.0
Finding fractions of fractions	Yes so now youre multiplying fractions by fractions	5.0
	How many of you said that	3.0
	Yes thats what were doing	1.0
	I want to make sure you understand what apply means	1.0
	Can you please read the word applys definition for us Charlie	2.0
Apply to complete  using what you have learned already	Does that makes sense	2.0
Yes	Then extend	1.0
	Show me a definition of extend	8.0
	Were adding on	1.0
	We knew this much now were adding on all right	2.0
	So we are going to take what we learned previously and add on	1.0
	This is how youre going to know that youve	1.0
	Can someone read this for us	2.0
I have  I can explain how one or take  model is a representation of fraction products	And  what that means	8.0
	Talk with your partner about what that means please	8.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Clay what does this mean that we have to be able to do	8.0
It means that were going to have to be able to explain how our paper folding model or drawing helps us explain how we did the fraction product	Whats fraction product	8.0
What our answer was	From multiplying	8.0
A fraction times a fraction	You got it	2.0
	Thats what those papers in the center of your team are	1.0
	I had one group of people that were like Oh my gosh what does this mean to my weekend plan	1.0
	It means nothing to your weekend plan	1.0
	Its what the tools are for us	1.0
	You see how  paper folding models so well be using those	1.0
	Lets look at No there is no more vocabulary	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	apply Slate and Slate I think is a good transition for us	1.0
	So	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right here we go	1.0
	Find 12 of 12	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	You said 6 x You have 12 of twelve donuts	1.0
	Thats a lot of donuts	1.0
	Youd want to share right	2.0
No	Asher	1.0
	Youre my new favorite	1.0
	12 of 15	1.0
	Great job	1.0
	If you said 7 and 12 youre correct	1.0
	Who can explain how they got 7 and 12 because some of us are still back at 12 of 15	8.0
	What do I do	8.0
	Harlowe	2.0
If we break 1 into 2 itd be half   I one of those half to my answers	split your dozen donuts between two people	1.0
	Thats generous definitely	1.0
No its not	You have fifteen donuts	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	One Does that say 12 of 40	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	12 of 40	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Now were going to do a little more challenging	1.0
	Nothing crazy	1.0
	23 of 12	1.0
We just answered that	Yes we did just answer that	5.0
	Good job	1.0
	FlashGood job	1.0
	Ive got some friends that said four	1.0
	Most of us said eight	1.0
	Think for a minute	1.0
	My friends that said four what step do they need to still do	3.0
	What does it sound like they did	3.0
	What did they do River	3.0
Were all still finishing the  I have  by two to get eight	So youve found what	8.0
I did find 13 and then I  by two	To find 23	1.0
	Great job River with your explanation	1.0
	Take your time my little friends that were like Four back to a Eight	1.0
	Heres the next one	1.0
	23 of 15	1.0
	FlashNice job if you said 10	1.0
	Marcos what do you need to do	8.0
	Once you come What do you need to do	8.0
	You have to multiply it by this numerator here 23 not just 13	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Youre putting this together now	1.0
	Do you see why we do this	2.0
	It helps you figure some things out	1.0
	Is this what weve been practicing	2.0
Yes	Same thing	1.0
	23 of 60	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	One of you go	1.0
		1.0
	You want to do another round of it	2.0
Yes	Fun right	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	25 of 12   remainder as a fraction	1.0
	Thats what you were just doing also	1.0
	FlashOh my	1.0
	Were breaking down	1.0
	Houston were breaking down	1.0
	I see some people that have	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	If you have no idea what to do talk with your team	2.0
	if you have some idea write it on your own	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Who can explain what it is 4 and 45 for us	8.0
What	Yes	1.0
	I saw it	1.0
	I know three people that have it	1.0
	Hank	2.0
And then we do Its 2 and 25 then when you do that times two you get 4 and 45	Im not sure I understand	1.0
	Can you write it out to show us	8.0
	You can use the whiteboard you can do it on your slate and put it under the  cameraI need to see a visual of your thinking please	1.0
	Im so visual	1.0
	Is anybody else in here so visual	1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Go through it with   I see that you wrote it this way	1.0
	You started by saying 12 and then you switched it to 25 of 12	1.0
	Does it matter	2.0
	Whats 2 x 3	8.0
six	Whats 3 x 2	8.0
Six	Six	4.0
	Does it matter if you say 25 of 12 and 12 of 25	2.0
	Does the order matter	2.0
No	It doesnt but keep going	1.0
	Go ahead	1.0
	Your marker is kind of faint you might want to grab my marker	1.0
	I think it might be  but yours has been a little worn out with all of yourhard work	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Hes like Yes Im right	1.0
	Ms Rupus I think theres a black one	1.0
	Okay Hank your point is to explain it while youre doing it	1.0
	Can you do that	8.0
Then I did that times 2 and then I got 4 and 45	What did you find when you divided twelve by five	8.0
	What were you finding what part of the fraction	8.0
	Everybody talk with their partner	2.0
	When he divided it initially by five divided the whole number by five what was he finding	3.0
	What was he finding when he divided by five initially	3.0
	Hank	2.0
I was finding 15 of 12	And then why did you multiply it times two	9.0
I did find the numerator which was two	What would be a way to check a reasonable list of this	8.0
	How do you check	8.0
	No were not making an estimate	1.0
	Think about your answer your product	1.0
	Think about your product	1.0
	How would you know if your product is probably correct	8.0
	Its not when an estimate  If you multiply 12 x 12 that would be putting an estimate way but theres another way	1.0
	Ryland	2.0
Youre only finding 25 of 12	Your product should be less than both of those factors shouldnt it	2.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I can tell we need another practice of this	1.0
	This is what we were  in the Math lesson	1.0
	Were going to need another one of this	1.0
	Lets give Micale a round of applause	1.0
	Nice job keeping your composure when youre on the hot seat there	1.0
	25 of 31	1.0
	25 of 31	1.0
	Awesome	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Im going to  just to generate a bunch of things how long you think a couple of hours	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	All right flash please	1.0
	Ive noticed that all of our answers are definitely smaller than both the factors that sounds good	1.0
	Im going to show you this	1.0
Yes	If you did not get this talk to your team	1.0
	If you cant see what your error was	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Back to me	1.0
	I get this I need to practice some more	1.0
	Did you get what Im doing I need to practice some more  Lets move on to the math message then	1.0
	Mental math inclusive	1.0
	Math message	1.0
	Work with a partner to solve the following problems	1.0
	You may use drawings open circle pieces or the fraction number line poster to help you	1.0
	One 12 of 3	1.0
	Two 12 of 34	1.0
	Remember the learning attention	1.0
	Weve been doing this type of problem like number on	1.0
	Were moving towards doing the problem like number two	1.0
	Make sure youre not dominating make sure you let your partner do some of the thinking too	1.0
	Both brains are working	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	Can explain our thinking	1.0
	I saw some people with drawings for number one	1.0
	Franc has a drawing that they do on the  under there  to show us	1.0
	Thank you  and Wren way to go Penelope	1.0
	Show us  yay yes	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Yes so if you want to  You might want to shrink this	1.0
	Were on number one	1.0
	12 of 3	1.0
	Save this thank you	1.0
	Save it	1.0
	Somebody that did 12 of 3 as a drawing	1.0
	Thank you as a drawing	2.0
	Okay great	1.0
	Thats what were looking for	1.0
	I want that	1.0
	too	1.0
12 plus 12 will equal three	Nicely done	1.0
	Thank you very much way to go	1.0
	Theres two people Im going to invite up there now	1.0
	Its actually three people  to go	1.0
	Im going to have you guys go and then Im going to have you show  circles	1.0
	Go on up both all of you who are ready to go because were losing daylight	1.0
	Closing in on the end	1.0
	Okay talk to us about your thinking	1.0
Each half gets one	You split half of the fourth	1.0
	How did you know that a four could be broken into eighths	8.0
	I see your answer there	1.0
Eighths are equivalent to fours you can make	Eighths are equivalent to fourths	5.0
	One eighth is equivalent to one fourth	2.0
	No	1.0
Fourths are equivalent to eighth	Fours are equivalent to eighths	5.0
	A fourth 14 is equal to 18	2.0
	How many eighths are equivalent to 14	8.0
Two	Two 28 is equivalent to 14	5.0
	How can you prove that	8.0
Its because	Draw something that proves it	1.0
	Explain your thinking	8.0
I drew eights and this are equal to four	What do you guys think	3.0
	Do you agree	3.0
Yes	Good	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What do you think	3.0
	Can they make a good drawing	3.0
	Can they explain their thinking well	3.0
	Yes nice job	1.0
	Give them a round of applause	1.0
	Very well done	1.0
	Okay lets see the  circle pieces because that might help some of us too	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
Since  12 and 34	We	1.0
We said the answer is 38 because half of six is three and if we do 68 its dividable by 12 because	I think you could still use the fourths because you could show Okay this fourth goes to this person and this fourth goes to this half	1.0
	Maybe show us that show us that we will not	1.0
You could do	Move them kind of a side	1.0
	There you go	1.0
Theres 14 remaining so you split 14 into 12 and you give each person 18	Put your eighths on there	5.0
Yes	to show that	1.0
It pretty much gives you them a 38 if you give him 18	What do you think	3.0
	Great job	1.0
	Great job knowing the equivalents and I can tell you understand the equivalents I can tell they understand the equivalents	1.0
	Round of applause	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	Very good	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets go Now were finding fractions of fractions	1.0
	What you just did that second problem is what were doing today	1.0
	Now were going to work into  Here we go	1.0
	Lets get you hungry	1.0
	Just in time for snacks	1.0
Aww	Read the scenario which is	2.0
What part of a whole fruit bar will Larry give to his brother	I know that some of you already have ideas	1.0
	Thats fabulous	1.0
	Were going to do the paperfolding part of this	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Everybody get a sheet of the paper and Id like you to get two markers out as well	1.0
	Two differentcolored markers	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Eyes on me please	1.0
	I want you to take your paper and fold it in half vertically	1.0
	This is a model	1.0
	Remember how are making models for science fair	1.0
	We made science models God bless you	1.0
	This is a model of the fruit bar	1.0
	God bless you	1.0
	Does he have an entire fruit bar	2.0
No	No	4.0
	This is how much of a fruit bar he has	1.0
	Youre going to take one marker and make slashes like I just did	1.0
	What does this represent	8.0
	Shoulder partner A tell shoulder partner B What does this represent	8.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Eliana what does this represent	8.0
	This represents a fruit bar	1.0
	I just took it out of its wrapper	1.0
	This represents what	8.0
Half	This represents what from our problem Eliana	8.0
	This is how much Larry has	1.0
	Look at the problem	1.0
	Larry has half of a fruit bar	1.0
	He doesnt have the whole thing he only has half	1.0
	Thats what these lines represent	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I get this part so far I dont get it	1.0
	Now Im going to take my fruit bar that I have half of and Im going to give half of it to my brother	1.0
	Im going to fold it in half	1.0
	Folding it in half	1.0
	Because I have half and Im going to give half to my brother because hes a nice guy	1.0
	Take your other marker and I want you to shade dont shade yet Im going to show you how I want you to do it	1.0
	I want you to shade the opposite direction	1.0
	See how Im making Xs when I shade the opposite direction	2.0
	Thats why I wanted you to slash diagonally and this is diagonal again with the other  What does this represent	8.0
	What does this represent now	8.0
	Partner B explain to partner A what this represents	8.0
	Back to me	1.0
	What does this now represent Davis	8.0
It represents Larrys brothers side	Do you think  Yes	2.0
	How much does his brother have	8.0
	If you want to open up the paper	1.0
	This was the whole granola bar fruit bar	1.0
	How many parts have we broken it into	8.0
	Show me	1.0
Four	Four	4.0
	How many parts did Larry have	8.0
Two	Two	4.0
	How many parts does his brother have	8.0
One	One	4.0
	Out of how many parts	8.0
Four	He had one out of the whole fruit bar but Larry had only half	1.0
	I wanted you to see how we came up with the name 14	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I get this model I dont get this model	1.0
	Pretty fun isnt it	1.0
	He had 14 of that fruit bar	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Do you want to try another one	2.0
Yes	Good	1.0
	I love your enthusiasm	1.0
	Oh I wish Juliet were here	1.0
	Her names up here	1.0
	Who would like to read our question for us	2.0
Thank you	Jimmy	2.0
How much of a whole pizza did she eat	What does this paper like this now represent	8.0
	Now let it out	2.0
A whole pizza	Does she have a whole pizza	2.0
No	No so fold your paper in half vertically like we did before	5.0
	What are we going to do on this part of the paper and why	9.0
	Tell your shoulder partner its Partner As turn	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What does this represent	8.0
	What does this represent	8.0
	Britny	2.0
This side of the pizza represents the half that Juliet had	There we go	1.0
	How many of you said that same thing to your partners	3.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Now we have to look at the next part	1.0
	She eats 23 of the half	1.0
	23 of the half	1.0
	Think are we going to just fold this in half like we did before	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Because how much did she eat of this	8.0
23	How many parts do we have to fold this into	8.0
	Show me	1.0
	Two folded into three	1.0
	We need to fold it into three equal parts	1.0
	equal parts	2.0
	Good yours should look like mine	1.0
	How many of you have three equal	2.0
	How many of you think you know how to shade	2.0
	Good try it	1.0
	Give it a shot	1.0
	Shes going to eat 23 of what she had	1.0
	Your marks need to go in the opposite direction	1.0
	You need to fill it out	1.0
	How many of you have something that looks like this	2.0
	Does this represent the half of the pizza	2.0
	Are you going to shade in all three parts	2.0
No	Because how much did she eats	8.0
23	Yes she ate 23	5.0
	How much of a whole pizza did she eat	8.0
	open it up	1.0
	How much of a whole pizza did she eat	8.0
	One two three four five six is the denominator	1.0
	She ate 26 of	1.0
	Must have been a small  right	2.0
Juliets hungry	Yes	1.0
	What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell	8.0
	This is the last thing were going to talk about and then were going to stop	1.0
	How do you know that this What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell	8.0
	Use your model while youre talking to your partner	2.0
	Partner Bs turn to talk first	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Okay back to me	1.0
	What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell	8.0
	Oaklee	2.0
Sorry can you repeat the question	What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell	8.0
23 of 12 is 46	Look at your paperfolding model	1.0
26	You dont sound like you believe it	1.0
	Does your model not show that	2.0
It does	When I open my model I see that theres two squares out of the six squares that have doubleshading	1.0
	Is that not what yours shows	2.0
Yes that what mine shows	Okay	1.0
	How can you tell that its 26	8.0
Miss	Yes sir	2.0
May I speak to you for a minute	Yes sir	1.0
Thank you	No Oaklee	1.0
	You get to finish	1.0
	Go for it	2.0
It would be 26	Okay rate how well you understand this paperfolding model	2.0
	Good because next week youre going to be making some drawings and folding all of this	1.0
	Should you keep these examples	1.0
Yes	Please tuck them inside your math journal and join me on the  for snack and	1.0
	Thank you for being ready and patient reSSy I appreciate it	1.0
	I feel like I have so many things to go  technology and SS that	1.0
	Lets just renew our learning intention like we did together please	2.0
Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with some unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	Thats so wordy	1.0
	I want you to think for a minute what does this mean that you actuSSy are doing today	1.0
	I want you to think about why are you doing that	1.0
	Whats the point of being able to do this	9.0
	Just to let you know Mrs Sharp  taught this yesterday and just discovered SS the benefits so this is day two of this	1.0
	When you have an idea of what this actuSSy means youre doing and why youve thought through the why do a standup hand up pair up	1.0
	30 seconds your response together	1.0
	Ready do	2.0
She knows how to do both and Im going to make her teach me	Lets hear the reason that we would add and subtract fractions with a different denominator	9.0
	Why do we have to be able to do that	9.0
	Max	2.0
Its because we need a	Whats the reason to learning this	9.0
	Were adding and subtracting fractions that have different denominators why do you need to be able to do that	9.0
	Who was your partner	1.0
Cooper and Sheila	Okay so maybe Cooper and Sheila can help give an idea here	3.0
	No just give an idea	1.0
Because were learning this so which is can kind of	Well I dont know	1.0
	Why is it in the real world that we would need to do this	9.0
Like	Are SS fractions that we add and subtract going to have the same common denominators	2.0
No	Now were SS shaking our heads	1.0
	Why would you want to be able to add like this the wording of this needs to be modified okay	2.0
	It definitely needs to be modified but why do you have to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	9.0
	Ive just given you a hint Marcus	1.0
	Why	9.0
	We just now SS said not SS fractions that were adding and subtracting have the same denominators so why do you have to find a common denominator	9.0
So it is easier to just subtract them	What do you guys think of his thinking	3.0
	I think there are some people who kinda going  and some people going yes	1.0
	You see somebody doing this that means that they probably dont agree with part of that right	2.0
	Why do you not necessarily totSSy agree with that Hunter	3.0
I lost it	What	2.0
I lost my answer	I think you need to talk with your teams again	2.0
	Youre going to talk at your teams	2.0
	What is the relMaureennce of learning this why do we want to learn this	9.0
	Be prepared to share your answer a whole group	1.0
	Kids I like the way the room has quieted down to an natural quiet when you were done thank you	1.0
	Marcus are you better prepared to answer this now	2.0
	SS right Marcus is going to explain the relMaureennce of this to us	8.0
We said that my team thinks that it be easier to add and subtract it when you have a common denominator with it	Repeat that for Marcuss thinking	2.0
	I hear you saying that its easier	5.0
	Im wondering if it is only easier or do you have to have a common denominator to add and subtract fractions	1.0
	What do you think	8.0
	Does that just make it easier or do you have to have a common denominator to add and subtract fractions	2.0
	Talk with your face partner partner B goes first	2.0
	Hunter is it just easier or do you have to have a common denominator	8.0
Its a little bit because you have to have a common denominator	This should say Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fraction problems	1.0
	BasicSSy you have to be able to add and subtract fractions that have different denominators	1.0
	Do you have to find a common denominator and do we need to go back and review what common means	1.0
	Lets look at this slide	1.0
	Common read it with me	2.0
Finding fractions that are the same	I said think about when we say we have something in common like Nikeel and I were talking this morning about our pets and what was going on with your dog	8.0
He was sleeping on me and I had to get up and it was super hard	How big is your dog	8.0
	Hes as big as you are practicSSy right	2.0
Yes	Hes this huge dog and I said to him Oh my gosh the same thing happened to me last night because the princess wanted to just sit on my chest SS night and Im like Gee I love you but mummy has to go do some work and I could take the sevenpound cat off me and go get my work done	1.0
	It was more a mental guilt for me but did we have that in common that our pets wanted to sleep with us	2.0
Yes	Do we have to have that in common	2.0
No	Some of you are going This doesnt relate to me at SS but for fractions we keep saying they have to have this common denominator that means that denominator has to be	8.0
Equal	I like the way you keep going to equal or another word would that will be	8.0
Equivalent	Same or Equivalent	5.0
	The common denominator do you have to have a common denominator	2.0
	Were going to come back to this conversation at the end of the lesson	1.0
	SS right	1.0
	After youve worked with it a little more	1.0
	The other word that we thought you might need to make sure you understand is unlike	1.0
	Those three words	1.0
	Lets read what it says about unlike ready go	2.0
For fractions to be unlike they have to have different numbers in the denominator	Here is the graphic they chose youll see how this is showing fractions and this with a diagram to show that	1.0
	Talk with your partner about how these are unlike fractions	8.0
	Its partner As turn to talk first face partners	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	How are those two fractions unlike	8.0
	Royce	2.0
They have different denominators and if you look on the picture theyre different size box for onesixth and onetwelfth	What do you guys think he was his thinking	3.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I like the way you noticed they dont have the same denominator and I like the way you related it to our illustration	1.0
	Thats why theyre unlike and thats why we keep talking about we want a denominator thats the same	1.0
	Lets go back then to the success criteria	1.0
	Lets read this	2.0
I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	Show me a gesture that shows the equivalent fractions	8.0
	Good everybody is showing me equals	1.0
	You have to be able to use a multiplication rule show me a gesture for multiplication rule maybe	8.0
	Yes the multiplication rule will help us get those equivalent fractions	1.0
	Thats what were doing today	1.0
	SS right	1.0
	Lets go back yesterday we were doing some slate with benchmarks	1.0
	Think for a minute benchmarks were zero onehalf and onewhole	1.0
	When we were estimating and we were trying to decide which benchmark our answer was closest to we were estimating like what do we think the whole answer is going to be when we were saying which benchmark is our answer closest to	1.0
	SS right	1.0
	Weve been through SS of these so we are going to do a couple more to refresh our memories	1.0
	I saw a lot of people yesterday write zero onehalf and one on their slate	1.0
	Then well align them	1.0
	Im trying to decide just like thats what would be closest to	1.0
	Can we look at this one	1.0
	Onefourth minus onetwelfth	1.0
	Which benchmark is that closest to	8.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You are going to talk to your face partner its partner Bs turn to explain why this is what they said	9.0
	Partner B ready go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	River can you explain to us how you got zero	8.0
I got zero because I know onefourth is equivalent to threetwelfths and it would equal zero anyway because onefourth is smSS and threetwelfths is also smSS so if you round its going to be anywhere close to zero	Who has a different way of explaining that	3.0
	How they knew their answer	8.0
	Cooper	2.0
What me and Nikeel said we said that onefourth is between zero and onehalf then if youre subtracting threetwelfths from that onefourth its going to be closer to zero because youre already in the half and if youre subtracting its going to be closer to zero	Thank you	1.0
	Anybody have a different way of explaining it	3.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Lets try one more	1.0
	I dont think we did this one yesterday	1.0
	One and a half minus onethird	1.0
	See some people making drawings on their slates thats a great strategy	1.0
	That helps you to process that	1.0
	Its the same benchmarks	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Again you are going to talk with your face partner gain and partner A starts to explain their thinking	8.0
Onehalf minus anything would be closer to one	Thank you	1.0
	I like the way I can see people using vocabulary	1.0
	Cooper B can you explain your thinking please	8.0
I took only a little bit more than one whole and since its over one whole	You want to show us a model	8.0
	You want to make something like fraction circles are right there	1.0
	Im lost and I need Im struggling Im trying reSSy hard  anything about what the speaker is saying but Im still lost	1.0
	Cooper do you want to approach	2.0
Yes	Maybe SS of us could try making something even make an illustration or use the fraction circles make something that proves your thinking for you	1.0
	Make something	1.0
	We saw yesterday  easy that helps to show something	1.0
	Two colors might help you in making an illustration	1.0
	Can you explain your picture or your model to your face partner and Ive lost count I think its partner	2.0
B	B	4.0
	Thank you for my helpers	1.0
	Partner B explain your model first	8.0
	Im learning so much about your understanding here its fascinating	1.0
	Lets have Cooper explain his thinking using the model youve drawn on the board	8.0
Yes	Fabulous	1.0
	Lets give him a round of applause	1.0
There is not another benchmark upon the whole so I said one	Using the word benchmark thank you for using that and drawing us that	5.0
	Thank you	2.0
	I saw a lot of good drawings that were very similar to our models which looked the same thank you very much	1.0
	Now I want you to think further that how does this strategy help us with our learning intention	1.0
	How does we using this benchmark idea help us with our learning intention	8.0
	How does that help us with this work	8.0
	When you have an idea give me a thumbs up	2.0
	I want you to keep your thumb up and if somebody doesnt have their thumb up and you have your thumb up that would be a great conversation for you to maybe help them out	2.0
	SS right	1.0
	Should two people with no thumbs up get together	2.0
No	How is that conversation going to reSSy go	8.0
	Keep your thumbs up just stand up hand up pair up and talk	1.0
	How does finding a benchmark help us in solving fractions	8.0
	Let me know	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	How many of you found out some information from your  another partner	2.0
	Go ahead	1.0
	Thats why we collaborate	1.0
	Lets hear somebodys idea of how using a benchmark help us with this learning intention	8.0
	Hunter	2.0
Me and my partner Gary said that so we were solving addition and subtraction problems that today we were solving common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions	I agree that thats what were doing and that we were kinda practicing that but Im not sure how the finding a benchmark relates into this	1.0
	How like the skill of knowing that my answer is closer to zero number one help me with this	8.0
Are we supposed to find equivalent fractions	Right I like it that youre still thinking about the learning intention	1.0
	Good job keep your ears peeled okay	2.0
	How does this help us with being able to add and subtract fractions correctly	8.0
	Charlie	2.0
Me and Paulina said its kind of like an estimate so like when youre solving and you find an equivalent fraction when you find your actual answer and you can use it to check your work and its kinda realistic	How was your answer different than what you just heard Charlie say	3.0
Its because she said it was an estimate and youre supposed to do the estimate and then find the answer and check your work but I said just to find equivalent fractions and to solve equations	Yes you were restating this but you werent thinking Oh how does this skill help me	1.0
	Theyre so related right	3.0
	We keep practicing reasonableness and making an estimate as a way of checking reasonableness	1.0
	SS right give yourselves a pat on the back this is reSSy hard word that youre doing	1.0
	Im very very proud of you thank you	1.0
	SS right	1.0
	Look back at your math journal from yesterday I think it was on page 154	1.0
	Just refresh your memory about what we were doing yesterday	1.0
	Im glad you look at that when you check your board	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I like the way I see some people are already on that page looking at it	1.0
	I want you to look at problem one the table	1.0
	Just reSSy interact with your shoulder partner and explain what you do	1.0
	Each one of you will get one of them to go through that whole process with those problems from number one	1.0
	Partner A will explain first and then partner B will explain the second	2.0
	When youre both done stand up please	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Show me how well youre feeling like you can find a common denominator using the multiplication rule	1.0
	Good	1.0
	You refreshed your memory with your partner	1.0
	Today you are going to complete the rest of the journal pages that you didnt have the opportunity to from yesterday	1.0
	If you and your partner decide to work together you say to describe	1.0
	If you and your partner feel like Im ready for an independence then you work and chat with this	1.0
	You need to finish the rest of this page and the next page	1.0
	When youre finished I have a game for you	1.0
	Ill put it up on the board and then I know some people are doing nomadic	1.0
	They can do that also	1.0
	Questions about what to do	2.0
	Charlie	2.0
Do you have assignment where  game	You and your partner are pretty much going to finish at the same time right	2.0
	Because youre either thinking and describing or working and checking so youll  partner but	1.0
	Good question	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Thanks for your stopping so quickly	1.0
	Remember yesterday we were remembering  and where were thinking about the learning we had back then	2.0
	We were like Hang on	1.0
	This is not SS brand new	1.0
	What was the little saying that we said	8.0
	Whatever you	8.0
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	How does that relate to todays work	8.0
	Lets say it again	2.0
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	You could even reverse that right	2.0
	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	1.0
	How does that relate to the days work and our learning intention this multiplication rule	8.0
	How do those relate	8.0
	I am working with somebody right now thats on problem two and they were smart	1.0
	They were using the number line for their strategy but they were like Theres not another one	1.0
	Im looking on the number line and Im supposed to come up with four and I need another one	1.0
	How does this rule Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	1.0
	relate	8.0
	Stick your thumbs up if you know how they relate	2.0
	How does that rule relate to this work today	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	If you have your thumb up and across from you theres somebody with their thumb up then you just share with your partner	2.0
	If youre the only one with your thumb up you share with your team and see if you can come to some consensus about it SS right	3.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Thank you so at this team Sheila her lights just went Oohh	1.0
	LiterSSy that was her sound	1.0
	Sheila tell everybody what you figured out	1.0
BasicSSy what youre doing is youre doing 2x24 and then 3x26t	Oh	1.0
	What were you doing there Sheila	8.0
What I was doing is basicSSy youre multiplying it by two	Youre multiplying the numerator	8.0
And the denominator by two	Okay	1.0
	I see some people agreeing	1.0
	I see some people not looking up here and I reSSy want you to notice something	1.0
	I wrote three is that okay if I wrote three instead	2.0
	If youre reSSy multiplying the same number the numerator and the denominator by the same number three thirds	1.0
	This team told me that equals one	1.0
	What do we know the rule is when you multiply a number by one	8.0
Same thing	Its the same number	5.0
	Are you changing that number	2.0
No	Show me an action that shows me the relationship between the new number and the old number	8.0
	Nice I see some people	1.0
	Yes youre going to be on the cheer squad someday because cheerleaders do that	1.0
	Yes they are equivalent	1.0
	How can you prove that to yourself	8.0
	How could you prove that SS these numbers like Hunter has one fourth three twelfths two eighths how can you prove that those are SS equivalent	8.0
	How can you prove that	8.0
	Popcorn it out whats one way you can prove it	8.0
Divide	What do you mean by that	8.0
You could see if that number Well maybe multiply that number that fraction you originSSy had to see if it got one of those fractions	We want you to play with this a little bit	1.0
	How can you prove that multiplying the top and the bottom by the original fraction still gives you an equivalent fraction	8.0
	Play with that	1.0
	How can you prove it	8.0
	You have lots of tools at your desks	1.0
	You have number lines you have fraction circles you have whiteboards you have  mathematical  you can play with	1.0
	Prove that youre coming up with an equivalent fraction	1.0
	Who has a way to prove that using the number line if they can show us	8.0
	Who has the number line method down	2.0
	Yay	1.0
	Do you two want to go up together	2.0
	Its always nice to have a partner	1.0
	Lets give them a round of applause for volunteering	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Theyre showing us the number line method	1.0
	Should you be working on your idea	2.0
No	No youre looking at their thinking	1.0
The way to do it you have the onefourth you could get a straight line then look down	Can you just show us that straight idea	2.0
	Theres a ruler in that drawer to your left	1.0
	Right there	1.0
	Open till the top drawer	1.0
	Its the top drawer to your left and on the right hand side of the ruler	1.0
	Do you see it	2.0
	Its even transparent I think or not	1.0
	Never mind you found the ruler	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Show us that straight line	1.0
This part on the four is lined up with the eight and	How do you know then	8.0
	Because they are lined up on the same place on the number line arent they	2.0
	They are still equal	1.0
	Lets give them a round of applause	1.0
	Who had a different method	3.0
	Did you figure out your mathematical one	2.0
Yes	Can I save the best for last	2.0
Yes	Okay thanks	1.0
	Nadia whats your method	8.0
I used the fraction circle	Great	1.0
	Shes going to head up there	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Andy do you want to go with your partner	2.0
To get to this you would multiply a third like with the same thing on the top and the bottom by two and that would be You can see that they are equal because you have twothirds equals to four sixths because it takes four sixths to get two thirds	Thank you	1.0
	Any questions for them	2.0
	Everybody sees it	2.0
	Round of applause	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Anybody besides Breanna have another way	3.0
	SS right Breanna youre up	1.0
	Can you prove another there for us	8.0
Yes	Round of applause	1.0
	Yay	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Should we be building right now	2.0
equals to three because if you multiply if you do onefourth times two you get two eighths and if its two divided by two eighths If you switch two eighths with a half you get one fourth	Think of what question you want to ask them	1.0
	Hes got a great picture	1.0
	Hes got some great explanation but where are you confused because everybodys looking at me	1.0
	Thats how I know youre confused like Whats T going to say about this	1.0
	What question would you have for him	3.0
	I see you have times two up there	1.0
	It says one fourth equals two eighths and it says times two	1.0
	What are you trying to say there	8.0
	Im confused	1.0
One fourth multiplied by two is two eighths	When I think about onefourth times two I think about one fourth plus onefourth equals one half	5.0
	Im thinking that yellow is a fourth and another yellow is a fourth and that equals a pink	1.0
	Thats what Im thinking when I see that	1.0
	Do you want to borrow a marker	1.0
	Somebody even want to hand him a marker because theyre  right there	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Do you want to do a change Natasha	2.0
	Onefourth is equals to twofourths	1.0
	Do you want to go work on this and come back	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	You go work on this and come back	1.0
	Well go back to what we were doing	1.0
	I was just reminding you when youre multiplying whats our old saying	8.0
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	Im trying to prove to you that it equals to one and youre trying to prove to yourself okay	1.0
	Breannas going to come back to us	1.0
	Hes working through it	1.0
	Wherever youre sitting just stay there	1.0
	My friend Breanna has said to me What did you say Breanna	2.0
	Hes going to show us	1.0
	Wherever youre at	1.0
Stay there	If you need to demagnify it let me show you	1.0
	See this subtraction symbol in the final answer	2.0
Yes	Thank you	1.0
The way that I figured it out was if I divide it by two it will be onefourth multiplied by two and you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two which would equal to eight	Nice job	1.0
	What do we cSS what you just did	8.0
	Everbody think of that	1.0
	What is that strategy cSSed that were working on today	8.0
	Its part of our learning intention	1.0
	Think about it	1.0
	Say it in your hand	1.0
	Let it out	2.0
Multiplication rule	Yes multiplication rule	5.0
	Thats why I said You	1.0
	because this is the multiplication rule	1.0
	Multiplication rule is to do what	8.0
Multiply	Whatever you do to the top	8.0
You do to the bottom	Nicely done	1.0
	Stay right where youre at	1.0
	Lets give Breanna a round of applause	1.0
	You have determination	1.0
	It can be rattling to think you know what youre doing and then get up and not	1.0
	Good job not getting rattled	1.0
	Look up here please	1.0
	Think about question one	1.0
	Read it with me	2.0
Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	Think about that	1.0
	This back to what we were talking about	1.0
	Remember we said wed come back to this	1.0
	Why would it be difficult to add and subtract functions with unlike denominators	9.0
	People on the rug get a novel partner please	1.0
	People here	1.0
	Laura you can come and talk with Maureen please	2.0
	Youre going to talk with your partner	2.0
	Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	9.0
	You can start with the center screen	1.0
	It is difficult because	9.0
It is difficult because	I should thank you	1.0
	Why is it difficult Wendy	9.0
You have to use multiple strategies and to check your work and find common denominators	Okay	1.0
	I like your thinking	1.0
	I can tell you tried but its not exactly answering this question	1.0
	Lets go back to this question	1.0
	Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	9.0
	Elijah	2.0
Its a less efficient way with different denominators as well because you have to get fraction circles and actuSSy work a long time to actuSSy be able to figure out the right answer	Harriet you want to connect	3.0
Id like to add theyre different sizes so you have one fourths plus three sixths threesixths is going to be way bigger than onefourth	This is tricky to explain	1.0
	It is tricky to explain	1.0
	I was thinking when I wanted to explain it Id say Its like theyre in two different units	1.0
	You know how you talked about miles and kilometers	2.0
	Theyre both units of measurement but theyre different measuring standards	1.0
	Kilometer is a different metric and then theres US standard You have to put them in the same form in order to add and subtract with them so that theyre in the same unit	1.0
	I dont know	1.0
	Thats a tricky one to explain	1.0
	Lets think about number two	1.0
	Read it with me	2.0
Easy	You need to think of one way you can do this	1.0
	Think about our learning intention	1.0
	That might be the way that you could talk about If you shared first the last time you share second this time	1.0
Ready go	Whats one way to find a common denominator Clay	8.0
	I have people checked out	1.0
	They have their math journals put away and their snacks ready to go	1.0
	Are we for snack time if were not finished with math	1.0
No	No we are not	1.0
	What did we practice today and yesterday to help us find a common denominator Hazel	8.0
The multiplication rule	Which is	8.0
Which is multiplication	Right	1.0
	Multiply what	8.0
Multiply	The numerator	8.0
And denominator	By	8.0
By	The same number	1.0
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	Yes whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	5.0
	Thank you Hazel	1.0
	You did a good job	1.0
	Rate yourself on how well you can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	If you did not finish these journal pages do you think you should take it at home and do it for homework	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Is it punishment	1.0
No	No	1.0
	Its to help you get ready for the next day	1.0
	Im going to save the home link for Monday	1.0
	Just get this back in our heads	1.0
	Some of you are putting your math journal in your desks some of you are putting it in your homework folders	1.0
	If you dont understand what the lesson was about should you go back and look at it	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Thank you for your hard work	1.0
	We can have a snack now	1.0
We have to use a ruler	Number five	8.0
It looks great	Okay	1.0
	Tell me what youve done	8.0
	Right	1.0
	Its just the same issue as  by doing that	1.0
	Sometimes that	1.0
	Remember the whole idea is we want it to equal zero	1.0
	Well thats a zero	2.0
	Thats a six that will be zero and well	1.0
	Cool	1.0
	What does the table do to get that gauge	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	You plug in the 05	1.0
Thats the yintercept	How are you guys doing	2.0
	Do you have any questions	2.0
Were doing pretty good	All right	1.0
Do we need to put this back into the	No	1.0
	I dont think its asked you to do that	1.0
	Right	1.0
Yes	How are you going to find the vertex then	8.0
b2a	Way to go	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Its called complete	1.0
	Now you actually dont have to convert the form	1.0
	Theres a way of finding all the data you need	1.0
	Its a great exercise too	1.0
	Its really not	1.0
	What do we call the	8.0
	Why is it called that	9.0
It gives you x	Right it can tell us what the xintercept is	5.0
	Whats always true about an xintercept is	8.0
	If Im multiplying something together and my answer has to be  what has to be true about at least one of the things Im multiplying	8.0
	My answer is zero  how do I get zero	8.0
	One of them has to be zero	1.0
	If this  value has a zero and those are the two things Im multiplying	1.0
	What would make that equal to zero	8.0
	The whole thing	2.0
Its probably three	What would make that	8.0
Its b2a	of symmetry	1.0
	How do I find the middle of two numbers	8.0
like two	Perfect	1.0
	Now youve got the xvalue of the	1.0
	If you have the xvalue how do you find the one	8.0
	There you go	1.0
	Number four	1.0
	All right so if you want to  its all multiplied out	1.0
	Its all individual numbers theres no multiplication	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Theres no  If I asked you to multiply 2 x 3 x 4 how would you	8.0
	multiply 2 x 3 x 4	1.0
	Does it matter if I do that first and then multiply it by 10 or multiply those and then multiply that one	2.0
No	It still doesnt matter	1.0
	You just got to make sure you multiply them all	1.0
	Now what is the answer to this	8.0
	Whats 2 x 3	8.0
Six	Times four	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Now what I dont know Trish is if what you were saying was do you have to multiply that times that and that times that	2.0
	They already did that	1.0
	You could multiply the two final  and then multiply	1.0
If I  all of them	Well that would be like to get my answer do I do 2 x 4 and get a	1.0
Yes	2 x 3 and get 6 6 x 8 and the answer is 48	2.0
	Get your answer for that and then multiply it by the	1.0
	Y is	8.0
	Nomial is	8.0
	so if weve got two terms and two terms those are each called	1.0
	What shape does this graph	8.0
	The shape is a parabol	1.0
	Is it going to have a min or a max	2.0
	Because	8.0
	Then how do you know its racing down into a negative	8.0
	A value is negative	1.0
	Coefficient times quadratic term is negative	1.0
	When it says the highest point what is it asking for with regard to that	8.0
	The vertex	1.0
	How can I find the vertex of a standard form like that	8.0
I have zero idea	You could but looking at that I dont really like any of those numbers	1.0
	You could	1.0
	Its just going to be a little tricky with those kind of numbers	1.0
	Three numbers are a quadratic form	1.0
	The quadratic formula the first two and that is the very center	1.0
	Whats the quadratic form	8.0
	I add to get to that and I subtract to get to that	1.0
	Hey guys this is the only email that I have and all it says here is that theres police activities but its affecting all these schools	1.0
	How do you find the xintercepts is what youre saying or the x value of the vertex	8.0
I think we did a good job	Everybody should probably do that because given the numbers I want to make sure everybody is on track	1.0
	We know that the symmetry is negative five	1.0
I have one going to be 4x squared plus 32x 148	It s like it s down here because if you got minus 30 whatever	1.0
	Whats the equation	8.0
	What equation are you getting	8.0
4x232x48n	Did you get the x value correct	2.0
I multiplied  and then I multiplied by	Ladies and gentlemen let s see if we can finish it up in the next few minutes five minutes	1.0
	If we think about the  and  and then weve got  and this distance is	8.0
	How high is the fence	8.0
I got  points	For that	1.0
Yes	Is the trajectory going to do that or is it going to do that	8.0
Thats	What value is that  and is that	8.0
	Its x equals that	1.0
Can you plug it in into	Give it another try	1.0
Were distributing	All right coaches you should be getting that point where you checking answers wrapping up this activities in the next couple of minutes	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen so go ahead and close your student journal	1.0
	You can go put it away and come back to your desks	1.0
	All right books and journals put away	1.0
	No you can use the cards	1.0
	Well use them for the next not quite the next but the next after the next	1.0
	Since this is the first time that youre in your teams lets do a little team building activity	1.0
	What I have up here are chips with a question on one side and so the question side goes down and well do two rounds	1.0
	Doing two rounds with kind of a limited number of chips might mean you get the same question again which means come up with a new and answer and so what well do is have person number one come up	1.0
	Theyll grab a chip just take it back to your desk	1.0
	Youll read it and then person number two will do the first answer then three four and back to number one	1.0
	The person with the chip is the last one to actually answer it	1.0
	When theyre done answering it they hand it to person number two person number two puts it back down here face down grabs another one and goes back and you repeat that process	1.0
	The person with the chip just reads the question everybody else answers	1.0
	They answer pass the chip and you take turns	1.0
	Well do two rounds so each person will get up twice to grab a chip	1.0
	Any questions	2.0
	All right person number one	1.0
That sucks	All right Thomas you get it done	2.0
whats your favorite word	Go ahead and pick up this Id like you to do problems five and six first and factor it	1.0
the Y	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	As youll see some of the teams have already picked up the blue set of practice problems	1.0
	On that blue set of practice problems I want you to start with problems five and six	1.0
	Five and six	1.0
	Start	1.0
So 2 52 you get 2254 I get	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen eyes of upfront please	1.0
I dont like this class	So as I mentioned about the test next week the level four question can draw Well actually probably even the level three given the fact were really focusing on linear and quadratics	1.0
	One of those skills is remembering how to factor	1.0
	A Lot of you were dong that as part of those other activities which is great but I wanted to make sure we started this worksheet since our time is limited	1.0
	Hopefully its limited and we get to go at 224 right	2.0
Yes	So this is a quadratic	1.0
	What form is this in	8.0
Standard	Standard	4.0
	When we factor the standard form equation what do we call that form	8.0
Standard form	No this is standard so when we factor it I used to call it factor form but the big idea has a different name for it	5.0
Standard	Youre getting the right idea Chloe	1.0
Right	All right	1.0
	Ill check that	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
is so quiet	So if were in standard form and we factor it I used to call it factor form but what does it really tell us	8.0
	Whats the thing that factor form tells us	8.0
That it intercepts	X intercepts so we want to call it	8.0
Intercept form	Intercept form	4.0
	Ladies and gentlemen I see some people not working on five and six	1.0
	So if you werent listening to me you dont know youre supposed to start with five and six	1.0
	Were starting with this so that you get some practice refreshing your memory	1.0
	How do you factor it when A is one	8.0
	How do you factor it when A is not one	8.0
	Now I taught my classes factoring by grouping for this	1.0
	That may be what you have	1.0
	You might want to be referring to your math two toolkit I believe it would be in essential outcome too that you would find a toolkit on how you factored when the A value is something other than one	1.0
	So I want you to start with five and six	1.0
	When you feel confident about those two then move on to problem number one two three and four	1.0
Completing this	Yes but were not going to complete the square of it	5.0
	I really like what you did	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You did factor by grouping basically although thered be a plus in between there	1.0
	Thats the only thing	1.0
that would take longer to do	Okay	1.0
	Well well compromise	1.0
and then you have X  5	Do one we really need	1.0
Look at this one	This is five and six	1.0
Yes	Because its symmetrical so I have to add that much and subtract that much to find the point on either side of that	1.0
	So Ive got that but then I add the same amount subtract  that gives you my symmetry	1.0
	Thats	1.0
I have a negative	Right	1.0
	So that whole thing tells me	1.0
	So that	1.0
	I have my vertex right here	1.0
	I got  the X values and then I plug that into my function	1.0
	This is not only the equation of the line of symmetry its also the X value	1.0
	If I know X how do I find Y	8.0
Point it towards the X	You plug it in	1.0
	This is my function notation	1.0
	I plug that in the equation	1.0
Got it	Okay	1.0
just going to point it in there	Did you let them out	2.0
	We all call it access	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Well the good news is you dont have to	1.0
Were staying  math today	Whoa	1.0
	Whoa	1.0
	Whoa	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Do you know why you did that	9.0
	So this is more the kind of strategy for this one	1.0
Negative one over 12	Let me figure out a couple of sample problems and Ill put them up	1.0
Next one	Thats what I was hoping to do	1.0
Now were going to do the	but I could check just to see if its	1.0
We keep it in fraction	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen we get to stay together until three	1.0
Im supposed to know	Because	1.0
Can we just like  homework	Well heres my plan	1.0
Do we have time to work	I do want you to know how to factor these two things	1.0
	So if you could at least give me as best attention as you can at this time of day for going through these two examples	1.0
	Then lets just say I want you to go back and do five and six on that page and one more so youll do half of the problems that are on that blue and then you can take the rest of the time to work on toolkit and homework and that sort of thing and get those questions answered	1.0
	Does that sound reasonable	2.0
	Is that okay	2.0
Anyone	Well I definitely want to go over this you may want to take notes with this	1.0
No way	You may already have this stuff in your toolkit and you just need the refresher	1.0
	So again Im in standard form	1.0
I want Taco Bell	and the instructions are to factor	1.0
	So if my Avalue is one theres one strategy and if my Avalue is something other than one Ive got a different strategy	1.0
	So lets start with this one	1.0
	My Avalue is one whats my B value	8.0
Three	Three so thats the coefficient of the linear term	5.0
	This is the coefficient of the quadratic term	1.0
	I do want you to know the vocabulary	1.0
	Ten is called a	8.0
Yintercept	It is the yintercept	5.0
	It is my Cvalue but in terms of like this is a quadratic term this is a linear term this is a Yes its a constant	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Its always going to be 10	1.0
	It doesnt change	1.0
	The X that changes things but this guy doesnt change	1.0
	Its called the constant	1.0
	What Im hoping is somewhere in your memory is this phrase factors of C What is C in this case	8.0
Ten	Ten	4.0
	What are the factors of 10	8.0
Ten	Were being systematic	1.0
One two	Its one and	8.0
Five	Or two and	8.0
Five	Or three	2.0
No	Or four	8.0
	Or five	8.0
Two	Fives already in my list so I know I can stop	1.0
	Now having done that notice Im just being very systematic about it	1.0
	Now I have a second set	1.0
	Whats different about that set	8.0
There has to be a multiple	My second set of factors of C	1.0
It has that	Okay	1.0
	I havent gotten to that part yet	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ill have one set of factors and then I change the signs of everything	1.0
	I might have a negative and a positive and then I change it to positive and negative but Ill have two sets to be complete	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So factors of C and then the next part that adds to B	1.0
	So my Bvalue is	8.0
Three	Three does one of those combination add to three	2.0
Yes	Which one	8.0
Five and negative two	But what would that have to mean	8.0
	Do I have any factors of C that add up to B	2.0
No	What does that mean I have to use	8.0
Quadratic formula	The quadratic formula	5.0
	That means Ive got to use this to find my X intercepts	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Now what would I just simply have to change in this so that I do have a factor	8.0
	If I change this guy to a negative so factors of negative 10	1.0
	Lets see if theres any of those that add up to three	1.0
	Negative one and 10	1.0
	Negative two and five three four and five is not in there	1.0
	My opposite set one and negative ten two and negative five	1.0
	Does one of those add up to three	2.0
Negative two and five	Okay	1.0
	In this case once I found those Ive actually found my two factors	1.0
	Whats always true about Xintercepts my two ordered pairs whats always true about an Xintercept	8.0
The Y is zero	Y is zero	4.0
	So this has to be zero here and Im multiplying two things together and my answer is zero what does one of them have to be	8.0
Zero	One of those has to be a zero	5.0
	So the work I show is to say X minus two oops	1.0
	I dont want it in parentheses	1.0
	sorry	1.0
	Either X minus two equals zero or X plus five equals zero	1.0
	So add two to both sides subtract five and those are my two Xintercepts	1.0
	Think about this way if I put it on here Ive got a positive two and a one two three four five did I do it wrong	2.0
	Yes minus five	1.0
	Right	1.0
Yes	Minus five and two	1.0
	So theres my Xintercepts	1.0
	Whats the line of symmetry going to be then	8.0
	How do I find the line of symmetry	8.0
You add those two together	Right because the line of symmetry has to be right in the middle and thats really why I graphed it	1.0
	Come on Chandler	1.0
	Because when I look at that I get an idea Oh well my line of symmetry does have to be in the middle	1.0
	how do I find the middle of anything	8.0
	Add them up divide by two so negative three halves	1.0
	Right here theres my line of symmetry	1.0
	The equation for that line is what I just found	1.0
	My vertex has to be on that thats also the Xvalue of my vertex	1.0
	If I know X how do I find Y	8.0
	Plug it into either one of those	1.0
	Lets do this one because it looks like the math might be easier	1.0
	Y is going to be negative 15 minus two negative 15 plus five	1.0
negative 10 you add that to one	That cant be right	1.0
	What did I do wrong	8.0
	Negative three halves oh this would be	1.0
If its negative	All right just finish that work for tomorrow	1.0
I was going to	Spencer can you please read our learning target for today	2.0
I can write numbers with decimals in expanded form	All right	1.0
	I ask you to also get out your whiteboard and whiteboard markers	1.0
	I want you on your whiteboard to please write the number 342 in expanded	1.0
	form	9.0
		1.0
	Take on another 30 seconds	1.0
	Show your purple partner and with your purple partner I want you to hifive if you both agree and talk until you do agree	3.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	If I call your name if you could come up and stand right here and show your board	2.0
	Show me first please	2.0
	Stephanie	2.0
	Quick	1.0
	Why do you think think first dont talk	1.0
	Why do you think I have these two at the front there right now	9.0
	Rylan	2.0
Because they both did it	All right use my thumbs please	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I agree	1.0
	They both did it right but they both did it differently	1.0
	Kendall can you please explain your thinking to us	8.0
What I did was three	Im going to stop you	1.0
	Dont start with what thats the question word	1.0
	Start with I	1.0
	You are the subject	1.0
I did was	I see	1.0
	Kendall why did you	9.0
Because you said 342 so I	Your three is in what place	8.0
On hundreds place	Stephanie explain it	8.0
	Where are our eyes right now	2.0
300 plus 40 is 340 plus 2 is 342	But why did you split it apart like that	9.0
	Why 300	9.0
Because if you take away 42 from 342	The value of the numbers	1.0
	300 is the value	1.0
	Stephanies was the most popular way only a couple of you thought this way but they both are correct	1.0
	Thank you very much	1.0
	Today we are going to be doing the exact same thing that most of you did correctly but were going to be doing it with decimals	1.0
	The reason we started with the whole numbers I want to show you that you understand this already	1.0
	You understand how to do this and decimals do not change the understanding	1.0
	Can we please read our success criteria Sloane	2.0
I can write numbers with decimals in expanded form	Thats technically our target which I think we read already	1.0
	Please read the success I know I understand	2.0
Some of the standard innovation  expressed in decimals and where it is practiced	Were going to be talking about the different ways we can use the expanded form	1.0
	Open your Chromebooks right now and those who are nearpodcom	1.0
	The web address is right here	1.0
	Once you get in there you can put in our code for our lesson today	1.0
	Its the same number that you use to get in its that number  so pull it out all your login information is in your planner	1.0
All right	Yes please	1.0
	If your neighbor needs help please feel free to help them	1.0
No	When you are on the correct page it should be red and it should say decimals in many forms	1.0
	Its your number Lisa	1.0
	Its not  Its the number	1.0
	Its your tool so go look at it	1.0
	What kind of Once you get to the Welcome to this session you are going to write your name	1.0
	Just your regular name	1.0
	Nothing fancy nothing silly just your regular name	1.0
	Show me thumbs up if youre ready	2.0
	Yes Stella	2.0
How come if you	I dont want to see anybody on any other screen other than the red one	1.0
	Thank you very much boys and girls for your patience	1.0
	Lets just have a could more of people	1.0
	While we wait for these last couple of people why dont you just try to write one and thirteen hundredths	1.0
	First just write that number on your whiteboards	1.0
	One and thirteen hundredths	1.0
	My friends who are still logging in keep logging in	1.0
	One and thirteen hundredths	1.0
	One and thirteen hundredths	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	Now with your purple partner I want you to see if you could write that in expanded form applying the knowledge of how to write a normal expanded form number in expanded form	1.0
	Work with your shoulder or your partner	2.0
	Zoe  if this thing stops moving lets just train off	1.0
	Just press the power button	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	Now whats your answer	8.0
	Sure	1.0
	Thats why we put it in your	1.0
	Thats where your  is supposed to be	1.0
	I dont know what  Please put in your number	1.0
	80 value something and there is a number	1.0
	Thats fine	1.0
	What did you type that	1.0
	Because thats the log in	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Show me what youve got what you and your partner decided	1.0
	Santiago will you stand up in front and share with the class what was your thinking	8.0
We did 1 plus 010 plus 03 and got 113 hundredths	Not too many people have what Santiago has	1.0
	When youre looking at expanded form you are really thinking what is the value of this number and writing it with the value by itself	1.0
	Now Lets try 23 and 0412	1.0
	Just write that by itself on your whiteboard	1.0
	23 and 0412	1.0
What were you saying again	23 and 0412	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	I only asked for you to write that number	1.0
	Now with your partner First you need to	1.0
	All right boys and girls Im going to stop you	1.0
	I think you are all in	1.0
	Are you here with the code and everything	2.0
	No not yet keep working	1.0
	Keep working	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	Boys and girls when you find a decimal its the exact same thing so same strategy same everything is synonymous	1.0
	The original number was 23 and 0423	1.0
	Most of the class did a great job of writing that	1.0
	When we write an expanded form we look at the value of each number whats the value of the two	8.0
	Its in the tenths place and theres two tenths so thats what	8.0
10 20	Class lets try that again	2.0
10 20	If Im writing the most basic expanded form thats the value	1.0
	A lot of you are keeping that 23 together	1.0
	Thats not expanded form	1.0
	Expanded form is taking the value of each number and adding them together	1.0
	Its taking this number and expanding it	1.0
	Can everyone put their hands together like this	2.0
	Show me expand your hands what does that look like	8.0
	When our hand is bigger	1.0
	Expanded forms of numbers is taking this and making it bigger	1.0
	The purpose of that Ethan is it shows that you understand the value of each number what each number actually means	1.0
	Whats the value of the three now	8.0
Three	Say it if you know	8.0
Three	Just because were in our decimal side doesnt change what we do	1.0
	What place is this four in	8.0
Tenths	Tenths	4.0
	The value is four tenths	1.0
	What place is the one in	8.0
Hundredths	Im going to write one hundredths	5.0
	When we got bigger in our value here we add zeros at the end	1.0
	Now were getting smaller so were putting zeros between the decimal point and the number	1.0
	What place value does the two have	8.0
Thousandths	I want to hear the whole class say this once	2.0
Thousandths	Then I have nothing in my tenths nothing in my hundredths and my two in my thousandths	5.0
	Take a look at your number that you wrote which you should not have erased	1.0
	If you wrote that great job	1.0
	If you didnt we are still going to be working on that for our  lesson	1.0
	I think we are still waiting maybe for one more person	1.0
	Boys and girls I so so appreciate your patience	1.0
	I appreciate it so much	1.0
	In fact Im going to give you a green bean	1.0
	This has taken about 20 minutes just to get people logged in	1.0
	Santiago	1.0
	Thanks a lot left in here	1.0
	There should be and I dont know why  Now were going to head back and actually start our  lesson which is a little bit of review and a little bit of new	1.0
	Are we in	2.0
	Brynn were going to get started  when you join	1.0
	Im going to write this code down for you	1.0
	Youll just pop in wherever we are in our lesson	1.0
	Whats going on up here	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Now remember this was the only this is the second time Ive done Nearpod so there might be some technical things as we figure it out	1.0
	All right how do we write decimals in different ways	8.0
	Thats our purpose for today	1.0
	Were going to have to say reviewing and continuing to work with our decimals written in different ways	1.0
	Can you please read that first and remember you have it on your screen	1.0
	You actually dont have to view it here you can view it right there on a screen in front of you	1.0
	Ethan can you please read that first check	2.0
	Weve already practiced some of these	1.0
	Base 10 numerals means numbers regular numbers number names means word form	1.0
	Talk with your purple partner what are the ways weve already learned before today to write decimals	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	Andy what ways have we already learned to write decimals	8.0
	What was the last one	8.0
	Attaching the zeros to write at different points great	1.0
	Today were going to do new learning which isnt a new  theres expanded form and then were also going to be Please read this one out	2.0
Decimal numbers to real word problems	Thats the essential most important piece is we dont just do decimals in math you use decimals all of the time whether you know it or not	1.0
	I need you to make sure that you are being thoughtful in what you post	1.0
	What do you already know about reading and writing decimals	8.0
	Use pictures and words to share what you know	1.0
	Im going to give you about 30 to 45 seconds to type or whatever anything that you know about decimals	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Think about our learning so far	1.0
	Whats that learning we did the first day when we wrote the exit slip	8.0
	Think about where you might use them think about different ways to write them	1.0
	A couple of great points on there	1.0
	About 20 more seconds to share and people already shared then go ahead and read and yes I noticed some of you liking	1.0
	Thats fine	1.0
	If you agree go ahead and click the little part to show you agreed with a statement	3.0
	All right	1.0
	choose one persons statement thats different than yours that you found either interesting or that you forgot and that helped you remember and think what youre going to share with your partner	1.0
	In just a moment youre going to share somebody elses statement and why you chose it to share with them	1.0
	Youre looking at your screen right now	1.0
	Were not adding anything more youre not to add anything more	1.0
	Choose one persons statement that you find interesting that expanded your knowledge that affirmed what you knew and be ready to share with your partner	1.0
	Share with your purple partner please	2.0
	The person with the darkest shirts go first	2.0
	What was something you learned and why	9.0
	Go	2.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	One thing I noticed Kendall and Sean that you guys already know a lot about decimals	1.0
	I think these are all accurate and you already know a lot about decimals	1.0
	Lets keep going	1.0
	Where would someone need to know how to write Okay so this is applying it to the real world	1.0
	I want you to think  Youre not touching your computers	1.0
	Where in the real world would someone need to know how to read or write a decimal	8.0
	I want you to think where in the real world with you to encounter decimals	8.0
	Share with your pink partner share with your pink partner	2.0
	Now go ahead and do your idea	1.0
	Im not going to give a ton of time for the drawing	1.0
	Im literally going to give one minute	1.0
	Im putting it on my watch to hold myself accountable	1.0
	Obviously theyre not going to be beautiful	1.0
	Its hard to write with apps	1.0
	You dont have to erase it you would have kept it for me	1.0
	By the way friends if you click the T for text box that means you could type your answer	1.0
	You dont have to draw it	1.0
	You could do both	1.0
	You could draw and type	1.0
	Like if your drawing looks weird you could type a label so people know what it is	1.0
	By the way my timer just went	1.0
	All right so go ahead and submit what youve got	1.0
	Its like whos drawing just popped up there	1.0
	Its fine	1.0
	You can share with us	2.0
	What is it	8.0
Its a hospital where people can enter  pills substance that they provide	Definitely hospitals will use decimals when theyre taking measurements and different things like that	5.0
	Money great	1.0
	At the store Im seeing quite a couple of monies	1.0
	Okay were not drawing anymore	1.0
	I asked you to submit and thats it	1.0
	We should have everybodys  A lot of different situations with money	1.0
	Thats probably the most common way we use decimals	1.0
	Friends who are talking while Im talking please stop	1.0
	All right lets visit a place were going to learn how to use realworld decimals	1.0
	The next slide youre going to see a picture of a gas station	1.0
	I want you to think as you look at that gas station what are the different places you would see a decimal or encounter decimals at that gas station	8.0
	Just think first	1.0
	Remember our focus is looking for decimals	1.0
	Yes you can zoom in and zoom out but the focus is decimals	1.0
	Share with your pink partner where the different places that you might see decimals at a gas station	8.0
	Wednesday	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Today Today were going to finish up materials for the test on Wednesday	1.0
	Theres really only one big idea for the new material and several smaller ideas that well go through	1.0
	But if you recall on Friday we ended up with this weve gone and done one goround for them	1.0
	I want to revisit that to help get our minds back around this	1.0
	Now the value of being able to do this is if youve been given a graph and you have to come up with the equation or youve been given the equation and youre coming up with the graph	1.0
	At the end you should be able to put the graph and the equation side by side walk through these and make sure theyre matching	1.0
	In other words this is the way you can check your answer to make sure your graph and your equation are matching no matter which direction you go from graph to equation or equation to graph	1.0
	It becomes important to understand each of the concepts	1.0
	Weve got four so were actually going to do this as a team activity but I dont want you to move your desks just leave your desks where they are	1.0
	Person number one for example would be	1.0
Louis	Two three four	1.0
	One two three four	1.0
	It doesnt matter if you start but person number one you have the first equation	1.0
	You dont have to go first if somebody else wants to jump in there and go first	1.0
	While youre listening to the other person you need to be doublechecking to make sure theyre getting the concepts right so that by the time you have the four gorounds everybody had been reinforced in their understanding of these ideas	1.0
	All right	1.0
	How am I going to know when youre done	2.0
We stand up	Stand up	4.0
	Yes	1.0
	When your team is done and youve gone through all four of those go ahead and stand up and that will just be my way of telling that you guys are on task and are done	1.0
	It doesnt matter who starts but according to your seat number youve got that equation so go ahead and get started	1.0
	The four of you guys are talking to	1.0
	Four	1.0
	Why do you have number four	1.0
Were going to pay attention	All right	1.0
	Person number one survey your team	2.0
	Is there anything we need to talk about as a class	2.0
No	All right	1.0
	Any questions	2.0
No we dont have any questions	Brad	2.0
Were good	Were good	2.0
	Jeff	2.0
	All right anybody else have questions	2.0
I need help with	You got a question	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Is there a question	2.0
	Go ahead read	2.0
	Well take	1.0
I forgot how to do that but theres	This part right here	2.0
Yes	If its a linear equation do the ends of a line go in opposite directions or the same direction	8.0
Opposite	They go opposite so a line either goes that way and that way or that way and that way	1.0
	Now what if its a quadratic	8.0
	Its a parabola so the ends of that parabola are either pointing up or pointing down	1.0
	If its to the first degree so x to the first is a linear were doing this if its quadratic were doing this if its cubic if its quartic and it just keeps going like that right	2.0
Yes	Which one were you working on	2.0
	Were you working on this one	2.0
	Three	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Whats the degree of that one	8.0
It is three	Three	4.0
	Is that an odd or even number	8.0
Its odd	Is it going in the same or different directions	8.0
It is going in different	How do I know whether its going like that or like that	8.0
If its positive or negative	In this case this one is	8.0
It is positive	Positive	4.0
	Were looking at that leading coefficient basically itll be positive	1.0
	Is it doing this or this	8.0
Its going like that	Going like that	4.0
	Okay so if its going like that how many different directions do the cubic go	8.0
Is it three	If I draw my curve how many directions do the cubic go	8.0
Three	One two three	5.0
	Theres my direction	1.0
	All right so now read	1.0
	Now were ready to answer the question	1.0
Yes	As x goes to negative infinity so lets just say thats my xaxis so x is going in that direction where are my ys going	8.0
Id like to believe down negative	Okay	1.0
	As x goes towards negative infinity y is also going to negative infinity	1.0
	In this case as the xs get bigger and are going towards infinity my ys are going to positive infinity	1.0
Why	Thats for this particular one	1.0
Okay	All right so what youre thinking of right here is as x basically goes far left y is going down	1.0
So whats the answer	As x is moving towards negative infinity y is going to	8.0
Negative	Yes because the graph is going down like that	1.0
	If I go all the way over here as x is getting really positive what are my Y values doing	8.0
Theyre going to positive	Theyre getting really positive	5.0
	Do you have a question	2.0
No	All right	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets be on page 98 of the journal	1.0
	Open your journal	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Theres ESYELL facilities	1.0
	All the Tshirts youre choosing yellow	1.0
	Grant you didnt commit and our team decided to use that system	1.0
	So he comes and watches you give us your sentence	1.0
	All right Location Principle	1.0
	Lets see how well John can read the location principle	2.0
	Go John	2.0
Go John	I dont know	1.0
If f is a polynomial  and then n be  number such that	f of a	1.0
Im	Youre done so quickly	1.0
	All right Layla help him out	2.0
f0 and f0 then  a tleast one real zero between the digits	All right now thats kind of mathy gobbledygook	1.0
	I tried to create a picture to show what this is saying	1.0
	For example if f if this y value is greater than zero then y has to be	8.0
Positive	This is where y is positive	5.0
	Anywhere in this pink range is where y is positive	1.0
	B could be any number positive or negative the x value but the y is going to be positive so its a point somewhere in here	1.0
	Then over here theres this function where were putting A in and our answer is always going to be a negative number	1.0
	Its some number where y is negative so its somewhere down here	1.0
	Theyre not necessarily in that order or even in these quadrants they could be here and here or there or there it doesnt matter but the idea is that there is a real zero in other words one of those things thats going to be in between the x values	1.0
	B would be here and A would be there	1.0
	Somewhere in between A and B theres an X intercept	1.0
	Why do we look at all that long explanation for a simple principle about this	9.0
	Again this is about understanding relationships of graphs and equations	1.0
	If I know that I have two points like this I know that in between them there has to be an X intercept	1.0
	If I were looking at a calculator table so weve put that into our y1 field and I notice a negative y and a positive y right here next to each other just like this was talking about a positive Y and a negative Y if I notice that in a table I know somewhere in between there the y value has to be zero	1.0
	If y is zero then what I found is an xintercept	1.0
	Thats just a way graphically using a graphing calculator	1.0
	Since as you know you cant have a graphing calculator for the test were not going to spend a lot of time on this but I wanted you to start to see that idea and this one right here	1.0
	All right lets just read number one	2.0
	Melinda could you read number one	2.0
On the graph every point  because the outcomes are most n minus one for any	All right	1.0
	Whats in italics up there is important	1.0
	If I have a degree and I call that degree n so now its like this	1.0
	Whats the degree in this	8.0
Three	Probably three right	2.0
	One two three directions	1.0
	If n is three 31	8.0
Two	I have one two turning points	5.0
	Its at most two because yx3 would actually be something that looks like that and we dont really see a turning point we see a little shift happening but it doesnt really turn all the way around	1.0
	Thats why that italicized word becomes important	1.0
	If n is three I have at most n minus one or two turning points	1.0
	Any questions on that one	2.0
	Faith could you read number two please	2.0
If a polynomial approaching  n distance through zero  is graphed as exactly n minus one turning points	A zero they use that term a lot but it just simply means an	8.0
xintercept	Xintercept	4.0
	If I have three xintercepts 31 is	8.0
Two	I have exactly two turning points	5.0
	What would the degree of this likely be	8.0
Four	Four	4.0
	41 is	8.0
Three	41	8.0
Three	It has one two three turning points and this could be a one two three four five fifthdegree	1.0
	It has exactly	8.0
Six	51	8.0
Four	Four turning points so we see one two three four	5.0
	Remember the other terminology that we used because theres more than one max we would call this a local max	1.0
	Theres a maximum in this general location right in here but theres also another one over here so I got a local max here and a local max there local mins as well	1.0
	Thats how some of that vocabulary works together	1.0
	Again concepts of relating graphs and equations is together	1.0
	Next topic is something called even and odd functions	1.0
	Now this specifically is in the 38 homework thats due tonight	1.0
	The homework for 38 and three nine	1.0
	Thats one clever assignment	1.0
15 questions	15 questions thank you	1.0
	Its due tonight by midnight	1.0
	There are some problems like this that youll be working on	1.0
	First read this disclaimer right here	1.0
	Weve talked about even and odd degrees but this is about even and odd functions	1.0
	Totally different terminology so we dont want to confuse them	1.0
	The idea is if I have something called an even function its symmetric about the yaxis	1.0
	When I look at this one right here if I fold my graph over on the yaxis thatll lay right on top of the other half of it	1.0
	Thats called an even function	1.0
	An odd function is if its symmetrical about the origin	1.0
	For example on this guy right here if I could kind of break it off right here and rotate this part around 180 degrees it would lay on top of that one	1.0
	In other words I can kind of spin this on the origin symmetrical about the origin and itll lay on top of itself at some point	1.0
	Theres those two cases of an even and odd but theres also cases that neither is true	1.0
	We end up having three different answers as possibilities to a prompt that asks if its even or odd or neither	1.0
	How we test that is in the red box here	1.0
	In both cases I take my function and I plug in negative x in the place of x	1.0
	Then I see if I end up with what I started with and I started with f I put in a negative x for x but if I end up with the same thing it is an even function symmetrical about the yaxis	1.0
	For this guy I do exactly the same thing but my result is that I get basically the opposite of the original function	1.0
	So in other words all of the signs have changed from positive to negative or negative to positive	1.0
	If you want to turn in your book to page 171 theres this example but were also going over it on the board but if you want to follow it in your book	1.0
	Were going to start with this guy	1.0
	In all cases says whenever I come to the x I put a parentheses	1.0
	In other words Im going to put in a negative X in the place  Oops nothing there	1.0
	This is the idea right here	1.0
	When I see the x I just simply make parentheses and my negative x goes in there	1.0
	Thats what you see happening right here	1.0
	We just stuck that in	1.0
	Now if I do a negative times a negative times a negative I end up with a	8.0
Negative	a negative x3	5.0
	Notice how that has changed from this by putting that in	1.0
	A negative times a negative here gives me the positive 7x there	1.0
	Now I look at this and I ask myself Is there any way I can rewrite that to look like that	1.0
	It turns out notice how the signs are just simply the opposite right here	1.0
	I can rewrite this by taking that negative sign out to be like factoring a negative one	1.0
	This was my original f so its the opposite of f or the negative f	1.0
	Its an odd function its symmetrical about the origin	1.0
	How does it look for these other functions	8.0
	Again first step in the place of x I just put a parentheses and then I go and I stick in a negative x somewhere right here	1.0
	If I multiply a negative times itself four times what do I end up with	8.0
Positive	That ones two times so how does that compare with what I started with here	8.0
Its the exact same	Its the exact same thing	5.0
Yes	so that one is an even function it reflects right over the yaxis	1.0
	Then the last one that were looking at the answer is going to be neither	1.0
	When I plug this in and I multiply it by itself three times its still a negative x3	1.0
	Im not changing that plus two its right there	1.0
	When I compare these two theres no way of factoring out a negative and getting back to this	1.0
	I cant get back to this from that expression so thats neither	1.0
	It doesnt have either symmetry about the yaxis or around the origin	1.0
	Remember example four so that if you need to refer back to a model when you hit those questions on the homework assignment you can just walk through that process there	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Questions right now on that	2.0
Yeah	Yeah Bens here	2.0
So I dont have to  to do it with negative or positive	Right	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Any other question	2.0
	Thats it for 38	1.0
	Were going to leave that just one key idea that we have to get in 39	1.0
	In your journals if youd open thumbs up to 39	1.0
I know	All right if youre the hallway partner All right hallway partner	1.0
Im aware its you	Tell your window partner what a polynomial model really means	8.0
	What are they asking for here	8.0
	All right	1.0
	If Ive got reallife data whats the model going to look like	8.0
	Its in the form of an	8.0
Graph	Graph	4.0
Thats what I got	In other words were trying to find an equation that matches the data	1.0
	This is all about finding an equation	1.0
	The only skill were going to cover is example number one	1.0
	This is only in the textbook if you want to pull it out	1.0
	All right page 176 if youre going to look in your books	1.0
	All right this is a similar situation as weve done with quadratics where youve been given some information about some points that are on the quadratic and how to come up with that quadratic equations	1.0
	Only now were taking it to a cubic	1.0
	For a cubic I might just have three factors	1.0
	Now on cubic though if I ended up multiplying all of this out my leading variables should be x3	1.0
	Now there might be some numbers here and a whole bunch of stuff after it but were looking for that x3 because its a cubic function	1.0
	If you wanted to think of it as the fact that you actually have three factors because multiplying X times X times X is what would give x3	1.0
	Generically youre starting with a function thats going to have three factors and so if I look here and find my Xintercepts I can drop those right in to that red format	1.0
	To remember its an X minus K type format	1.0
	X minus negative four negative four was the actual Yintercept	1.0
	I wouldnt leave it like that I would write that as X plus four but	1.0
	you can see that the red represents the standard way of starting	1.0
	Now with these Xintercepts there are a lot of different cubics that could have those same X intercepts	1.0
	For example I could have a cubic that does that and still goes through the exact same Xintercept	1.0
	That means there has to be some sort of modifier as to whether or not its like this red one which is positive the blue one which is a negative reading coefficient so we have to find that Avalue	1.0
	To find that Avalue we have to have some other point to put in	1.0
	It may be a Yintercept or maybe its another point on the line	1.0
	For example this point might just be four	1.0
	Lets see is that negative 12	2.0
	4 6 8 10 12 14 7 negative 14	1.0
	It could be one where we have to look at a graph and go Oh you know what	1.0
	Thats right all those crosshairs of the grid so I can know with some confidence	1.0
	What do I do with that equation	8.0
	I take my Y value and put it in here and I put my X values in the place of all of those and calculate it out	1.0
	Now this particular example though theyve told us what the Yintercept is	1.0
	When I make all those X is zero it makes my calculations pretty easy	1.0
	I dont have any big numbers that I have to be working with	1.0
	The whole idea here is I plug in another point a different point it cant be an X intercept its got to be some other point that I plugin for Y and for X solve for A and then rewrite my equation	1.0
	Now when youre looking at any constructedresponse problems that have this kind of thing on the test pay close attention to the prompt	1.0
	Does it tell you what kind of form to leave your answer in	1.0
	If it doesnt tell you then leave it this way because that simple but if it says standard form you got to multiply that out and put it in standard form	1.0
	If I have or lets say its actually this way I have four I will make that a negative one half like that half	1.0
	If Im multiplying four things together how do I multiply four things together	8.0
	In whatever order you want because multiplication can go in any order but pick two things and come up with your answer	1.0
	Copy the next parts down pick two things	1.0
	Come up with your answer multiply those last two things to get your answer	1.0
	Now heres what we started class with	1.0
	Remember I told you if youre given a graph and you have to come up with the equation or youre given the equation you got to come up with the graph this is your thought process to check to see if youre getting the right answer	1.0
	Understanding this as your thought process when youre done either direction whether from graph to equation or equation to graph	1.0
	Everybody has got a book you know thats on page 176 if you need to refer to that and heres the toolkit and heres our practice problems	1.0
	Ill just get rid of the answers for right now	1.0
	All right so this is in a journal page 104	1.0
	Youve got until lets say the bell at 202 so you got to the bell at 202 to figure out the exact equations for these four to step four problems	1.0
	Then well take a break for five minutes and then do the quiz	1.0
I will Im so sorry	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen the answers to those first four are on the board	1.0
	Thats it	1.0
	I just want you to work on those first four and then you can work on the toolkit	1.0
	If youve got questions	1.0
That was a joke	All right guys	1.0
	Youve just got the two more minutes before the bell then we have a fiveminute break and then were going to start the quiz	1.0
	All right guys we need to split the desks up	1.0
	You guys will stay right where youre at but everybody here needs to move over to the wall	1.0
	All right guys lets go	1.0
	We got to get set up	1.0
	If youre in this row just move your desk one tile over beyond that tile line right here	1.0
	If youre here youll just move one tile over this way	1.0
	You guys can stay where youre at and the rest of you just go all the way over to the	1.0
All the way	Ladies and gentlemen you can use your toolkit and get that green one that you used last week	1.0
	You could use that one	1.0
	Theres no calculator no textbook no journal	1.0
	Then Byron you guys need to be all the way against the wall and you need to give Alex a little more space	1.0
	Lets get that stuff put away	1.0
	Phones need to be off and off of you so not in your pocket not in a jacket	1.0
	In your backpack	1.0
	In your backpack is fine and dandy	1.0
	Let me just get rid of those	1.0
	Dont forget to clean up your	1.0
	If youve got a microphone on your desk if you would go ahead and turn the microphone off and then put the microphone on my desk	1.0
in here should we just leave it there	No we need to put it on my desk	1.0
Thanks	Youre welcome	1.0
	Put that away	1.0
Okay	Yes	1.0
Because I dont think it was in there	Okay	1.0
Okay	Thank you Thea	1.0
Thank you	Youre welcome	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
Thank you	Youre welcome	1.0
	If you guys would scooch over a little bit further	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	Just these two things	1.0
	Everything else needs to go	1.0
	Since you guys are not in alphabetical order if you would come pick up your scantron for me	1.0
	Brad Maddy Louis Melinda Miriam Lizzie Camilla	1.0
	Leon Miriam Beckham Caden Killian Ana Antonio Julie Zane Nick	1.0
	Sienna Layla Colin Angela Noelle Jeff John Byron and Ellie	1.0
	Noah James Evie Amy Sofia	1.0
	It is 214 and you have 12 multiplechoice questions	1.0
	It might not be a bad idea to put the time at the top of the paper that youre starting at 214 and then write your finish time and figure out how long did it take you to do the 12 multiple choice	1.0
	Kind of tells you How am I going to do on Wednesday when I have 20 multiple choice	1.0
	Do I need to pick up some skills and figure out how to move a little faster or am I okay	1.0
	Yes	1.0
Are these all level two questions	Yes they are all level two type questions	5.0
	Yes	1.0
Theres no level threes	No level threes of fours on this	5.0
What time is it	It is 214	1.0
	Just because she says it doesnt mean he hears it	1.0
	That was probably the most important lesson I learned in teaching	1.0
Is what	How to not take it personal when I said something three or four times and somebody says What time is it	1.0
Yes	We all zone out every now and then	1.0
	No biggie	1.0
	Highly recommend that you show your work on this so that if you get it right you know how to do it	1.0
	If you get it wrong you know what to look at and figure out what went wrong	1.0
	Whether you do it right or do it wrong its good to show your work	1.0
	If you would go ahead and put that version on the scantron so that we just get that out of the way and have that done	1.0
	Bubble in the version	1.0
	When youre done youve go time to go ahead and either work on the online homework so you can get out computers and phones and stuff like that once youve turned in your quiz or be working on the tool kits	1.0
	Remember tool kits are due tomorrow	1.0
	Im sorry	2.0
the rest of the time	Yes if you need the rest of the time	1.0
	It turns out I think in about a halfhour everybody was done in the previous class so it actually work out fairly well	1.0
	I was happy with that	1.0
	Really quick I got to tell you how to do your assignment	1.0
Is that a hexagon	Yes an hexagon	5.0
	Hexagon we finish this right	2.0
Yes	On your page in the math journal you need three colors and it talks about coloring	1.0
	Where is the rest of this group	1.0
I dont know	Are they Mr C	1.0
Probably	Okay	1.0
	Are you a hexagon	1.0
River is a hexagon	In your math journal can I see your math journal	1.0
	Ill move all those things off your desk	1.0
	In your math journal youll be doing two pages and one of the pages youre going to need a color right here	1.0
	Youre going to do exactly what weve been working on	1.0
	Use that page to help you and then here youre going to color and it says Shade each one a different color	1.0
	So the 310s lets say Im going to do Are you guys	1.0
	Looking because if youre not looking youre not going to have a clue	1.0
	If Im doing 310s then Im going to color this like purple three long things	1.0
	Then the next one is 100th Im going to color that one green and its a box a 100th is a box	1.0
	Then the 1000th is a two so Im going to pick blue and Im going to color two ittybitty ones but they all have to be separate you cant color within another color	1.0
	Then youre going to do what we did and then yes youre going to do the same thing here youre going to pick three cards youre going to write it in one of the expanded forms and then youre going to use three different colors to show it	1.0
	Thats what youre going to do	1.0
	If you need to finish your video you can do that and then work on those two pages	1.0
	Octagons will you hand me	1.0
	Hexagons you may have your snacks	1.0
	Octagons come meet with me	1.0
	You do not need your slate you need your math book	1.0
	You need a note catcher and you need three colors I mean a pencil	1.0
	A pencil your note catcher and three colors and then come join me	1.0
Can it be permanent markers can it be markers	I dont care I have the note catcher	1.0
Whats a note catcher	I have it	1.0
to use the white ones on the wall	You mean the	1.0
Yes	9 10 11 12	1.0
	Hey quickly and quietly please	1.0
	You have three colors	1.0
	Flip them to write on	1.0
I want to be in front of this	Hey Hexagons you need to be working quietly	1.0
I already found them	Do you have your three colors	1.0
Hello	Hey Campbell youre all right	2.0
	All right every one get out your math journal	1.0
	Im going to start	1.0
I cant even go swimming when its summer	9 10 11 12	1.0
	Put them over there behind the corridor	1.0
	Where is Campbell	1.0
	Give those two to her and then give this to Catherine	1.0
	Give that to Catherine	1.0
	All right focus up	1.0
	hey five four three two one zero	1.0
	If youre in group you should be ready to listen	1.0
	If youre at your seat you should be working on your pages	1.0
Were watching the video	Okay	1.0
	Thats and not or	1.0
	Were not just going to sit there and do that	1.0
Or shit there	Okay	1.0
	Felix	1.0
Yes	Youre not helping	1.0
Okay	All right	1.0
	We are going to be ladies comparing decimals today	1.0
	In the video they showed that you that you need to start if you look at this I can use place value strategies to compare decimals to the thousands	1.0
	Pass that back to Clarissa	1.0
	I know Ill understand this and I can look at each place value starting at the 10th	1.0
	The 10th is the first one right after the decimal and then comparing it to the other number so Im looking at both of them in the 10th	1.0
	Then if one number is bigger in the 10th then thats the bigger number	1.0
	If theyre the same then you go to the 100th and you see which is bigger	1.0
	Then if theyre the same then you go to the 1000th	1.0
	As soon as one is bigger that tells you that your number is bigger	1.0
	In our note catcher the first one is 34hundredths and 248thousandths	1.0
	Im going to go around real quick and youre going to say which one is bigger and then pass this okay	1.0
	On your note catcher which one is bigger 34hundredths or 248thousandths	8.0
	Okay	1.0
248thousandths	Which ones bigger	8.0
How do you say it again	248thousandths	1.0
Zero and 34hundredths	Great so we had a mixed response	1.0
Yes	Well Daniella said it first	1.0
Yes	All right give it to Derrik	1.0
	He wants to say something	1.0
We almost forgot about that	Hey all right	1.0
	Lets listen to Derrik	1.0
Im going to change my answer	Okay	1.0
	After hearing their responses	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	All right so what are you changing it to	8.0
If you add a zero to 34000 hundredths then you get 34thousandths and that is larger than 248thousandths	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	If we look on here the number is bigger ladies in the tenths so we start in the tenths	1.0
	In the tenths what do we have	8.0
A four and a four	There we go	1.0
a three and a two	A three and a two so right there ones bigger	5.0
	Just as Derrik said we dont have to look past the tenths place because we already have something bigger	1.0
	Is the three bigger or the two bigger	8.0
Three	The three	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Campbell pass that to Gerard	1.0
I get why Campbell thought that it was 248 because the eight is bigger than the zero and the fours are the same but she probably didnt see the three and the two	Okay	1.0
	Sometimes we think of the zero and we think 248 is bigger than 34	5.0
You dont add to it you dont add to the zero	Give it to Campbell	1.0
	Hold on Campbells talking	1.0
My answer was going to be zero and 248thousandths but then remembering the video I looked a bit closer and I saw that you can make zero and 34hundredths into zero and 34thousandths	Okay	1.0
	Give it to Derrik	1.0
It was fun	Okay	1.0
	All right so the next one says which decimal is bigger	8.0
	We have to make the alligator mouth towards the bigger one so the alligator mouth is going to face which one	8.0
		4.0
	How did you know	8.0
Because the three is bigger than the two	Okay the three and the tenths	5.0
	Write down on there	1.0
	Derrik	2.0
Oops	All right	1.0
They cant hear us over here	Lets look at the next one	1.0
	Okay what decimal is bigger	8.0
	One and two tenths or Thats supposed to be 2500 so we got to move down here	1.0
	We got to move the decimal	1.0
How do you know	Okay three in the tenths is bigger than the two in the tents	1.0
	All right so lets look at the next one	1.0
	Now in this one we have a whole number so we have to start at which place	8.0
Ones	We have to start in the ones place	5.0
	Lets look at this one	1.0
is it 225	I know I said we had to change the decimal	1.0
	You probably didnt hear me on that	1.0
	Well who has the mic	1.0
I do	Okay Derrik which ones bigger	8.0
	One in 2 tenths or 25 hundredths	8.0
One in two tenths	No	1.0
	Pass it	1.0
Two in 500hundredths	Thats supposed to be 25hundredths	1.0
One in 2tenths	Just hold on	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Everybody I think except Donovan said one in 2tenths	1.0
	Donovan how come you think Give Donovan the microphone	1.0
	How come you think its 25hundredths	9.0
Well at first I thought one was in the tenths and the two was in the hundredths so thats why I thought it was two to 2500 hundredths because I thought the one was in 10th place but then I looked up at the chalkboard and then I saw that was in the ones place	You agree with the one in 2tenths	3.0
I agree with the one in 2tenths	Because theres a whole number for one and not the other that automatically makes it bigger	1.0
	Derrik	1.0
	Take the microphone	1.0
	Give it to Derrik	1.0
I think thats why it made it look like it was bigger	Yes and down here I messed up	1.0
What would it look like if there were	It looks like this up here	1.0
	Just down here I wrote it wrong	1.0
	Up here its right	1.0
I agree with Catherine but 25thousandths was my original answer before I saw the one and the ones or before Mrs Duncan said one and	Hi the Alligator mouth is going to face which way	8.0
One	One and two tenths right	5.0
	How do you know	8.0
	Because theres a whole number right	1.0
right now	All right on the last one I want you to try it on your own	1.0
	Put them in order from largest to smallest	1.0
Done	Okay and then I want to show you one other thing	1.0
Well Ill just have to decide what to do	I dont know I dont have that	1.0
No look	Wait so 10 was already one of them	1.0
	It would be one over 10	1.0
	Look and see what goes with four three	2.0
I wont put the first one down before I solve the one on my app	All right friends I want to show you	1.0
You can put a zero	You can	1.0
	You dont have to	1.0
Sauce is very	Okay	1.0
Well it	All right heres what I	1.0
Hand does	Can I show you guys something	1.0
You should say a	Can I show you something	1.0
Yes	Can I show you something	1.0
Shes talking to us	Derrik Im not sure whats happening today	1.0
	Youre really good when youre participating but when Im trying to talk Im not sure whats happening	1.0
	Hey the reason I gave you this is because this can be a tool that can help you	1.0
	If youre not sure which is bigger then you can color in	1.0
	This is why I needed you to have three different colors	1.0
	This is thirtyfour hundredths and this is my two hundred and fortyeighths	1.0
	Okay I can see this has more	1.0
	We dont have to use this	1.0
	This is a tool to help you and the interesting thing in todays math pages it doesnt have the necessary when I looked it doesnt have your practice this but this will be tonights homework	1.0
	Im not sure why this is the lesson but then they dont have a practice page in the math book	1.0
	Unless I didnt see it right	1.0
Are we doing the math test	Okay so your pages today that youre doing	1.0
If she stops on time she only has 10 minutes	You are doing pages 121 and 122	1.0
We should get that	Will somebody push stop on the record and then hand me the microphone	1.0
Maybe I dont know if Im slowly solving the problem	No	1.0
Okay	You got the right one	1.0
	Youre looking at problems in number one and thats what you came up with	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Not looking good on that	1.0
I think Ill figure it out	All right	1.0
	I think you did	1.0
Thank you	All right	1.0
	Were on page 75	1.0
	If you would page 75	1.0
Are you going to use that	All right	1.0
	Page 75	1.0
	Do you have the essential question same essential question on the top	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Weve factored quadratics and now were going to talk about factoring polynomials	1.0
	So the factored form is also called what	8.0
	What have we been calling it	8.0
Intercept form	Intercept because were finding what kinds of intercepts	8.0
Xs	Xintercepts	5.0
	Okay which are also called roots and then in the calculator theyre called	8.0
Zeros	Zeros	4.0
	Get used to the fact that we use all three terminologies for an Xintercept	1.0
	A polynomial could be as simple as this one right here or as complex as something like this one here or any of these different combinations	1.0
	What did we discover about anything that has an even power	8.0
That it increases like that or its like that it bounces	It bounces off of the	8.0
Xaxis	Xaxis	4.0
	So it either bounces off or hangs you know but	1.0
Does it touch the Xaxis	It touches yes	5.0
	It touches the Xaxis	1.0
	That is only for the even exponents	1.0
	Thats what we want to deal with today is how do we go about factoring something thats not a quadratic	8.0
	Youre going to start with matching each polynomial	1.0
	This polynomial youll match that with the graph that it goes with	1.0
	You want to use the Xintercepts of the graph and then write it in factored form	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So youre going to go from the graph to this type of expression here this type of equation	1.0
	If you have any questions as you work through it let me know have good conversations with your partner work through them same place same time everybodys working together having good conversations	1.0
	So go	1.0
how to do that	Well remember that when we did factoring by grouping we actually	1.0
	So its a different	1.0
Its pretty much	Yes	1.0
	Its probably not going to work	1.0
	Its not a skill that you can use	1.0
	Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that	1.0
I mean Ill work	Match it first because then youre going to use the Xintercepts of the graph to write it in factor form	1.0
is exactly the intercept	Yes so do any of these actually bounce off the Xaxis	2.0
No but this is	Right but what we were talking about and let me put that back up for you	1.0
How do you put your factor in there	is when I have a factor thats	1.0
When its a factor	Yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
Or theres like actually is figure out	Well youre going to first match it with the graph	1.0
What Im trying to do is Im trying to figure out the intercepts and then I can match it	But youre going to do the other way around today	1.0
But I dont like that	So in other words youre going to look at the degree and probably look at this and figure out which of these graphs goes with that	1.0
	Then youre going to use the Xintercepts to write it	1.0
	So thats the sequence today	1.0
So anything other than	In terms of the degree of the polynomial	2.0
	So the direction of this would be similar to the direction of what	8.0
If they were	A line	1.0
	If a line is going like that is this positive or negative	8.0
Positive	The degree is	8.0
Odd	One and its is an odd number	5.0
	Right	1.0
	So you know that thats odd	1.0
	Thats right	2.0
Okay	Right	1.0
	Then typically if theres one two three directions its a	1.0
call me Mongoloid Jack	So they both are Okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So with these twos do you think it would go with this	2.0
	Although because they have the Xintercept	1.0
	So what I would come to is maybe just plug in a	1.0
	Is there something thats distinct about those two	8.0
Both are negative	Yes	1.0
	What happens when its negative two	8.0
	You can probably use that ones going to be a little maybe a little quicker to figure out	1.0
Honestly its not too confusing but	Youre right	1.0
I just cannot wait to see the volcanoes on March 16 2020	Neil over here	1.0
Hello Ms	Hello	1.0
How do you factor that	Well youre going to match with the graph first and then use those Xintercepts to bring	1.0
You would just take out X	You guys are good	2.0
	Awesome	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Go ahead and do exploration two	1.0
No thanks	Its a little different	1.0
	Ill modify the instructions just a little bit	1.0
I like to talk big	Charlottes in the other class	1.0
Ill find out	Somebody did the quiz retake last time and didnt put their name on it	1.0
	I dont think its probably not	1.0
EA Strahan	Okay	1.0
	Explanation	1.0
	Theres somebody who did the quiz retake last time who didnt put their name on it	1.0
I was in	Dont worry about the A value today	1.0
	No	1.0
	Youre absolutely right	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Were not going to solve for A this day	1.0
	Yes	1.0
do like that	No	1.0
	You would have to know another point	1.0
	You can use a Xintercept to check your Xintercept	1.0
well talk about it	You use your Xintercept like when were using vertex form or something like that	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You mean in terms of putting the exponent	2.0
	How do you write that	8.0
	You use the current	1.0
No I mean how do you write it in your factor form	Just like you did here	1.0
	You found an Xintercept of two and negative one	1.0
	Yes so youre going to graph that and go find the Xintercept	1.0
What is like a	No	1.0
	Dont worry about	1.0
Ms  at question two	Yes	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So notice it says use a graphing calculator to find the Xintercepts of the graph	1.0
Will we have like a graphing calculator	You will get some strategies on graphing	1.0
	If I asked you to factor this then I would probably give you one of the factors and expect you to do division to find the quadratic and then you know how to factor	1.0
Does it have to	Yes	1.0
Well thats enough	Were just going about it from a different angle	1.0
What	Its for the recording to capture student conversation	1.0
Its like I dont	But theres a whole layer of fresh snow	1.0
	So okay	1.0
It was better than	Yes	1.0
	Thats	1.0
	Im just walking on the grass	1.0
I walk in the grass too	All right	1.0
	You guys should be finishing up the first exploration and moving on to the second one	1.0
	Make sure you read the instructions up here before you start the second	1.0
Your esophagus is like	How is it going	2.0
Your esophagus is just	There are  until we can see if theres a graphing	1.0
1015 1 of biology to me	Yes	1.0
	There are several in there	1.0
	So we have both	1.0
It is common knowledge thats why I knew it	Im pressing on	1.0
I have to do	Theres a research team at CU Boulder thats developing an app that Ms Saunderss can use to evaluate how well they encourage	1.0
Ill call you	strong student interaction and engagement	1.0
	I guess Id put it that way	1.0
	So when I upload the video it evaluates Yes	1.0
	So they develop an audio and then I get the feedback	1.0
	I havent figured out how to use the feedback yet	1.0
	Thatll be my next step	1.0
	Ive gotten as far as figuring out the technology and making recordings	1.0
	The next step is to get some value out of it	1.0
The square root of five	I mean thats totally fine if its graphed correctly	1.0
	What you can do is put both of these into Y1 and Y2 and see if they overlay each other	1.0
Yes	All right	1.0
	If you wrap up investigation two I do want you to do communicating your answers	1.0
	So go all the way through question four	1.0
I dont know how to do	I thought	1.0
The only thing that I dont understand is I got  because he told me but how would you figure it out figure out the graph with only that	So thats  another degree	1.0
	That has three directions	1.0
	So looking at these we got three cubics	1.0
	Now whats happening right there	8.0
	The Xintercept is	8.0
Three	The Yintercept is	8.0
Zero	How about over here	8.0
	What is the Yintercept	8.0
Negative one	Actually  two	1.0
What	Right	1.0
	One two	1.0
	The Yintercept	1.0
	would have to be true when I look at that cubic that cubic and that cubic what makes those  different	8.0
	That	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So that one we know matches with that but these two theres no constant	1.0
	We know that the Yintercept has to be zero	1.0
	So then the question is well how do I distinguish these two	8.0
	If I pick an X value lets say negative one	1.0
	It Looks like negative one is an Xintercept of one of them but not the other	1.0
	If I plug negative one into this and I get zero I know its going to go with that one	1.0
	If I plug in a negative one and I get a positive one value then I know it matches with that one	1.0
	You guys got that	1.0
Im so sorry I have to  because you gave it to me and	Snow day	1.0
	Thats pretty	1.0
	I drove to  about 730	1.0
I could just	my circle of drive because  on the other side of I25	1.0
His real name is Danny	No problem	1.0
	Keep coming back	1.0
I could use it for a minute like	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	Lets take that fiveminute break and then were going to get into some of the examples in the textbook	1.0
	Fiveminute break	1.0
There you are	pretty soon but  a whole lot of people out	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	I have friends that live in the North Side of Scotland and  photos  see theyre going through	1.0
Yesterday	Whats  tomorrow	1.0
My first	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen lets get back to our desks	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Here are your answers for exploration one and two	1.0
	So heres your chance to see how you did	1.0
	What is that	1.0
Whats going on	Has everybody had a chance to check exploration one	2.0
Okay	There you go Joel how you can answer number three	8.0
This is exploration two	Yes	1.0
	This is for exploration two now and the communicator answer	1.0
Three equals three	If youre done go ahead and find that section in the textbook 34	1.0
	34 probably around page 136 I think	1.0
One thirtyfive	Page 136 of the textbook	1.0
You have both X	All right	1.0
	Window partner raise your hands	2.0
	Window partner	1.0
	Whos the window partner	1.0
	Window partner	1.0
	Window partner	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Window partner read this paragraph to your  partner	1.0
Most of these involved is I think are two squares	Or the difference of	8.0
I guess I was talking	Joel okay why do you have to say things that make you	1.0
Is it that why its like	Because there was somebody	1.0
Ill draw my room right here	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen	1.0
Ill draw	Eyes upfront please	1.0
From the top	So a couple of things to pull out of this	1.0
	Some polynomials can be factored	1.0
	So for example when you were working this  in some of those division problems and there was a remainder what would that tell you about it being factorable	8.0
	Yes but if it can be factored then its going to be factored completely when I cant factor anymore basically	1.0
	Im left with unfactorable parts	1.0
	So like for example when I look at the answer down here to this first example I cant factor Z plus 3 any further	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Its totally factored and so thats where you want to keep asking that question	1.0
	Can I factor it further	2.0
	Can I factor it further	2.0
	Am I done	2.0
	Particularly now that were looking at some more complex things we want to keep asking ourselves that question	1.0
	Example 1 finding a common monomial factor which means that theres got to be Ys in every term or X is in every term or Z is in every term	1.0
	In other words were just simply going to come down and in the case of this first one we can factor out an X	1.0
	The first step in the second one we could factor out a 3Y3	1.0
	In this fourth one we could factor out a 5Z2	1.0
	The first thing we want to do is always see if theres some sort of common factor	1.0
	Thats another vocabulary term we could use and factor that out	1.0
	Notice in this case we end up with a quadratic another quadratic another quadratic No	1.0
	Thats a cubic	1.0
What about	No that is a quadratic thank you	1.0
	I dont have my glasses on	1.0
	In all of these cases after we factor out that monomial we have a quadratic so we have to use our skills for	1.0
You can use synthetic divisions	Then theres synthetic division	5.0
	Thats on that option as well	1.0
	Any questions on that example	2.0
	Thats stuff that we have been doing	1.0
	Here in the core concept are some pattern	1.0
	Again these patterns Please dont play with the mic	1.0
	Okay thatll be all	1.0
	Thanks	1.0
	Notice here that weve got the addition or the sum of two cubes or the difference of two cubes the subtraction and notice that the first step in solving those using this pattern is to write them as two cubes	1.0
	There are some problems that we can look at and we have to learn to see that those are two cubes each of those and then be able to rewrite it in that form	1.0
	Then I actually know what A and B are	1.0
	A is 3X and B is this 2 and then we just simply apply the pattern	1.0
	If we look we can see that if in the sum I keep that sign	1.0
	If its a difference I keep the subtraction sign and notice the pattern of the quadratic thats left	1.0
	Its really the same pattern just with that different sign	1.0
	See that if I was getting a sum that first term is a subtraction and so those are going to be opposite signs in that case	1.0
	We want to look for that pattern and thats just exactly whats happening here with Example 2	1.0
	Weve got to recognize that these are two cubes	1.0
	Rewrite them as cubes and then just simply apply that pattern	1.0
	Thats one skill for helping you move a little bit more quickly through the test is if you start to recognize those patterns	1.0
	Pete could you read this for me	2.0
The pattern for factoring by grouping is shown below	Weve already done factor by grouping because that was one of our skills for factoring quadratics	1.0
	Remember we would find the factors of A x C and we would split the linear term	1.0
	Then we would look for a way of factoring the first terms and the second terms	1.0
	Ill show you the example	1.0
	If we end up with a common factor here then I can pull that out as a separate factor and what am I left with	8.0
	Is the Z2  4	1.0
	Thats a valid skill for some and thats why I want to emphasize some	1.0
	Its not one that we can count on because for example what if this had been 19	8.0
	Well then I wouldnt have been able to do this type of factoring	1.0
	That is something that we could look at as a strategy but its not going to work all the time	1.0
	Factoring polynomials in quadratic form	1.0
	I want to go back to this example recognizing that this is two cubics	1.0
	Its X3 and 53	1.0
	When we get to this Example number 4 Im recognizing that I could rewrite something in a quadratic form	1.0
	For example this is the difference of two perfect squares	1.0
	Its two perfect squares	1.0
	Notice how Ive rewritten this term as a square and Ive rewritten this term as a square and then I apply the pattern that we learned with quadratics the difference of two squares	1.0
	Well thats my A and my B and so I factor those but then I have to ask myself can I factor this	1.0
	Can I factor that	2.0
	Well this ends up being another difference of two squares	1.0
	Thats a perfect square and thats a perfect square so I could factor those	1.0
	This second example might be a little bit trickier for us to see	1.0
	We look at this and at first we can find a common factor and so remember thats always the question that we have to ask	1.0
	Is there a common factor I can pull out	8.0
	When I look at this how do I go from here to here	8.0
	I feel like they left out a little intermediate step	1.0
We could split the term	How can I rewrite this as a quadratic	8.0
	In other words a quadratic has something squared	1.0
	How can I take this P6 and rewrite it as something squared	8.0
	What would have to go here	8.0
	This is the reverse of our exponent properties	1.0
	Im going to put P Whatever I do with this whats a power to a power	8.0
	What do I have to do with those two exponents	8.0
You multiply them	I have to multiply them	5.0
	What times two is going to give me six	8.0
	Then notice its as if thats X and thats X	1.0
Do they cancel	No	1.0
	No they dont cancel	5.0
	Its as if this is X2  5X  6	1.0
Okay	What are the factors of six that add up to five	8.0
Three and two	Thatll multiply to that then theyll add to that so now if I understand that X is really P3	1.0
You can use it to put it back down	Thats whats missing right here is to be able to see that this could be written as a quadratic that I know how to factor because these P3s are here and I can think about them as if they were Xs and I know how to factor that but really the Xs are P3 so I end up rewriting it in this form	1.0
	Here again theres something new to recognize	1.0
	Ive got to be able to look at something like this and go Thats a quadratic	1.0
	Yes Joel	2.0
Joel 3P2 is that just transferred down because its not in the quadratic	Right because my X2 here is really P3	1.0
Other than the one on the outside theyre always	Yes	1.0
	Yes you just copy that down yes because we already factored that out	1.0
	Then of course I should I ask myself can this be factored	1.0
	Can that be factored	2.0
	Theres another new skill is being able to look at something a little more complex and recognize that I can factor it similarly as I did with quadratics	1.0
	Pete	2.0
I cant factor after Exploration 2	All right	1.0
	Well get there	1.0
	From Exploration 2	2.0
	Did you put it in the calculator and find the zeros	2.0
Im supposed to do that	Yes that was the instruction use your graph and calculator to find the X intercepts write your factor form that way	1.0
	Yes it was a little bit shorter way of doing it	1.0
	The factors theorem hallway partners your turn to read about the factor theorem	1.0
	Read it slow enough that youre understanding it as you read it as well	1.0
	Hallway partner you go ahead and do the reading	2.0
	Lets make sure were getting the big idea here	1.0
	If I can take something like that purple sheet that you worked on you did some divisions	1.0
	If I can divide it by something and my remainder is zero then this has to be a factor of it	1.0
	Its almost like saying if I have 12   3  4 and whats my remainder	8.0
	12   3  4 with a remainder of	8.0
Two	Zero that means that is a factor of that	1.0
	Now what if I did 12   5	8.0
Two with a remainder of two	Two with a remainder of two	4.0
	Is 5 a factor of 12	2.0
No	No thats all this is saying in our complex way of looking at polynomials right now	5.0
	If I end up with a remainder of zero then whatever Ive divided by has to be a factor	1.0
	Were going to be looking for that as well	1.0
	Now that you know how to divide polynomials or were working on mastering that if Im given a potential factor of something then I should be able to divide that into that polynomial and find out if the remainder is zero or not	1.0
	The other way of doing it well whats always true of an X intercept	8.0
Y  0	Y  0	4.0
	If I plug in two and why would I be plugging in two	9.0
Theres	Remember that the form is X  K that means K is two in this case	1.0
	If I plug two in what should I get for my answer if it was an X intercept	8.0
	It doesnt equal zero that is not a factor Joel	2.0
I have a question	Is it on task	2.0
Yes sort of sort of sort of sort of	I figured it wasnt going to be a direct solid yes	1.0
It just goes	You mean it doesnt	2.0
It has no curve it just	It has no min or max its got a point of inflection	1.0
	Thats what thats called where it stops	1.0
Isnt that the origin	What	2.0
Wouldnt that be the origin for that	I dont know if its for that one it could be any place	1.0
Except for that it would be if I	Hes talking about if I have I cubic that does this where it does have mins and maxes it just has a point of inflection	1.0
It looks like an undefined slope	Ill have to look at that	1.0
Its confusing me	I can look at it more closely after we go through these examples	1.0
	The second part of this particular example is using synthetic division	1.0
	Im asked to check this guy to see if thats a factor of this	1.0
	Im dividing this by that	1.0
	Iif I use synthetic division remember this is in the form X  K I copy down the coefficients to the fourth to the third to the second	1.0
	Theres no X to the first thats why theres a 0 there and then theres the 25	1.0
	I do my pattern of synthetic division to check that	1.0
	Now because my remainder is	8.0
Zero	Then thats a factor	1.0
Is that how it works	Joel asked me a question earlier with regards to what would be a fair test question	1.0
	If I have something that the cubic that youre asked to factor it will either be a pattern you recognize	1.0
	For example you could factor out one of the Xs and youve got a quadratic that you could factor or I might tell you that this is a factor of that polynomial	1.0
	Then I would ask you to go ahead and do synthetic division or long division either one to end up with something that then you could factor	1.0
	Well practice some of those	1.0
	Youre looking through either patterns that weve talked about today or I would give you a factor that you would divide by and what youd be left with is something you would factor	1.0
	Could be something thats in a quadratic type form could be a quadratic itself	1.0
	Looking at then this guy this is an example of that	1.0
	Show that thats a factor	1.0
	In other words this would be that type of prompt	1.0
	I have this guy Ive factored that one out and look at what Im left with	1.0
	Its the difference of two cubes so fair game	1.0
	We saw earlier we havent mastered it by any chance but we could refer back to it	1.0
	We recognize that and then we can go through and do the pattern that goes with it	1.0
	This is where youre given a factor you divide it out were left with something we recognize that we know a pattern for and then we can factor it	1.0
	Excellent type of test question for dividing polynomials and then heres an application problem	1.0
	Were going to stop here and go to the extra practice thats in the journal and were going to work on that	1.0
Its actually not straight at all	No yes	1.0
You  four different times in the window	Is that what it is	1.0
	Extra practice for	1.0
	Yes	1.0
I just	Did you know that youre	1.0
Yes	Youre right	1.0
	How are we going to rewrite those	8.0
Its and quantity and 3 and 3	What squared equals	8.0
	This is the difference of two squares thats where we have to learn to recognize	1.0
	Thats what happens when you factor the difference of two squares	1.0
	Then this is also the difference of two squares	1.0
	Theres no factoring the sum of	1.0
	All right seems like everybody got the toolkit so well press on	1.0
	Joanne whats step one	8.0
Isolate the radical on one side of the equation	Isolate the radical on one side of the equation	4.0
	For this particular example whats our first step going to be David	8.0
Isolate the radical	Isolate the radical	4.0
	Whats it going to take for us to get the radical by itself to divide by	8.0
Yes divide by two	Very good David	1.0
	Thats going to be our first step so dividing both sides by 2 we end up with 4 2 gives us 2	5.0
	Whats step two Tobias	8.0
Get rid of the plus one	Get rid of the plus one	2.0
	Jill	2.0
I can get rid of the radical	Get rid of the radical	4.0
	How do we know when we can get rid of the radical Tobias	8.0
When theres nothing outside of it and theres no other part of the equation thats like it	Yes basically nothing outside of the radical on that side of the equation so were good	5.0
	How are we going to go about doing that	8.0
	Tobias	2.0
Dont you square it	I could multiply it by itself	5.0
	Lets say if I did  x  and then Id have x1 over here	1.0
	Simplifying this Id end up with x1 but then I have this	1.0
Its not going to go over	Yes so have I simplified	2.0
No	Yes thats certainly a strategy were going to use at times so we want to remember that as an option	1.0
	In this case what do you think we should do Cordelia	8.0
Then we have to solve the resulting equation	Were not quite there yet	1.0
	Jason	2.0
You raise each side of the equation to the same exponent so then youd square both sides	That is what we want to do	1.0
	When we square both sides what happens to the radicals and the exponent	8.0
	They disappear we end up with 22 so that gives us x14	1.0
	Now we just need to simplify one step equation kind of thing	1.0
	Eliza what are we going to do to get x by itself now	8.0
You minus one	Minus one yes so we end up with x equals	8.0
Three	Three yes so weve got that as our answer then	5.0
	Whats the next step Nadia	8.0
Youre done	Were good	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Joel	2.0
You have to substitute the xy back into the	Right so were going to check our answer	1.0
	Were going to stick the three back into the equation basically asking the question does it hold true	2.0
	When I solve the left side is it going to equal four	2.0
	In this case yes indeed it does	1.0
	We want to do all three of those theyre all four of those steps as you Oh no lets do it again weve got another one	1.0
	Heres our equation were going to start with	1.0
	Jimmy what are we going to do first	8.0
	Were going to add one to both sides of the equation	1.0
	Now what was step one Joel	8.0
Isolate the radical	Isolate the radical	4.0
	When we add one to both sides will we have isolated the radical or are we done with that	2.0
Yes	Right so we add 1 to both sides so 21 gives us a 3 now weve got the radical by itself	1.0
	Carson what are we going to do next	8.0
	Whats step two	8.0
We cube each side	Yes cube each side	5.0
	Yes were going to cube each side	1.0
	Whatever we have here and whats 33 going to give us	8.0
Twentyseven	Twentyseven and what happens here	8.0
	The radical and the exponent it basically goes away and were left with a two step equation	1.0
	Zach whats the two steps that weve got to go through for this	8.0
	To get x by itself here whats my two steps	8.0
Cube each side	Weve done that were left with this two step equation	1.0
Add nine to each side then divide by two	Perfect now why did you say add nine as the first step instead of dividing by two first	9.0
Because otherwise you would still have the nine remaining	What would 9 2 give me	8.0
Four point five	Yes we probably dont want to deal with that	1.0
	Can you guys think what is the math reason that we use that says why we add nine first	8.0
Order of operations	Say that again	2.0
Order of operations	Order of operations	4.0
	What is order of operations	8.0
	Refresh our memory	1.0
Its reverse order of operations	It is its backwards	5.0
	We were solving for x this is the rationale and thats why we do that add and subtract first	1.0
	Yes you	1.0
If you add 9 to either side youd be left with 36 then if you divide by 2 you get left with 18 but if you divide it by 2 and 27 then you get	Thirteen and a half	1.0
	If I divide by two what do I have to do	8.0
	I have to divide everything by two so well still come up with the right answer	1.0
	Were just dealing then with decimals where we dont really have to	1.0
	Yes yes you just simplify	1.0
Its not so good	Yes its not too bad but in more complex problems we wouldnt want to be doing that so we end up with the two x36 2 as Zach said and we now have 18	1.0
	Then wed plug 18 back into the original equation and make sure that its going to equal 2	1.0
	We can take a look at that and so it checks out in this case	1.0
	Now what were going to do is these are your first practice problems	1.0
	Youve got three practice problems to work with you and your partner	1.0
	If you and your partner cant agree then go ahead and talk to more folks in your team	1.0
	First three problems on that extra piece of paper you got	1.0
Is that  equations	No	1.0
	Youll see some others that I have	1.0
	At any point if you and your partner want to check the answers they are on the monitor at my desk if you want to check for answers	1.0
	Thats why I gave you that to get started on	1.0
	Isolate the radical	1.0
Isolated the radical	Isolate the radical	1.0
	When you look at the original what is it that I want to isolate	8.0
	you want to isolate	8.0
	Yes so what do you have to do first	8.0
	You have to get rid of this	1.0
	Yes because otherwise the radical is not by itself	1.0
	Who needs more time on these three problems	2.0
	Ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	Eyes up on the front please	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Brittany we havent heard much from you so could you read the big paragraph	2.0
When you use  you should always check each apparent solution in the original equation	This is why the checking becomes really important	1.0
	Lets see who else have we not heard from	2.0
	Weve heard from Jane but you havent read	1.0
	Could you read that attend to precision	2.0
However you obtain x9 after squaring each side	In this particular example Brittany whats step one	8.0
Isolate the thing	Isolate the	4.0
	Weve isolated the radical so step two then	8.0
Get rid of the radical	Get rid of the radical so in this case we would raise it to	8.0
A second power	A second power and we would end up with x29	5.0
No x9	Im sorry yes x9	5.0
	If I plug nine back in here whats  9	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	Thats where were	1.0
	Thats showing us that you dont always get the right answer in these problems and so were going to go through some of those	1.0
Technicallycould you just not check it and understand that if its equal to a negative then its not going to have a solution	Well but if it was a cube root then a negative answer could have been appropriate but then there could still be one right answer and one wrong answer	1.0
	One way or another youve got to think about checking it whether you know to check it that wayas you were describing or you just do the math	1.0
	Were going to do this particular problem	1.0
	Brittany whats step number one	8.0
Isolate the radical	Isolate the radical so what do Ive to do to isolate the radical in this case	8.0
	Brittany	2.0
Yes	What do I have to do to isolate the radical here	8.0
Its already isolated	There you go	1.0
	Yes good	1.0
	Its already isolated	4.0
	Step two was	8.0
Get rid of the radical	Get rid of the radical	4.0
	What am I going to do to both sides	8.0
Square	Square both sides	4.0
Now were getting spicy	Why are we getting spicy	1.0
Foil	We do have to foil that	5.0
	We have to distribute the	8.0
I still dont know the foil is	Thats okay because foil is	8.0
Just one method of it	Yes	1.0
	Its a double distribution	1.0
	Whats going to happen here Brittany	8.0
Those cancel out	They cancel out	5.0
	What happened between here and here	8.0
You foiled it	Yes we foiled it first outer inner last	5.0
	You got to remember that this means  x	1.0
	Ive got the x2	1.0
	Ive got one x there and another x there for two over there	1.0
table method	Table method I think is a great way of organizing to multiply those	5.0
I agree	Whats step three of the process	8.0
Solve for x	Solve for x	4.0
	How do we solve for x in this case	8.0
	Joel what are we going to do	8.0
Im gonna subtract the 1	You got a different idea	3.0
	What are you thinking	8.0
You could subtract 7x and subtract 15 and just factor your brand new trinomial from there	I could do that and what would I end up with over here	8.0
Zero	Equals zero	5.0
Establishing zero	Yes and then we can use the zero product property if we can factor whats left over here	1.0
	What would be left over here is an x2 combining these	8.0
A negative I guess	Combining those	2.0
Minus 14	Are there factors of negative 14 that add up to 7	2.0
Yes	We can factor them	1.0
	Were going to use that strategy simply because we have quadratic linear and constants all in this	1.0
	Now if I didnt have these linear one	1.0
	Id put that one over there and then take the square root of both sides	1.0
	In this particular case since I have that linear term and the quadratic term I have to go through that process of factoring use the zero product property	1.0
	My x values are	8.0
Negative two and seven	Negative two and seven	4.0
	Youve got those	1.0
	Whats the last step Brittany	8.0
You solve for x	We did solve for x	5.0
Oh I knew that	We got that	1.0
	What comes right after that	8.0
We plug it back in and check and make sure	Yes were going to check our answer	5.0
	We have two answers to plug back in so you want to be careful about how you do go through that process	1.0
	Lo and behold one of them doesnt come out true	1.0
	This is that example of an extraneous solution	1.0
an example of a headache	Yes its a headache	5.0
	We did all of our math correct but because we started doing things like squaring both sides it morphed into something that is not going to really solve the original equation	1.0
	Yes	1.0
If I remember it correctly but Im not sure  of the solutions could be correct	Not that Ive seen so far but I think the answer would be yes	1.0
	In your toolkit go ahead and have that toolkit open in front of you we have this little note right here now about extraneous solutions	1.0
	Step four lets write a note	1.0
	You dont necessarily have to write everything you see here but you do need to write something that explains this whole idea of extraneous solutions	1.0
	I will  the song	1.0
	The next example were going to go through is where we actually have two radicals	1.0
	How are we going to work with more than one radical	8.0
	We have this equation that were starting with	1.0
	What do you guys think that were going to do	8.0
	Talk with your partner	2.0
	What do you think our first step is for solving this kind of problem	8.0
	Even though we have two radicals and we have something thats outside of a radical were squaring both sides	1.0
	Notice that we arent selective about what were squaring	1.0
	Its everything on the left and everything on the right gets squared	1.0
	What does it look like once we finish that	8.0
	Thankfully this side looks a whole lot less complex	1.0
Its really easy to do it	Then I have to do that whole distribution	1.0
	When I multiply this lets look at it	1.0
	Weve got  x	1.0
	When we look at that and I multiply these two things together Im just left with the x2	1.0
	Theres that	1.0
	When I multiply those two together and I multiply those two together I get two of those guys	1.0
	Thats where we see that we have 2 of the x2 under the	1.0
	Then my last one to do is multiply 1x1	1.0
	We have that plus one there	1.0
	You havent seen problems like this before	1.0
	We just have to think through that process	1.0
	Now what do you think were going to need to do	8.0
Just simplify	Were going to do that simplifying thing	5.0
	Where do we have some like terms	8.0
	Theres a plus two and a three over here	1.0
Also the x	There is an x and an x over here	5.0
You would just subtract in both sides	We got this guy here too with the numbers	1.0
	What do you think our strategy is here	8.0
	Where are we going to put everything Tobias	8.0
I would first of all just subtract all the constants so I would subtract two and one in both sides	What happens then if I subtract two and one	8.0
	What happens over here	8.0
Youre getting rid of the entire three because that equals three so you can	Yes so thatll go away	5.0
	We are simplifying its getting more simple as we go	1.0
Then you subtract x from both sides which will get you negative two x	Ive got a negative two x	5.0
	Then	8.0
Then you divide both sides by two	Divide by two that gets rid of that	5.0
That gets you back to negative x and then you just square both sides and then it just gives you x2x2	In other words what Tobias was saying is were going to isolate the radical	1.0
	Were basically going back to step one isolate the radical whats it going to take to do that	8.0
	We want to get this guy by itself	1.0
	Thats all were going to do	1.0
	A lot of steps to that	1.0
	You got to keep track	1.0
	You got to be careful when you draw your radical symbols that youre not making it look like the plus one is included or the plus two is not included	1.0
	You got to be really careful when you write them	1.0
	As we walk through that process we eventually get to the point that we have isolated the radical	1.0
	Brittany after we isolate the radical what do we do	8.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	We square both sides and were left with x2x2	1.0
	Oh my goodness	1.0
	Were back at this simplifying step	1.0
	Weve got a quadratic we got a linear term weve got a constant	1.0
	What are we going to do	8.0
Factor	Yes were going to see if we can factor so that means everythings going to go on one side	5.0
	Do I want to subtract all of this or subtract that	8.0
Subtract the x in the negative two	Why would I prefer to move these over here instead of moving that over here	9.0
To keep the leading coefficient positive	Yes so we can have a positive one with the x2	1.0
	That is the next step	1.0
	Are there factors of negative two that add up to negative one	2.0
Yes	They would be	8.0
Negative two or positive one	We can factor	1.0
	We can come up with our answers using the zero product property	1.0
	Then its time to check	1.0
	Lo and behold one of them works one of them doesnt work	1.0
	Weve got this extraneous solution thing going on here	1.0
	We cant use the x value of two	1.0
	We just have one answer	1.0
	Were going to practice	1.0
	Before I do that	1.0
	In these cases if we have calculators which were not going to have the calculators on the test	1.0
Its not complex stuff	Its right	1.0
	That last one when we solved it even though there were a lot of steps to it there wasnt anything we couldnt do	1.0
going to make us graph that by hand	No I dont think so	1.0
	My guess is more it would be like a level two multiple choice	1.0
	Match the equation with the graph or match the graph with the equation kind of thing	1.0
	Describe the translations from the parent function kind of thing	1.0
Are we going to have graphs on the level threes	You mean have to graph things	1.0
	I dont know at this point	1.0
	Actually I havent seen the test	1.0
	Im not making the test this time	1.0
Is the extraneous answer always going to be when x is negative	I dont know well look for patterns and see	1.0
In looking for patterns it looks like whenever x is negative	Yes with our sample set	1.0
	Pretty small	1.0
	In these types of equations if you graph one side of the equal sign and then graph the other so theyve put them in y one and y two we can use the second calc intersect option on the calculator to come up with our answer	1.0
	Notice how it only came up with x1	1.0
	What did we come up with over here	8.0
	Whats the one answer that works	8.0
x2	Where we plugged in the negative one	1.0
	Thats the one that worked	1.0
could have just waited for the question to be answered	Yes	1.0
	Thats okay	1.0
I have a question	Yes	1.0
Whos making the test	Mrhow do you say his name	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Heres some practice problems that have two radicals in them	1.0
	Brittany whats going to be our first step	8.0
Isolate the radical	We cant if theres two of them	1.0
Square	Yes were going to square both sides	5.0
when one is a cube root and one is a square root	Well yes youd probably raised it to the sixth power	1.0
	You dont want to do that when	1.0
Can we write these on the paper	Yes	1.0
	This is what youre writing on your paper	1.0
	These are problems five six and seven	1.0
	Ill have the answers on my screen when youre ready to check	1.0
	Which one do you want to move	8.0
	How do I factor that	8.0
	Joel explain to her how to factor that	8.0
	You got all of those	2.0
Yes	Have you checked your answers yet	2.0
Im good at math	Whats our first step	8.0
	Think about it this way if I have negative two x minus two x what would I have	8.0
Negative four	Yes so I have negative four times the square root	5.0
	Then Im dividing by negative four which is quite right	1.0
	We got to everything	1.0
	Is that what you got	2.0
	Now its like Im starting all over again	1.0
	Ive got all this and now were back to step one	1.0
	I isolated that I square those signs	1.0
	Whos done with the three problems	1.0
	We got a good group of people done	1.0
	Lets just take another minute or so	1.0
	Here is number seven for you to refer to	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Who needs help	2.0
	Anybody need help	2.0
	Joel did you all do the problem	2.0
Okay guys okay	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	Were going to move on to a new example	1.0
	Vijay lets come back to your seat	1.0
I was helping Joel	Joel you too	1.0
	Brittany be very careful about how you word the first step for this problem	1.0
	What are we going to do	8.0
	Whats the goal	8.0
	Whats step one for this type of problem because we just switched problems	8.0
What I would do is to make that into a radical and then write	Or we could treat is as the fourth root to x cubed	1.0
Isolate it	Im looking for something along those lines	1.0
	Joel	2.0
Isolate the exponent	Isolate the exponent	4.0
	Were not dealing with radicals right now	1.0
	Were dealing with rational exponents	1.0
	Whatever has this rational exponent remember rational just means its a fraction	1.0
	Weve got to isolate that	1.0
	Matt whats our first step	8.0
The first step is to minus two	Yes so well subtract two from both sides	5.0
	On the left side we get an	8.0
Eight	eight	4.0
	Now what do we do Cordelia	8.0
You have to like do the flippy thingy	The flippy thingy	4.0
Where are you making it into the radical	What are we going to flip	8.0
The three fourth thing	The three fourth	4.0
	What do we call that when we flip it	8.0
Reciprocal	Reciprocal	4.0
Yes reciprocal	We have four thirds and we got to do that as well	1.0
	Because three fourth times fourthirds equals	8.0
One	Now we have to take eight and raise it to the fourthirds power	1.0
	Lets imagine this is a test question and you dont have a calculator	1.0
	How do you want to think about eight to the fourthirds power	8.0
You find the cube root of eight and thats two and then you multiply that by the other exponent	Heres where weve got to make sure we understand which one of those numbers goes where	1.0
	If you remember that if we said the square root of four is the same thing as four to the one half that helps us remember that the index is the denominator	1.0
	I dont know if we could think index has a D in it and its a denominator	1.0
	Figure out some way of remembering that	1.0
	Obviously it was easier to find the cube root of eight first than it would have been to do the other way around	1.0
	We could have said we wanted to find eight to the fourth and then take the cube root of that but I really dont want to multiply eight times eight times eight times eight	1.0
	There is a route thats going to simplify that	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Last step here Jared	8.0
Divide both sides by two	Divide by two	4.0
	X is going to equal	8.0
Eight	Yes we check our answer	1.0
	Plug eight in	5.0
	Turns out it works	1.0
	We have our solution	1.0
I have a question	Yes	1.0
Its basically when youre doing the raise each sides of four thirds youre putting the power of the reciprocal of both sides	Right because whatever we do to one side we got to do to the other and we do it to everything	1.0
	Another example	1.0
	Whats our first step Brittany	8.0
Well it already is isolated	It is isolated	5.0
	What is isolated	8.0
The rational exponent so like that	Nice good good	1.0
	What are we going to raise both sides to	8.0
Two over one	Two over one	4.0
	Two over one just is	8.0
Squared	Were just going to square both sides	5.0
Do you have to use brackets or can you use more parentheses	Typically you see if theres parentheses that use brackets but more parentheses is fine	5.0
would use the bigger parentheses	Yes thats fine	1.0
	We end up with x plus 30 equals x squared	1.0
	Joel what are you going to do if I got a quadratic a constant and a linear term	8.0
Subtract the x over	Subtract the x over okay	5.0
Then you get 30 equals x	Then what do I do	8.0
No because thats x squared	What do you think	3.0
	Go ahead	2.0
You have to subtract the 30 Im assuming	Weve got the 30	5.0
	If we subtract that then this whole thing is going to equal	8.0
Zero	Are there factors of negative 30 that add up to negative 1	8.0
Five and six	Five and six	4.0
	Which one has to be negative	8.0
Negative six	Six will have to be the negative one	5.0
	We come down to where we can factor	1.0
	Joel when we have quadratic constant and linear terms what do we want to do	8.0
Factor it	Were going to go towards factoring but in between what do we want to do	8.0
Set it equal to zero	Set it equal to zero	4.0
	Yes	1.0
	When we see we have those three different types of terms we want to set it equal to zero we factor so my two possible solutions here are going to be	8.0
Positive six and negative five	There we go	1.0
	Weve got those	1.0
	Lo and behold once we check one of them doesnt work	1.0
	Lets remember how important that checking process is so that we have the right answer	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets practice eight nine and 10 on your paper	1.0
	Yes	1.0
Can we take a break	Thats on the safe side	1.0
	Whats negative 12 times 3 going to be	8.0
	Negative 36	1.0
	Is there some number times itself three times Remember when we wrote those out here the other day	2.0
	Whats two to the third equal	8.0
Two times two times two	Two times two times two equals	8.0
Eight	Is eight a factor of 36	2.0
	Whats three times three times three	8.0
	Thats actually 27	1.0
	Will negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3 be negative 27	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Thank you Caroline	1.0
	Now I plug in Whats three times negative nine	8.0
	The cube root of negative 27 is	8.0
	Bingo okay	1.0
	Youll plug this in then add it and then take the square root of it	1.0
	Nine the square root of nine is three and then	1.0
	Who is not done	2.0
	Who is not done and needs a little more time	2.0
	Ladies and gentlemen our last example	1.0
	Last example here	1.0
	Were now looking at inequality so what we do if we have radicals or rational exponents and were solving an inequality	1.0
	In other words we have an inequality symbol thats the only thing we see thats different	1.0
	We could have any kind of algebraic expression underneath the radical so the radicand could be x squared plus four x minus six	1.0
	Remember we could have any root we want	1.0
	Its going to be pretty similar once weve isolated the radical well raise it to the power	1.0
	Theres one thing that we have to consider is values of the radicand that makes sense	1.0
	For example can we take the square root of a negative number	2.0
No	No	4.0
	In other words weve got to make sure that if were taking a square root that were considering the fact that the radicand has to be positive	1.0
	For example if we ended up having something like x minus two that were working with this x minus two would have to be greater than zero	1.0
	Now if I add two to both sides x has to be greater than zero	1.0
	Is it okay to have zero in the radical	2.0
	Can it equal zero	2.0
	Is that okay	2.0
Yes	Yes because when you take the square root to zero right	2.0
	Im going to add a little equal bar	1.0
	In this particular case not only do we have to solve the problem but I also have to think about Oh if this has to be a positive value then thats going to put a limitation on my input values my x values my independent variables	1.0
	Now were going to solve this guy weve got a less than or equal to symbol	1.0
	Brittany what do we have to do	8.0
Divide by three	Weve got to divide by three so we do that first	5.0
Equals four	Weve got that now and then what are we going to do to both sides	8.0
Get rid of the radical	Get rid of the radical so such as a square root were going to square both sides	5.0
	Four squared is	8.0
	Weve got the x minus 1 is less than or equal to 16	5.0
	We then	8.0
Add one	Add one and so were left with this expression that x can be any values that are less than or equal to 17	5.0
I think  does the inequality symbol ever switch because  divided by negative number you have to switch it	Right so what would have caused it to switch	8.0
	How could I change my original	8.0
Multiply with negative	Yes because when I divide by a negative I would have had to change that	5.0
	When I multiply or divide by a negative number thats when its switched so yes that could happen	1.0
	Now I not only have this but now I got to look x minus one because its a square root has to be a positive number so greater than or equal to zero	1.0
	X has to be greater than or equal to	1.0
	Now I got to combine these two and check does it make sense	2.0
	Can I have x values that are less than or equal to 17 and greater than or equal to 1 and how would I write my final answer to show that both of those are true	8.0
	X is in between what two numbers	8.0
1 and 17	Im always going to use a less than symbol and then I have to ask do I need to add the equal sign to it	2.0
	Im going to express my final answer with those considerations	1.0
	Lets show you the rest of that and then this is checking it on the calculator	1.0
	Thats our last example solving like we normally solve plus considering if this guy has  on it if its an even root well have to evaluate that	1.0
	Heres our last two practice problems	1.0
	Sure is it already queued up or	1.0
No	No okay	1.0
Do exponents switch to inequality	Tobias you better be nice to me	1.0
Its just amazing	Thats it for the examples and then that does mean that Heres the practice problems to go with  plan	1.0
	I would recommend that you check the website	1.0
	Seven six five four three two one zero	1.0
	We are going to move one to surface area	1.0
	Surface area is very similar to the area of composite figures because what we are going to be finding the area of is made up of multiple parts	1.0
	When do we find surface area	8.0
	We find surface area of threedimensional objects	1.0
	What is a threedimensional object	8.0
	Toby	2.0
	Three dimensional is not flat	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Two dimensional is a flat shape three dimensional is a not flat shape	1.0
	So this is a threedimensional shape	1.0
	Whats happening	8.0
	If Im finding this surface area what do you think Im finding on this shape	8.0
	Talk to your group what am I finding	8.0
	Three two one	1.0
	What do you guys think Im trying to find if Im finding this surface area	1.0
	Guy	2.0
	Its the area around like the outside of it	7.0
	The area of each of the surfaces surface area	5.0
	So on this Kleenex box I will be finding the area of the bottom and the top the front and the back and the two sides	1.0
	On this shape here itd be the same thing	1.0
	Were working on threedimensional shapes	1.0
	Now when we do this this needs to First of all understand if your shape is a prism or a pyramid	1.0
	On your desks Ive passed out a little sheet of paper and on this little sheet of paper and its really small it says that in solid  threedimensional figure that encloses its face	1.0
	A polyhedron is a solid whose faces are all polygons so a polygon is a closed shape with three or more sides	1.0
	What is the face of a shape	8.0
	What is a face	8.0
	It could be the front not necessarily just the front though right	2.0
	Its surface	7.0
	Its surface	5.0
	A face is the flat surface of a polyhedron	7.0
	The flat surface so its not just necessarily the front	5.0
	Im looking at this right now this is a face but so is this and so is this and so is this and so is this and so is this	1.0
	There are multiple faces on there	1.0
	Also these are faces	1.0
	Any flat surface on it is a face and I can open it up and this is called a net	1.0
	Theres this shape this is a net	1.0
	When I fold it up its three dimensional when I unfold it it becomes two dimensional and its a net so you can see all of these surfaces	1.0
	You guys are supposed to be able to find the surface area of a net and if it is three dimensional but those are kind of the same thing	1.0
	Dexter	2.0
	No	1.0
	What is an edge of a threedimensional shape	8.0
	You guys learned this like in third grade second grade	1.0
	An edge Walker	8.0
	Where two lines intersect	7.0
	Its where two faces intersect	5.0
	So the edge like this is the edge edge so where there are two flat surfaces come together that is your edge	1.0
	On a Kleenex box this side and this side meet right there to create this edge	1.0
	This meets with the top to create this edge	1.0
	What is a vertex	8.0
	What is the vertex Cody	8.0
	Where three or more edges meet	7.0
	Where three or more edges meet	4.0
	You could also call it the what	8.0
	Corner	1.0
	Your vertex	1.0
	If I look at this this edge this edge and this edge all meet to create that corner	1.0
	So we have the vertex	1.0
	Now the really important piece is whats next	1.0
	Its on the bottom of this	1.0
	There are two different types of threedimensional figures	1.0
	There are prisms and there are pyramids and there is a difference	1.0
	You guys are going to have to be able to identify whether youre finding a pyramid or a prism	1.0
	Who wants to read the definition of a prism	2.0
	Prism Tom	2.0
	Polyhedron	2.0
	A prism has two faces	1.0
	I would get a highlighter out there and highlight prism and highlight that has two parallel identical bases	1.0
	It is not dependent upon the shape of the base it depends on how many bases it has	1.0
	Okay read for me the definition of a pyramid	2.0
	Grace	2.0
	Polyhedron	1.0
	A pyramid has one base and all of the faces of a pyramid are triangles and they create a point an apex at the top	1.0
	Here I have two shapes two three dimensional shapes in my hand	1.0
	They both have a base that is a hexagon which ones a pyramid and which one is a prism	8.0
	Matteo	2.0
	This one is the pyramid and this one is the	8.0
	The prism	7.0
	The prism	4.0
	The prism has the base which my hand is on plus do you see the base	2.0
	Yes	7.0
	Yes	4.0
	It is a prism	1.0
	Look at the faces of it theyre all rectangles and they all connect to the two faces	1.0
	This guy is a pyramid its on its one base right here	1.0
	If I go like this can I put it in my hand	2.0
	No	7.0
	No	4.0
	It only has one base	1.0
	This is the apex this is the top	1.0
	Look at all the faces of this one what are the faces	8.0
	Triangles	7.0
	Theyre all triangles so that is the difference	5.0
	If I pulled up this one the base is a pentagon the base of this is a pentagon but do you see the difference	2.0
	Prism pyramid	1.0
	Prism pyramid	1.0
	Prism pyramid right	2.0
	Ancient Egyptians	2.0
	So we think about the Egyptians and the ancient pyramids that they created	1.0
	A prism has two bases a pyramid only has one	1.0
	Im trying to see so this one what is this one	8.0
	This looks like ancient Egyptians	1.0
	This one is a	8.0
	Prism	7.0
	Prism which is a square because this one has the base is like this	5.0
	Pyramid prism	1.0
	Tucker yes	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Look at it and this one could be tricky because some kids might say Oh well this one this looks like a prism because that looks like just the one base	1.0
	No this looks like a tent	1.0
	Sometimes you have to think about the sides of it	1.0
	Your bases are actually here and here your bases are parallel to each other	1.0
	Theyre like a little longer and the side and the base are not parallel like theyre a little	7.0
	Longer	2.0
	Yes your lateral faces like on this one theyre not parallel because theyre touching at the top at the apex	5.0
	All right so were going to find the surface area first of these threedimensional shapes and then in a couple of days were going to work on finding the volume	1.0
	So exciting	1.0
	Everybody gets some of these	1.0
	Yes you may	1.0
	In your toolkit you guys have the success criteria for surface area and volume you glued it in on the page like something I dont know 20ish 18	1.0
	You can glue this in with it	1.0
	Is it glued in	1.0
	Did I not give it to you	1.0
	I will give it to you now so you can glue this in and their surface area	1.0
	Or you can put surface area and volume	1.0
	You can use the  criteria	1.0
	Surface area and volume they both really look weird theyre on the same sheet and you can write surface area and volume on there	1.0
	All right so each one of you youre going to	1.0
	Let me just start the  criteria	1.0
	These are the steps youre going to follow this will help you be successful when finding the surface area and the volume of prisms and the number one if youre ever going to identify the shape	1.0
	When youre identifying I want you to think about is that the pyramid or prism and were determining that youre covering surface area which is covering it or if youre finding the volume or filling it	1.0
	Right now were just going to be doing surface area in a couple of days were going to move to that	1.0
	You need to then identify the dimensions you need write the correct formula or equation substitute your dimensions in and then solve it algebraically	1.0
	Then the final thing is to label your answer with the correct names	1.0
	It is time now	1.0
	This is a rectangular prism	1.0
	Why we cant have nice things like this	1.0
	thinking maybe what we could do is pass out the review ahead of time so that you can just bring your review to the carpet	1.0
	When youre with me youll bring your  to Ms Travers	1.0
	Agree	1.0
	Then when youre doing this do you want them to solve number 10	1.0
	I think so	1.0
	This is number 10 in your math packet	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	By yourself right	1.0
	Or with a partner	1.0
	I think its okay of they sit with each other and talk through it together	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You have to be with a partner within your group	1.0
	Your group	1.0
	Then once you and that partner have gone through and talked through number 10 then they can grab the fraction match cards and	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	SoTis bringing you your review	1.0
	When you have it if youre in Group A you are going to come to the carpet with the clipboard	1.0
	If you are in Group B youre going to come to the back table with the clipboard and pencil	1.0
	If youre in Group C you will work on Number 10	1.0
Ms Herd	Yes	2.0
Turn the page please	So youve already done some of this	2.0
Yes	Excellent	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then you can be the expert	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ms Jackson is it okay if I move this to the back	1.0
	Oh yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Can you push that down for me honey	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Matthew Owen can you move those chairs for me so I can push the back	1.0
Why are they over there	I asked them to	1.0
	What group are you in	1.0
	You just be responsible for you	1.0
	the carpet	1.0
Seat	Desks	1.0
	Excuse me friends	1.0
	Thank you Claire	1.0
	Thank you Claire	1.0
I would normLily want to be partnered	Theyre just listening to the words were talking about in math	1.0
I dont think  maybe its recording	It is	1.0
	It just listens to the words that we talk about in math	1.0
	Go up to Ms Jackson please	1.0
	It might be at your desk	1.0
I dont think Nolan he doesnt want to do it	So friends what number are we starting with	2.0
We had to	Thats fine	1.0
	Fern why dont you just grab that chair	1.0
	Maybe you could just come sit right here	1.0
	Is this an extra	1.0
Yes	Ill put this in the middle	1.0
	Sit over here	1.0
	Lily is she gone	1.0
	Oh okay	1.0
	Lily is it okay if I put this on your desk	1.0
	Lily is it okay if I set this on your desk	1.0
Okay	All right	1.0
	So friends we are starting on Number 11 and our goal on number 11 is to were going to go ahead and just read through some of these together and start solving	1.0
	Are you on Number 11	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were all starting on Number 11 together	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So friends Number 11	1.0
	Hannah will you read it for us	2.0
The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	Okay	1.0
	What is this one asking us to do	8.0
	What is Number 11 asking us for	8.0
Its asking us to draw pictures of turns using an arc to the direction of each one	Okay	1.0
	So what do we have	8.0
The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you	Okay	1.0
	So on Number 11A we have something like this right	2.0
	We need a halfturn clockwise	1.0
	What does that look like	8.0
Excuse me	So half a turn	1.0
So were facing right here and then I think we have to figure out	Stand up	1.0
to do a half turn	Right	1.0
	So if were standing and were facing the front right	2.0
That way youre facing this way the arrow	Like the arrow this way	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	What would a halfturn look like	8.0
	Are we going clockwise or counterclockwise	8.0
Clockwise	Clockwise	4.0
	So we would go half turn	1.0
We would just draw an arrow this way	Okay	1.0
	So it would look like	1.0
I get that	So it was like this and a half turn would mean now its	8.0
Like that	like that because it went all the way a halfway turn the same way the hands go on a clock	5.0
	So what would it look like on B	8.0
	Onefourth of a turn counterclockwise	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So 11B starts like this	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Onefourth of a turn	1.0
	Daniel well tell us what youre thinking	8.0
Im thinking we show a clock mostly turns right so we should do it left in like a quarter of a half turn	So what do you mean by a quarter of a halfturn	8.0
If you do a full half turn and just erase half of that	Im hearing you say half of half is one quarter	2.0
Yes	Or onefourth times two is one half	2.0
Yes	So that would look like one quarter turn counterclockwise would be what	8.0
Like that	So now it would be facing this way	2.0
Yes	If this turned a quarter turn counterclockwise this arrow would now be this way	1.0
	Is that what youre saying	2.0
	A quarter of a turn	1.0
	You guys agree disagree	3.0
I agree I think	So Luke I want to see in yours I want you to draw in on this one on 11A and 11B	1.0
	You need to draw in what the new arrow would look like	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	On 11A it makes a halfturn clockwise and on 11B its one quarter turn counterclockwise	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Noah what do you need honey	2.0
Im thinking	Okay	1.0
	You did Number 10	1.0
	Sam what are you working on honey	2.0
Im doing the same	So the directions are you finish Number 10 and then you play what	2.0
	There you go	1.0
What about one through nine	Were going to switch in a few minutes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	12	1.0
	Lets keep going friends	1.0
Like that	Yes	1.0
Okay	Why Zoe	9.0
Because we are turning that way	A quarterturn counterclockwise	5.0
	Number 12 is estimate the size of the angle	1.0
	What are our choices	8.0
Ninety to a hundred 180  180	Okay	1.0
	Youre sitting at some groups of four	1.0
	I want you to talk about what estimate What do you think the answer is and why	1.0
	You need to look at where the arch is on the angle	1.0
Nolans right with the 90 between 180	Are you measuring where 90 degrees would be	2.0
	Smart thinking	1.0
	Tell me why youre doing that	9.0
I think we should maybe circle 90 to 180 degrees so that we know its that one	If its obtuse what are you circling	8.0
	Good	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You guys got 90 to 180	2.0
	What did you guys get	8.0
We got 90 to 180	Excellent	1.0
	Move on to the next	1.0
	Angle ABC what would you name that	8.0
	Acute obtuse or right	8.0
Obtuse	Obtuse	4.0
	Good	1.0
	Lets do the next one	1.0
I think its a zero between 90	Talk to your team and tell your friends why	9.0
I think its zero through 90	Why	9.0
Zero to 90	How do you know	9.0
The angle is smaller than 90 degrees	How do you know	9.0
If it were a right angle or 90 degrees it would be like that and its	The line  would meet at a perfect  degrees	5.0
Pointing like that	Youre good	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	So  you guys say acute	2.0
Yes	Acute	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	My friends Im excited to do Number 13	1.0
	This is one of the lessons we did when I was here	1.0
	What does the word symmetry or symmetric mean	8.0
	If a figure has symmetry	8.0
	Would you please tell your teammates talk about what is symmetry	8.0
Symmetry its where its the same on both sides	The same what on both sides	8.0
If its the same  shape	Say that word again	2.0
	The image would be reflective on a line of	8.0
So we got to go this we go to go this we got to go this	No	1.0
	Only one line	1.0
Draw all the lines of symmetry	When it says draw all the lines of symmetry what I want to talk about on Number 13A is how many lines of symmetry will we be drawing	8.0
Four	Lets think about that and then well share	1.0
	Could you have a reflection any other way on that	2.0
	Thank you Luke and Lily	1.0
	Can I hold this up for a second	1.0
I came up with all those answers	Friends what do you Does this show symmetry	2.0
	Right here	1.0
	If we drew a line right here could we fold it and both sides would match up perfectly it would be a reflection	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Do you see where you need to add	2.0
	Now this is not symmetry	1.0
	It has to be perfect	1.0
	The lines when you match up if it folded it would have to line up perfectly	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Ms Jackson can we switch in like two minutes	1.0
	I know and I think they may just have to continue on	1.0
	I think its really good to have these smaller group conversations	1.0
	All right	1.0
	On Number 14 what is a strategy to draw the other half	8.0
We could measure it	How did you know what to do	9.0
We could fold it in half and	Fern will you tell us how did you know what to do	9.0
Because I know its a square you could  a diamond and a Its half	Okay	1.0
	On number 14 how do you know what to draw where	9.0
You kind of copy it	When you say look at it look at what	8.0
Or you could fold it the reflection	What youre thinking about is if it was flipped over the line if that figure was flipped over the line of symmetry what would it look like on the other side	2.0
Yes	Look at that strategy Ferns doing folding the paper	1.0
	Remember when we did that	2.0
	Thats another way to check	1.0
She just did that on a math test	Friends Number 15 is similar to what we did yesterday	1.0
	Remember yesterday we had this chart and were solving multistep multiplication number stories	1.0
	This is a clue to you what kind of problem are you going to have on Number 15	1.0
Were going to talk about it	Were going to talk about it for just a minute	1.0
	What kind of problem will we have	8.0
	A multistep	2.0
	Remember we need	8.0
Story	A single	8.0
Number	Youre going to have to write it out as a number model and you will need parenthesis	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So lets read through it	1.0
	You guys can just work on 15 and talk through it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
If each football costs 8 and each science kit costs 11 how much money will the boys have left over after theyve purchased the items	Remember our chart up here	2.0
	What is the problem asking and what are the steps	8.0
Or we could do three times and then we could do like	What are you guys thinking that Number 15 is asking us to find	8.0
Find	Part of it is	1.0
Find how much money the boys will have left over	Were going to find how much the total would be and then how much money is left after they buy those items	2.0
Yes	Whats our strategy for setting up this problem	8.0
I think I know	Everybody think for a minute	1.0
	What is it	8.0
	Everybody write down how to set it up and then well see if we have similar thinking	1.0
	Tell me why you have three times eight	1.0
Because three times eight is the football and then three times 11 is the science kit and then minus	So the first thing you have to do is find that total	1.0
Dash was asking us	I would find that total first	1.0
	You want to find out how much money is it going to cost them to buy those items	1.0
6500	Yes but Correct	1.0
	You could but is this addition or multiplication	8.0
Multiplication	Are you sure about that	2.0
Of course	Well lets think about it	1.0
	What would you need	8.0
	Why would we need addition not multiplication	9.0
Because multiplication if we add this total and this total then you would multiply those  because that would be not the correct answer	Were looking for adding the two amounts together	1.0
	How much do the footballs cost	8.0
	How much do the Whats the other thing	8.0
Science kits	Science kits	4.0
	We put those two totals together	1.0
Then we can do equals	What do we know so far	8.0
	How much do the footballs cost	8.0
800	And how many boys are there	8.0
Three	We have to do eight boys times 3 right	2.0
	Start with what we know	1.0
	Then we have	8.0
11	I love how you have three times eight and 11 times three	1.0
	What do we need to do with these two amounts	8.0
What would that unknown letter be	D for dollars maybe	2.0
	Is this a plus or a times	8.0
	Were going to be adding the two of them	1.0
Whats three times eight	Youre going to figure out both of these and then add those both together	1.0
I have no  and I have no	Ladies and gentlemen high five	1.0
	Thank you so much for getting quiet so quickly	1.0
	We are going to do a switch	1.0
What are you doing	My friends  right here because we didnt get through to Number 9  the math game once we finish Number 10	1.0
	Great idea	1.0
	Then I want you and your partner to go back and finish the ones we didnt finish the one through nine	1.0
	The math game is only when youre done with your problems	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	My friends on the carpet I want you to be with your same partner	1.0
	Youre going to do Number 10 with your partner and then youre going to go back and do finish one through eight	1.0
	Great	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Freeze please	1.0
	If you work at the carpet you are going to come to me at the back table now	1.0
	If you were at the back table you are going to go to the desks now	1.0
Do we work with partners	You may or by yourself	1.0
	If you are the desks you are going to head to the carpet	1.0
The answer is 45	Ms Jackson can you play your bell	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Move to your next rotation please	1.0
	Its okay if youre not quite done but were going to move on to the next part	1.0
	You can be our expert	1.0
	Talk to us about your thinking	1.0
	Id like you to please turn to Number 11	1.0
Why is this split	It just helps us all fit in	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Is this an extra one	1.0
	All right guys	1.0
	Lets look at Number 11	1.0
	On Number 11 Mason do you need to find someone to work with honey	1.0
	You can sit with Luke	1.0
	You can sit over here sit over here	1.0
	Its up to you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Number 11	1.0
	Can everybody put their finger on Number 11 so I know youre with me	2.0
	Number 11	1.0
Number 11	Were going to be drawing pictures to show the rotations	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Remember our lesson where we stood up and we turned our bodies for different rotations clockwise and counterclockwise	2.0
	Thats what were doing here but instead of our bodies were looking at the line segments or in this case this would be a line because it goes on and on	1.0
	What were doing is were Can everybody see where I am right now from where youre sitting	1.0
	If we are looking at this line right here and were turning it a half	1.0
A half turn	Half turn clockwise	5.0
	Were turning to the right	1.0
Oh your right	Were turning it	1.0
	This arrow would move a halfturn clockwise and now our line segment would be looking like this	1.0
	Get your pencil ready	1.0
	Youre going to touch the end of the arrow and youre going to do a halfturn clockwise	1.0
	After a halfturn clockwise then we draw in the line segment	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now what is B asking us to do	8.0
One fourth turn counterclockwise	Onefourth of a turn	5.0
	Instead of clockwise were going to	8.0
Left	To the left the opposite direction	5.0
	Take your pencil and touch the top of the arrow and were going to turn counterclockwise	1.0
	How do we know how far to go	8.0
We did one whole right there so about 180 degrees	One hundred eighty is a half	5.0
Its going to be 270	Thats three fourths	1.0
	My friends think about quarters think about dollars	1.0
	If you have 1 how many quarters is one quarter	8.0
Four	Well how many quarters are in a dollar	8.0
Four	Four	4.0
	One quarter means one out of four	1.0
	Were going onefourth of a turn or a quarter of a turn counterclockwise	1.0
	Heres my arrow	1.0
	Heres my arrow and Im going to go counterclockwise a quarter of a turn	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You got it	1.0
	counterclockwise a quarter of a turn	1.0
	counterclockwise a quarter of a turn	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets keep going	1.0
	Michael can you read Number 12 for us	2.0
Circle the best answer	Okay	1.0
	I want everyone to think to themselves and were going to do thumbs up if I read what you think it is	1.0
	Look at the angle ABC right here	1.0
	Can you please thumbs up if you think angle ABC is between zero and 90 degrees	2.0
	Thumbs up if you think its between 90 and 180	2.0
	Thumbs up if you think its 180 to 270	2.0
	Anyone willing to share their thinking how they know	9.0
I think its zero through 90 number one because C right there it would probably be 90	What does a 90degree angle look like	8.0
It looks like that	Exactly	1.0
	If a 90degree angle is a perfect	8.0
	A perfect	8.0
This ones like this	Does this angle look like its Look where the arc is	1.0
	I think 90 degrees would be like this	1.0
	Liza	2.0
Yes if this was 90 itd be right here or	Can I have everyone look right up here on my paper	2.0
	This is what a 90degree angle looks like	1.0
	Look at the arc	1.0
	Is our arc	1.0
I cant see	Right here	2.0
No	Is it a little bigger than 90 degrees	2.0
Yes	But this is 180 is it all the way at 180	2.0
No	No	4.0
	So we know its not 180 to 270	1.0
	Its too big	1.0
	Thats too big	1.0
	Aiden can I have your eyes please	1.0
	We know that if this is 90 we know its greater than 90 degrees	1.0
	Since this ray right here is in between 90 and 180 we would call This angle is between 90 and 180 degrees	1.0
	Its bigger than 90 but its less than 180	1.0
	What do we call an angle that is bigger than 90 degrees but less than 180	8.0
	Think through that	1.0
	Look at the three choices we have	1.0
	Acute obtuse or right	1.0
	If an angles bigger than Its greater than 90 but less than 180	1.0
	What do you guys think	8.0
	Talk to your partners	2.0
I think its obtuse	Say it out loud	2.0
Obtuse	It is obtuse	5.0
	Good	1.0
	Write down the word obtuse please	1.0
I already did	Excellent	1.0
	Did you already know that	2.0
	Good	1.0
	Then I want to hear your thinking Joey	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So lets look at B	1.0
	This time I want you guys to look at letter B	1.0
	Youre looking at angle BOX and I want you to talk with your table mates	1.0
	Do we think that one is zero to 90 90 to 180 180 to 270 and name it acute obtuse or right on the line	2.0
	You have 20 seconds to talk	1.0
	Go	1.0
Zero to 90	How do you know	9.0
I know because this one is going that like this and like Landon said its like an L if it was 90 degrees so it has to be 180 if its more up than that one because this one is kind of down  This ones straightup	I always want you to think about 90 degrees of this kind of angle that s 90 degrees it s what we re measuring against	5.0
	If something smaller if the arc is smaller than 90 degrees inside the 90 degrees we always call that acute	1.0
	So your answer honey is not going to be this 180	1.0
	One hundred eighty means it s bigger	1.0
	This is what it is	1.0
	Zero to 90 is acute	1.0
Oh I thought it was  that one is like this and it was more like	It s not how long the line segments are	1.0
	It s you re looking at where this arc is	1.0
	If the arc inside this 90degree mark that means it s less than 90 degrees	1.0
Thank you	You re welcome	1.0
	That s why we re doing this	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Let s do one more and then you guys might need to finish on your own	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Thirteen and 14 are symmetry	1.0
	Remember the lesson where we drew the lines of symmetry	2.0
No	You weren t here	1.0
	That s a good thing we re revealing huh	2.0
It was Wednesday	Remember that a line of symmetry What is a line of symmetry	8.0
	Lucas tell us what you re thinking	8.0
The first one I thought because the square if you ve got a square piece of paper you could fold it one way which will be parallel to	Like this	2.0
	If you drew a line down the middle and we folded it would the edges matchup	2.0
Then you could also do another line across	Like this	2.0
Because both lines are  all you could to do	Could there be any other lines	2.0
	What do you think	2.0
I think there should be across like through the middle	So what if I fold it from this corner to this corner like this	8.0
	If I folded that would those corners matchup	2.0
	So what does that tell us	8.0
That either one two three there s three	Three lines of symmetry	2.0
	Could there be four	2.0
Yes because it can go the other way	We folded it on this line of symmetry would the corners match up	2.0
Yes	You may	1.0
She said sometimes there could be as many lines as how many sides on a shape	Sometimes	4.0
	Look this has four sides	1.0
	Look we have one two How many lines of symmetry	8.0
Four	Look at the next figure	1.0
	The next figure has four sides and there s not four lines of symmetry	1.0
	How many lines of symmetry on the next figure	8.0
One	What s the figure called	8.0
Trapezoid	No	1.0
	Thats four sides	1.0
Trapezoid	Trapezoid	4.0
Well how would you fold it this way because this side is bigger than that side	What if we had If this is the figure	1.0
If you fold it that way it would be too big	See how it s similar to this	2.0
Why do you have that	I would fold it right here so that this corner would line up with this one	1.0
Wait because you couldn t go down the middle	You can t do it this way	1.0
	It wouldn t match	1.0
Yes because if you fold it up it will just be a little off	Exactly	1.0
	Liza	2.0
I think	What does quadrangle mean	8.0
It s a foursided shape	You got it	1.0
Then it would be a square rectangle or slanted square	Where would the line of symmetry be on C	8.0
	C looks like this	1.0
It s almost a square	What makes this not a square	8.0
Because the sides are more slanted than that	Do we have four right angles	2.0
Yes	We don t have four right angles but we have four sides	1.0
What also doesn t make any square is that a square has of four lines of symmetry and this one only has	If we folded it here what would happen	8.0
It got overlapped but	If the corners wouldn t match up perfectly that s not a line of symmetry	1.0
Unless you folded it open	On onefold	1.0
	Could we fold it here	2.0
Yes	Would this match perfectly with this	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Are there any other lines of symmetry on this shape	2.0
	Yes	2.0
Yes	What about here	2.0
Yes	Are there any others	2.0
I think we can do a line like fold it	This way	2.0
You can t fold a line down the middle	You know what my friends	2.0
	You can t	1.0
	Here	2.0
	If I folded this watch my hands	1.0
	My friends I want you to watch my hands	1.0
	Look where my finger is	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If I fold this right now watch where my hand goes	1.0
	Is it going to match up	2.0
No	No	4.0
	We cannot have a line of symmetry here	1.0
That one will come down here and then that one will come over there	What about this side	2.0
	If I put a line of symmetry here and I flipped it look where my hand would end up	1.0
	Over here	1.0
	Would it line up	2.0
No	These are the only two lines of symmetry on this figure	1.0
Like  said you can t do that way because	Ms Jackson how much	1.0
	They re okay	1.0
	We re done too	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	I m actually done	1.0
	We re in a good stopping point too	1.0
	We might still have Number 14 and 15 to do but you can do when you have some extra time	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Fourth graders high five	1.0
	Thank you so much Owen	1.0
	You turned and faced me so quickly	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Friends we have one more rotation	1.0
	Wherever you have not been that s where you re going now	1.0
	My friends  what you would want to do then is once you finish Number 10 you want to make sure that you finish the rest of whatever youre doing	1.0
	I m going to show them a tip on Number 10	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Please switch	1.0
	My friends I want to show you a tip on Number 10	1.0
	Can I see all of your papers please	1.0
	I want you to look at mine	1.0
	We re making a line plot	1.0
	Can you see mine Gage	1.0
	I want you to look right here my line plot	1.0
	You need to do your labels	1.0
	These are the data points right here	1.0
	Up here	1.0
	Look at what I started with	1.0
	What did I start with here Liza	8.0
Two and one half	Two and one half	4.0
	Your interval is half centimeters	1.0
	Two and one half three three and one half four four and one half	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Go try it	1.0
	Help each other	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Friends meet me over here	1.0
	Hi I m so excited to spend a few minutes with you guys a few more minutes	1.0
	It s a good review	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Gage where s Do you need to go seeTor you guys are at the table	1.0
Logans okay	All right	1.0
	These are pretty fun	1.0
	We re starting on Number 11	1.0
	Matthew and Noah are you ready to start with us on Number 11	2.0
Yes	Do you need a chair	1.0
	There s one right here	1.0
I understand	Is this one of your papers	1.0
That s Logan s	Logan	1.0
	Here you go honey	1.0
	Is this yours too	1.0
Yes	There you go my dear	1.0
	You re welcome	1.0
	Okay friends	1.0
	I want you guys to be the leaders	1.0
	I want you to ask	1.0
	We re going to go through these one at a time but I want you to be the leaders not me	1.0
	Emily read Number 11	2.0
	Tell us what you think we re doing	8.0
	Thank you Mia	1.0
It will be like we re making an angle	You are making the angle	5.0
	Noah tell us how you knew what to do	9.0
I drew half of a circle and an arrow at the right end	I did this with a couple of my other groups	1.0
	Noah does yours match mine	2.0
Oh but is it okay if I	Yes	1.0
Hes still moving clockwise	Yes	1.0
Hes going to the left to the right	Its okay	1.0
	Okay and B is instead of a halfturn London will you read B for us 11B	2.0
Onefourth turn counterclockwise	All right	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	If I have to write an equation	1.0
	Were going onequarter of a turn counterclockwise	1.0
Thats why	Good	1.0
	You got that	1.0
I did it like this	Smart thinking friends	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	What I want you each to do is hold up your paper so we can check each others and look at your neighbors	1.0
	Look at neighbors on both sides	1.0
	Look at your neighbors on both sides	1.0
	Matthew	1.0
	Matthew look at my counterclockwise	1.0
Oh I did it that way	I think you did clockwise honey	1.0
	See the difference	2.0
	You have to go the other direction for counterclockwise	1.0
	There you go honey	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Sam Number 12 is you	2.0
Circle the best answer	I want everyone to look at angle ABC	1.0
	Sam I want you to tell us what youre thinking	8.0
	Then ask your friends around you if they agree	3.0
I agree	Well Sam is going to tell us his thinking and then hes going to ask for someone to addon	1.0
	Okay	1.0
Its more than a hundred degrees	Great	1.0
	Call on someone to share their thinking	2.0
	They might agree disagree addon	3.0
I agree because the arrow is pointing to the right so its not turning all the way	How do we know this angle is less than 180 degrees	9.0
Its not facing it and its higher so its not going to be that	Got it	1.0
The  it makes its not one side to the other side	So 180 degrees would mean this line would be straight across	2.0
Yes	So we know its less than 180	2.0
Also	So 180 degrees would be this line all the way across right here	2.0
Its bigger than that and	No because its less than	1.0
	This arc right here is what were looking at	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes	This is 180 so we know this is more than 90 but less than 180	1.0
	You did awesome Sam	1.0
	Thank you for sharing	1.0
	I love it	1.0
I was going to say you can sometimes get confused of which way its going because or if its going this way you know its not going to be  its going the other way	True	1.0
	I see what youre saying	1.0
	I like that	1.0
	What do we name this angle	8.0
Obtuse	Obtuse	4.0
	Write it down	1.0
I thought it meant like	Because we know it is less than 180	1.0
	Hang on honey	1.0
	We have one more	1.0
	Obtuse goes here	1.0
	This is a different answer	1.0
	We can talk about it later	1.0
	Okay	1.0
I think I actually know	12B Matthew will you read it for us	2.0
	the next one	1.0
To me it looks like its the other way	What do you mean by the other way	8.0
Well not going a different way but like kind of  on the A and B	Matthew our three choices are right here zero through 90 90 to 180 or 180 to 270	1.0
If it was just slightly there past zero	Can you have someone to addon to your thinking please	3.0
I was imagining a line here and this is 90 degrees	Do you agree with Matthew that its less than 90	3.0
Yes	Youre showing why	2.0
I think it would be zero through	Can you pull this up so the other kids can see how you did that	2.0
	Do you see how Logan drew in where the 90 degrees is	1.0
Angle BOX is less than 90 degrees	And then he said	1.0
I got BOX	Finish what you were saying	2.0
I thought that is should be like zero through 89 instead of 0 through 90 because I think this is an acute angle and acute is different than	Less than 90	2.0
Yes and	I see what youre saying	1.0
A 90 is a complete different angle	Is that something	1.0
	Is that me	1.0
	Thats me	1.0
She did it so we could actually	Friends the answer is what	8.0
	What kind of angle is it and how do you name it	8.0
Its acute	Acute	4.0
	Excellent	1.0
	It is acute but its also less than 90 degrees	1.0
It is true but	Yes	1.0
	Turn the page please	1.0
	Now I want to tell you I have to run to my next group in another class but you all are responsible for doing these two symmetry problems	1.0
We can name it	Then I want to tell you that Number 15 is like what we did yesterday with multistep multiplication	1.0
	These problems right here this is A B and C for Number 13 to help you	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So thank you for your smart thinking today	1.0
	Im going to assign you 13A	1.0
	Owen youre going to show your thinking	1.0
	13B Mia	1.0
	13C Logan	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Fourteen Leo	1.0
	When youre done with 14 youre going to share your answer	1.0
Wait Owen is 13	Yes	1.0
	It goes around here	1.0
	You guys are going to have to Really put your brains together for 15	1.0
	If you guys get that far London you share 15	1.0
	Okay	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
	Thanks for working so hard	1.0
	I know I can trust you to keep going	1.0
	Okay	1.0
Because if we drew  like a bus on it	So you guys can know this is how I solved it	1.0
	Dont look at it now but you can look at it if you needed to check Number 15	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	The last thing can you guys help me at the end whenTis done	1.0
	Put these tables together and push this easel back up	1.0
	Thank you friends	1.0
	Have a great rest of your snowy day	1.0
Its kind of like an asterisk	So A were going to start with Number 2	1.0
	B youre going to watch	1.0
	Sorry Im having technical difficulties over here	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I cant see it if youre holding it to the opposite wall	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner about your painting	1.0
	Lets see if you can do what your partner did	1.0
	If youre helpful or some of you keep doing what youre doing	1.0
	Lets read the number	8.0
318500	Right break it in parts	1.0
	Thats what expanded form means youre expanding	1.0
	Okay and match	1.0
	I like the way I see some people look like branching out trying other ideas	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Share your thinking with your partner its the other persons turn to go first	2.0
	Im wondering why youre putting parentheses around that part	1.0
	Come with me	1.0
	Wait come right here	1.0
	Do you see why this person put parentheses around theirs	3.0
	Why did they have parenthesis	3.0
Because they were	Yes theyre showing this number and this separate number	1.0
	Look at this persons why are they using parentheses	3.0
They are writing the multiplication	Yes theyre showing keep this together keep this together so what do parentheses do	8.0
They keep things together	They group things dont they	2.0
	Are you trying to group this and this	2.0
No	No okay	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets try this one	1.0
	If you havent tried some other methods branch out if you are ready to branch out	1.0
	Try this one how do we say the number	8.0
07100	There you go try this one	1.0
	Why are you saying  So is that 70	2.0
	If I didnt have a one what would I call that	8.0
	Id call that seven what	8.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Talk with your partner again	2.0
	Seven times what	8.0
	What did she write	3.0
	What is that	8.0
Two	Onetenth plus one times	8.0
Because you moved that	Okay all right	1.0
	Lets try one more	1.0
	Lets say the number	8.0
90615000	There you go give that a shot	1.0
	These are really simple Hudson	1.0
	Are you trying to group that together	2.0
No	No keep the plus and keep the six but do you need the parentheses there	2.0
	Do you need that	2.0
No	No because youre not going to group	5.0
	Like if youre doing 9 x 100 youre grouping that  6 x 1 you would be grouping that does that make sense	2.0
Yes	Flash	1.0
	Not many people have it done so Ill give you a moment longer	1.0
	Five seconds and flash	1.0
	Thats better	1.0
I think Ive finished	Thank you	1.0
	Im going to have you set this on your desk	1.0
	Youre going to go with your shoulder partner to another table and look at the work at that table	1.0
	Notice Gosh do I agree with the thinking or not	1.0
	With your shoulder partner tour to another table	2.0
	Leave that slate at your table so people can look at it	1.0
	You should be with your shoulder partner	1.0
	You and your shoulder partner are traveling together so you can interact	1.0
	You need to get this	1.0
	See theyve multiplied the place values here but they didnt here	1.0
	I feel like I should have done this a little differently	1.0
	If you have a disagreement with someones work stay there so that when they return you can talk to them about their work all right	2.0
	So if you have a question youre like This part doesnt make sense to me stay there  That makes sense	2.0
Yes	All right head back to your seats unless you need to stay there to talk to them about their work	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	This is right	1.0
No I know this ones right	Okay	1.0
	This is the tenth to the zero so what should it be	8.0
6 x 10 to the 0	Or should it be 10 to go first	2.0
10 the first	Because you want one zero there right	2.0
Yes	One would be 10 to the 0	1.0
10 to the 0	Yes so it should be 10 to the 0	1.0
Youre right	Yes so that is right do you see why	2.0
It had to be a zero	No its not going to be a one its going to be a zero	5.0
	I misread what you had there	1.0
	Janessa head back to your seat so people can talk with you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	If youre waiting work the math boxes while you wait because theres a couple of conversations still going on	1.0
	You should be working on math boxes if youre back at your normal desk	1.0
	Multiply this	1.0
	All right your math message is up	1.0
	Complete problems one and two on Journal page 167 please	1.0
	Were just practicing	1.0
	In comes in switch in comes in whats 15 of 10	8.0
15 of 10	So 10 into how many groups	8.0
Two	No break it into five groups Winfred by the denominator	1.0
	So 10   5 is	8.0
25	No you multiply or something I dont know what you did	1.0
Dividing	If we have 10 counters and we had to make them into five groups how many would be in each group	8.0
Five	No wheres your	1.0
Heres again	This is one group two groups three groups four groups five groups	1.0
	This is 15	1.0
	This is what we just did with the counters remember	2.0
	You make it into five groups so how manys in	8.0
	Im confused about the talking	1.0
You said talk again	No does it say that in the directions	2.0
You talk about what you know	Got you sorry	1.0
	Thank you for understanding	1.0
	Talk to Royce	2.0
	This is what we were just doing at the table	1.0
I know	Good job	1.0
	This is the group the whole group find 15 of it	1.0
	How many groups are we making	8.0
Five	Five so 10   5 is how many	8.0
Five	Really	2.0
	Youd have five in each group	2.0
Two	Yes	1.0
	Yes so if you were done with your spheres you would have been at the health group but you needed to finish an assignment so thats why you werent there	1.0
	Now do you get what to do	2.0
Yes	You divide the big number by the only group youre putting here so 10   5 is	8.0
10   5	10   5 is 2	1.0
	So 25   2 if theres 2 in the group	1.0
	The groups are	8.0
	Good	1.0
	All right lets talk about the first table	1.0
	What would go in this place right here	8.0
	Show me	1.0
	Good	1.0
	People are showing me two	1.0
	How did you get two	8.0
	Noah	2.0
I got two because I drew a fraction circle	Why a fraction circle	9.0
	Theres 10 items and youre finding 15 of them so why a fraction circle	9.0
	Right but why a fraction circle	9.0
	Im confused about that part	1.0
but I was confused about what I was going to do so I divided	Okay	1.0
	Do you need to make a fraction circle	2.0
	No	2.0
	So how can you find 15 of any those numbers	8.0
	Everybody talk about the rules with your partner how does the rule work	8.0
	Okay Andrew what is the rule	8.0
	How does this work	8.0
You see how many groups of five	How many groups of what	2.0
Five	Yes	1.0
	Generalize that rule a little bit	1.0
	If it was 12 Ill be finding how many halves so Id be dividing that by 2	1.0
	If it was dividing by 14 I would be	1.0
	dividing it by	8.0
Four	Four	4.0
	Lets go back to the learning intention here	1.0
	I dont think I went over that	1.0
	Maybe that would help us get this	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Read this with me please	2.0
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	Lets try that again	2.0
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers	Think what that means	1.0
	Youre going to be solving a type of problem called fraction of and youre supposed to then take that and transfer it to multiplication of fractions	1.0
	Thats what theyre showing you there	1.0
	Theyre showing you some examples of multiplication of fractions	1.0
	Youre going to be successful when you can solve the problem on a certain math page okay	2.0
	Basically youre going to know youre successful when you can explain how fraction of problems connect to multiplication of fractions	1.0
	Im going to pause the lesson here and Im going to do what I did at the table with some friends as a demonstration	1.0
	If I have 10 of these counters let me count this quickly by counting them in groups of two	1.0
	2 4 6 8 10	1.0
	Heres 10	1.0
	How do I find 15 of that	8.0
	Youre going to share your idea with your face partner	8.0
	Partner A goes first	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Okay back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Where did Anferny go	1.0
Here	There you are	1.0
	Anferny how do I find 15 of 10	8.0
	So theyre right here what do I do	8.0
You find dividing the number of  for the group of two	This is my group of 10 how many groups do I make it into	8.0
	Im trying to find 15	1.0
	How many groups do I make it into	8.0
	Everybody flash me	1.0
	Five five groups one two three four five	1.0
	Why five groups	9.0
Because youre giving away a group	Im finding 15	1.0
15 of 10	So if I have 15 how many are in 15	8.0
Two	Two okay	2.0
	Now I have 10 lets add two more so now I have a total of 12	1.0
	How do I find 14 of 12	8.0
	How many groups do I need to make this into	8.0
	Show me	1.0
	Yes four so heres a group heres a group heres a group heres a group and now Im going to keep adding	1.0
	How many groups do I have	8.0
	Four	1.0
	Whats 14 of 12	8.0
	How many is 14	8.0
	Three theres three in one of these groups of four	1.0
	I get this I dont get this	1.0
	Okay because this is what I was doing at the table with my friends because thats what that in and out table is	1.0
	Thats why Im checking this with this	1.0
	Lets go back to the slide show quickly really quickly	1.0
	What is 15 of 25	8.0
	Everybody flash it to me	1.0
	Good five	1.0
	What is 15 of 15	8.0
	Flash it to me	1.0
	Great three	1.0
	What is 15 of 30	8.0
	Excellent six	1.0
	Thats 15 how does that relate to this in and out table	8.0
	Thats what you were supposed to talk about with your partner but I feel like some people didnt understand this necessarily so youre not necessarily ready for that	1.0
	Stand up if you understand this connection between this and this	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You are going to go on the rug	1.0
	Those of you that are standing go on the rug please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	My friends	1.0
	No stand up	1.0
	Stand up	1.0
	Youre not sitting stand up	1.0
	My friends that dont get it youre going to go partner with one of those people so they can talk to you about that	1.0
	You go find one of those friends to partner with	1.0
	Talk about what those connections are	8.0
	Then you could just talk this through okay	2.0
	Look at his Math Journal so that you can talk about it	1.0
	You see how theres three groups now	2.0
	If you know what 15 is that was two but then you got three of them so 2 x 3	1.0
Six	Six	4.0
	15 was five now we have three of them so 5 x 3 is 15	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes	How does this one work	8.0
	Yes try this one	1.0
15 x 10	15 of 15 is	8.0
Three	35 of 15 would be	8.0
Nine	Why	9.0
Because its three groups	So 3 x 3 would be 9 okay	2.0
	15 is 6 but you have three of them so 6 x 3 is	8.0
		1.0
	Do you get this now	2.0
	If you dont get it this will lessen the	1.0
	You get it Im not sure you do	1.0
	Do you see that youre finding one group here but now you have three of them so this is multiplying three whatever we find here	1.0
	All right thank you	1.0
	What do you notice	8.0
	Whats the connection between the two tables	8.0
	Miya	2.0
Then we do 6 x 3 which is 18	Why are we multiplying it by three	9.0
Because the rule is 35 instead of 15 so youd have to multiply it by three	Felicia	2.0
That means youll have to take the 10 in the first one and the answer was 2 and then you have to multiply it by 3 to get the out of the next one	To get three times as much I like how you said that three times as much	1.0
	Miya gets it but its hard to explain it sometimes and I think the key was three times as much	1.0
	35 is three times as much as 15	1.0
	Did you want to add to that	3.0
	Got it	2.0
	All right fabulous	1.0
	Would this be true for every number we put in these two machines	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Would this be true for every number why or why not	9.0
	Partner Bs turn to talk first youre talking with your face partner	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	I heard Kayla saying something to her partner that I think everybody should talk about	1.0
	If you did great if you didnt keep your appeal	1.0
	Kayla tell us what you were thinking	8.0
Then we thought it would be hard to then multiply that fraction or the remainder by three	Thats something to consider	1.0
	Im glad you know this they are all multiples of five	1.0
	Do you think you could make a picture that proves this rule	2.0
	To show how finding 15 of it works and how finding 13 of a whole would work	1.0
	Make a picture of that	1.0
	Finding 15 of a whole and finding 35 of a whole make a picture	1.0
	Maybe use rectangles	1.0
	Thats easier than making circles because its hard to get that even	1.0
	Make a rectangle to show finding 15 and showing 35	1.0
	There you go honey youre on the right track nice job	1.0
	So can you show your team because theyre not	3.0
	Youre on the right track show them what your thinking is	3.0
	Good job Eva youre on the right track	1.0
	Good job youre on the right track	1.0
	Good job youre on the right track	1.0
	Look at your partners	1.0
	Both of these people have it	1.0
	Theyre on the right track	1.0
	Youre on the right track	1.0
	Youre on the right track	1.0
	Youre on the right track	1.0
	Do you see how hes taking that rectangle and dividing it	3.0
	I dont know why hes dividing into twos but maybe label it 15 so that we can see	1.0
	Nice youre on the right track	1.0
	So whats 15	8.0
	Right here shade that in	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Here make another rectangle exactly the same size	1.0
	Right underneath it so you can see that its the right size	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Now make this one into 15 that show 35	1.0
	The line should match up sweetie	1.0
	Do you get it	2.0
Yes	Thats where youre doing it right underneath	1.0
	See that youre comparing the same exactly 35	1.0
	Make those same lines	1.0
	Okay youre going to talk with your face partner	2.0
	Its partner As turn to talk first and explain how that shows a 15 of a whole and the 35 of a whole	8.0
	Now multiplying the first two	1.0
	If you find 15 finding 35 is just multiplying it by three right	2.0
Yes	Good job	1.0
	Does your drawing help you to understand this	2.0
Yes	Once you find what 15 is you can add 15  15  15 or you could just multiply it by three okay	2.0
	All right fabulous	1.0
	Im good or I need to talk about it to someone	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	I see somebody brave enough to say they dont quite have it yet so were going to have somebody get up and put theirs under the document camera	1.0
	Sienna can you take yours I see that you have the right idea and its labeled	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Away goes Sienna thank you	1.0
	You can just move those babies out of your way	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Eyes up at the Ms Carter	1.0
So I shaded in 15 of it because were finding 15 and we know that its two because	Can you just count it out	2.0
	Can you go 2 4 6 8 10 to show us how that works on your first one	2.0
	No on your very first diagram show us how its two	8.0
	How do you know thats two	8.0
Then since theres three twos we want to add them all together and that would be six	What would be the number model for this	8.0
	I could see two different number models	1.0
	What would be a number model for this	8.0
	Put that on your slate please	1.0
	Lets give Sienna a round of applause	1.0
	What is a number model that shows those	8.0
	Put them on your slate	1.0
	Like 15  15  15  35 right	2.0
	That explains your model right	2.0
Yes	Or 15 x 3 yes	1.0
	I see some people doing this	1.0
	Would that work	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Would this work	2.0
	15 x 3 35 yes	1.0
	I saw some people doing this	1.0
	Is that what were doing	2.0
No	No thats how we found what 15 was but this is like matching our diagrams that we were making	1.0
	15 15  15  35	1.0
	When we found that it was two for 15	1.0
	2  2  2  6 or 2 x 3  6 right	2.0
	Theres the number model to prove our picture today	1.0
	Lets find 16 of 18	1.0
	Find 16 of 18	1.0
	Put it on your slate 16 of 18	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Explain to your partner how you found out it was three	2.0
	Partner Bs turn to talk first	2.0
I get it	Okay	1.0
Now I get it	All right so what is 56 of 18	8.0
	If you know 16 is 3 what is 56	8.0
	Put it on your slate	1.0
	If 16 is 3 what is 56	8.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You said 15 youre on the right track	1.0
	Talk with your partner how you found 15	8.0
Three	Was three	5.0
	So now you have five of that	1.0
	5 x 3  15	1.0
	Do you see why	2.0
Yes	If you know that 16 is 3	1.0
	Youre going to do it five times so thats why we just multiply 3 x 5	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes that makes sense now	Okay	1.0
	All right lets try another one	1.0
	What is 110 of 50	8.0
	And flash	1.0
Five	Good	1.0
	Its five	5.0
	How did you get five Eli	8.0
I know that 5 x10  50 and thats why I got five	I like your thinking	1.0
	Could you do it by dividing too	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Somebody that did it as division explain their thinking Rowdy	8.0
I did 50 divided 10 and I was trying to see how many groups of 10 were in 50 and I know that it is five	Nice	1.0
	Now we found 110 of 5	1.0
	Now knowing that 110 of 50 is five	1.0
	What is 710	8.0
	flash	1.0
	Good talk with your partner about why its 35	9.0
	Its 15 Reese is five but we have seven of them	1.0
	So 5 x 7 35	1.0
	Once you find what 15 is thats like the one but then you have three of them so you multiply those	1.0
Timesing the numerator	Trey back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What would the process be	8.0
	If you wanted to just go straight from if I said find 710 of 50 what would the process be	8.0
	Because Ive walked you through the process	1.0
	Youre explaining to your partner what would the process be to find 710 of 50	8.0
	What would the first step be and the second step	8.0
	Youre going to find somebody to talk to	1.0
	So stand up	1.0
	Stand up	1.0
	right here	1.0
	Right here	1.0
	This is not a good match	1.0
	We already know that you both struggle so would it be a good plan to get to people	1.0
	Because you know  I dont know if  at all but you want to  with somebody	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	So what would be the steps	8.0
	Theres two of them	1.0
	What would you do Lexie	8.0
So I thought the 50 would be so I had a dividing and multiplying and then once you know that thats five you would multiply it by seven because youre finding 710 so you would have seven fives seven times five is 35	Nicely explained	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Would this work with any whole number	2.0
	Yes finding 14 of it and then multiplying times the numerator if its finding 35	1.0
	So finding 416 whatever it is	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Youre going to write an expression on your slate to model this problem	1.0
	Do you solve it	2.0
	No	1.0
	Youre writing the expression	1.0
	If I have three sets of four coins how many coins in all	8.0
	So write the expression	1.0
	Three sets of four coins how many coins in all	8.0
	Write the expression	1.0
	How would I solve that problem	8.0
	The number model its the expression	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Good	1.0
	If you said three times four youre on the right track	1.0
	Why is it three times four Gracey	9.0
Three times four because if you have four groups of three yes it would be three times four because	Theres three groups of four	5.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets try it again	1.0
	If you have eight rows of eight stamps how many stamps in all	8.0
	Whats the expression	8.0
	Eight rows of eight stamps	8.0
	And flash	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner about why thats eight times eight	9.0
is eight times eight	Because theres eight	2.0
Yes because	All right	1.0
	Back to me	1.0
	Emma why is it eight times eight	9.0
It will be eight times eight because youre basically taking the two numbers from the problem then multiplying them	Okay	1.0
	Thats true but why is it eight times eight	9.0
Itll also be eight times eight because you have eight stamps and eight rows	So theres a group of eight eight different times	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Thats what Im looking for not just you saying again its eight times eight	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets try one more	1.0
	Six bags of 12 oranges	1.0
	How many oranges in all	8.0
	And flash	1.0
Me I know	Good	1.0
	If you explained first last time you explain second this time	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	Go	1.0
12 oranges	Theres six bags	1.0
	So you just put 12 in these bags	1.0
	Right	1.0
I found a way  and I got back at where its 60	Not exactly	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Why is it six times 12	9.0
	David	2.0
Six times 12	Why is it six times 12	9.0
	Why is six bags of oranges with 12 in each bag six times 12	9.0
Because there are six bags with 12 oranges in each	That will tell you how many in all	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	What operation are we using in each of these examples	8.0
	Yay	1.0
	Were all multiplying	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now were going to involve the fraction piece with this	1.0
	Are you ready	2.0
	What is 34 of a bag of carrots	8.0
	What is 34 of a bag of carrots	8.0
	Whats the expression for that	8.0
	34 of a bag of carrots	8.0
	34 of a bag of eight carrots	8.0
	Did I say it wrong	2.0
You said	Sorry	1.0
	Im rattled	1.0
	Im looking at the clock and going Ive got to change something about what Im doing here	1.0
	34 of a bag of eight carrots	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Im glad	1.0
	I see most people getting the hang of this	1.0
	If you have 34 times eight youre on the right track	1.0
	Talk with your partner about why its 34 times eight	9.0
Well	solving this	1.0
	Youre supposed to be multiplying	1.0
	You are giving me the expression 34 of eight	1.0
	I dont know why	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Did you already talk yet	2.0
eight times 34 because	Okay	1.0
	Back to me	1.0
	Why is it represented as 34 times eight	9.0
	Why is it represented that way Emma	9.0
Its represented that way because you have 34 of one bag that has eight carrots	Okay	1.0
	True	1.0
	Who can elaborate on this	3.0
	Who can explain this a little more	3.0
	Brandon	2.0
Well its not the opposite Im just saying its not 10 times 15 its like 15 of 10	Kaya	2.0
Another way to really to visualize it is if youre thinking of one whole and one whole times itself so if youre multiplying one whole by 34 youre then getting 34 of the whole	That is actually going to be 34 of the whole as being eight	1.0
	I like your thinking	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I get what youre saying	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Im going to just turn you loose but Im going to have you work with your partner	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Youre going to work on the rest of that page 167 where your math message was	1.0
	Working together	1.0
	Working together	1.0
	Should one person be dominating	1.0
No	No	4.0
	Working together	1.0
	Take turns	1.0
	I hesitate to say sage and scribe	1.0
	Work them together	1.0
	Share your thinking working and checking sage and scribing discussing	1.0
	Were going to come back in a few minutes	1.0
	If you finish I do have a game	1.0
13 of 12 and then we just times that by three	By two because its 23 but you have it	5.0
	Nice job	1.0
13 of six is	13 of 12 is four but they have 23	1.0
So four times two would be eight	Yes	1.0
	You see your fix up there	1.0
I think  are erasable	Yes because you wouldnt be allowed to use it even if it works	1.0
Yes	Great	1.0
	Keep working together	1.0
Three	I cut the side of each half	1.0
	If you have six of these heres six whats 13	8.0
13 would be	No thats 23	1.0
	Thats half	1.0
	We can make this into three groups	1.0
	Right	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	You have three groups	1.0
	So whats 13	8.0
Two	Two but you have 23 so that would be	8.0
Eight	One	1.0
	Two	1.0
	This is one group	1.0
	This is another group	1.0
	This is now 23	1.0
	So how much is that	8.0
Four	You see why its four	2.0
Yes	You divided this into three groups you found 13 first but you had two of them	1.0
	So one group plus another group is 23 because two times two is four	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now you have a total of 12	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Two four six eight	1.0
	How many more do I need	8.0
	One more	2.0
	Heres four more so now I have 12	1.0
	Do you see that	2.0
	Two four six eight 10 12	1.0
	Whats 13 of this	8.0
	How many groups do we make that into if were making a third	8.0
	There you go	1.0
	Three groups	1.0
	13 is four but we need 23	1.0
	You just divided it into half	1.0
	This is 13	1.0
	13 plus 13 is how many thirds	8.0
	23 right	2.0
	So how many is in 23	8.0
	Were going to do one more	1.0
	Heres nine	1.0
	Whats 13 of nine	8.0
	Play the game	1.0
	Its called Fraction of	1.0
	You can get on your computer to play it	1.0
	Its Fraction of	1.0
	Thats what you do next Fraction of	1.0
	Good	1.0
	So 13 is how many	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	So 23 is	8.0
Six	There you go	1.0
	Is that making sense Lucas	2.0
	Okay	1.0
Were doing all that	No	1.0
	Were going to play the game	1.0
	Look at the clock	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
How much is	14 of eight eight divided by four is two	1.0
	Thats for 14 but you have three of them	1.0
	Youre trying to find 34	1.0
	14 is two but you have three of them	1.0
	So	1.0
Oh this will be times three	Two times three is	8.0
It would be	Two times three is	8.0
Two times its six	Can you see why	2.0
	You are only finding 14	1.0
	You have to find this 14 to help you find the 34	1.0
	You are doing the same thing	1.0
	You found 14 because if you have eight things	1.0
Oh so now I have to find 34 Oh okay	Do you see what your fix up is	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Im just going to grab something	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I dont know what were doing here	1.0
	Talk to me about this	1.0
	Whats 14 of eight	8.0
14 of eight	Yes	1.0
Two	Good but you have 3 4	1.0
	So if you know 14 is two what would 34 be	8.0
That is multiplication	Right	1.0
	Thats what multiplication is finding fraction of	1.0
Oh so its kind of the same thing	Right	1.0
	Remember what we just did on this slate where we said Four bags of oranges eight rows of stamps eight rows of groups of stamps	2.0
	Do you see why its still multiplication	2.0
Yes	I dont think I was really explicit	1.0
	14 is two so 34 would be	8.0
Two	Not two	5.0
Yes two times	14 is two	5.0
It should be two times three	Uhhuh	1.0
	Do you see why its six	2.0
	Because 14 is two but you have 34	1.0
Then you got to times it with that	Yes	1.0
	You have four here but that doesnt make sense because that would be half of this	1.0
	Thats how I knew Oops there is a little fixup	1.0
	Whats 14 of eight	8.0
	But you have three of them so	8.0
Its six	So whats 14 of 10	8.0
	Twenty divided by four is	8.0
Five	Five	4.0
	Thats 15 or 14 but you have three of them	1.0
	See how we went from 15 to 35	2.0
	Thats what youre doing here	1.0
	Whats 14 of 16	8.0
Four	But you have three of them so you have	8.0
Twelve	You got this	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Weve got some problems here friends	1.0
	I love the effort	1.0
	Nice job with trying	1.0
	Lets talk about this	1.0
	If I have eight things I want to find 14 of them	1.0
	Whats 14 of eight	8.0
14 of eight would be four	No thats half because 2 x 4  8	1.0
	So two is 14 but you have 34	1.0
	So 2 x 3 is	8.0
Six	Six	4.0
	You dont need to put six over four	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So whats 14 of 20	8.0
No	Twenty divided by four is	8.0
Four	Four times four is 16	5.0
	Thats four times five	1.0
	Four times five is 20	1.0
	So five is 14 but how many fourths do we have	8.0
Three	Five times three is	8.0
Fifteen	Fifteen	4.0
	We have  15	1.0
Yes exactly	See how were finding the unit fraction of 14 and then well find times three because theres 34	2.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Mmhmm	Okay	1.0
	So talk me through this	1.0
	14 of 16 is	8.0
Four	Good	1.0
	So then three of those would be	8.0
Would be 12	Yes 12 because you have fourths	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Twenty is	1.0
Now you have	You divide it by four first so 20 divided by four is	8.0
	Because five times four is 20	1.0
	Therefore	1.0
Seven	Seven	4.0
	So seven 14 but we have three of those	1.0
	So seven times three is	8.0
Seven times three is 21	Perfect	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Now you need to find this strategy down here because this is  fraction	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Does that help	2.0
Yes	You guys seem like a really positive group and youre actually working	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Yes	1.0
Do you think five and six	Yes	1.0
	Good job you guys	1.0
	It looks like youve got this figured out now	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Would you need counters to do them all	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im just curious	1.0
	You guys having fun	1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Now you need two  Are we in number six	1.0
Maybe Ill	I love it	1.0
	You have the 30 pairs of shoes	1.0
	Thats our group thats our whole	1.0
	Right	1.0
	One week they have a sale and sold 810 of those	1.0
	I want to find what 110 is	1.0
	Whats 110 of 30	8.0
	Three right	2.0
	Because three times 10 would be 30	1.0
	Thats 110 but I have 810	1.0
	So three times eight is	8.0
Sixteen	Twentyfour	1.0
Yes	Twentyfour	1.0
	So thats 24 810 would be 24	1.0
	How many pairs of shoes	8.0
	Oh I already did it	1.0
	I did it	1.0
	It would be 24 pairs of shoes	1.0
	Whats the number	1.0
The number we found	810 times	8.0
810 times 30	Right 30	5.0
	Yes	1.0
	Youre right	1.0
	Thirty	1.0
	This is a line for fraction	1.0
	Right	1.0
	810 here its a normal number on a line	1.0
	There you go like	1.0
Was it 30 or 10	Thirty because its finding a group of whole	5.0
	All right	1.0
	Back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I appreciate everybody in here	1.0
	Thank you for people that were struggling and didnt give up	1.0
	Thank you for people that werent struggling that were patient	1.0
	The needs in this room are this wide and its hard sometimes to meet these needs effectively	1.0
	I need	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So thank you for being patient and working through this	1.0
	Lets go back to the learning intention here	1.0
	Lets find it there we go	1.0
	I will know Im successful when I can solve problem four on page 167	1.0
	Problem four on page 167	1.0
	Lets just run through those answers so you can see if you got it right	1.0
	Youre on page 167	1.0
	What is the out for eight	8.0
	Flash it to me	1.0
	Some people are not getting this right	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	If you said six youre right	1.0
	Were on number four checking our work so you know if youre successful or not	1.0
	What is the out for 20	8.0
	If you are showing me 15 youre right	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	The out for 16	8.0
	If youre showing me 12 youre right	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Then the out for 28	8.0
	If youre showing me 21 you are correct	1.0
	So based on this when you say a four that means you could teach somebody else how to do it	1.0
	I might not be able to teach it but I do know what Im doing or Im getting parts of this	1.0
	Im still trying	1.0
	Show me how you did with todays work	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Im going to bring your homework around	1.0
Hi my name is Kai	All right	1.0
	Please put your name on your homework	1.0
	I am going to dictate a fraction and you need to write three fractions that are equivalent to the fraction I give you	1.0
	You have a strategy that might help somebody to do this when they are not sure	1.0
	Talk at your teams	1.0
	If you have an idea for the strategy share that out	1.0
	Ill deal with your team	1.0
	What would be an efficient way to generate those fractions Brody G	8.0
Using the multiplication maam	Okay so whats the saying that we have for that	8.0
Whatever youre do to the top you do to the bottom	Yes or vice versa  whether its the bottom first top first whichever all right	2.0
	Here we go	1.0
	The first fraction is one third and that left three equivalent fractions on your slate here	1.0
	You dont need to write down the whole process just put the fractions	1.0
	Somebody have an extra slate	1.0
	It looks like TJ didnt get his slate back	1.0
	Does anybody have an extra slate running around in their desk	1.0
	Some of my friends may have put them in their desks from our club yesterday	1.0
	No maybe somebody might have taken them home	1.0
I dont know	Probably not	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Remember youre generating three okay	2.0
	Im going to have you share with your face partner	2.0
	Check each others work	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Just three each time thank you	1.0
	Youre going to share with your face partner	2.0
	If you shared first last time share second this time please	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you this time share with your face partner	2.0
	The other  to go through	1.0
	Rate how well you can find equivalent fractions using our multiplication rule thank you	2.0
	Whats the point of having an equivalent fraction	9.0
	Think back to our learning intention that weve been working with	1.0
	Why do we want equivalent fractions	9.0
	What were we doing last week with them	8.0
	Im trying to find that	1.0
	What were we doing	8.0
	Why do we need an equivalent fraction	9.0
	Theres a hint up on the slide	1.0
	Look to your shoulder partner	1.0
	Partner I bHuntereve goes first	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	What is one use for equivalent fractions Samantha	8.0
That way you can use the multiplication rule or the common denominators to look through that when you want to figure out how much total	I love the way people are feedbacking thank you	1.0
	Thanks for bringing the real world to it	5.0
	I like that too	1.0
	What would be another use thats not having to do with adding and subtracting	8.0
	River did you have an idea of another use that wasnt adding and subtracting	8.0
When you find a different answer to something else and you dont want to use the same answer like everybody else is using you could do that	Why would we want to do that	9.0
	Im just curious	1.0
	I like that you came up with something good job but why would you want to do that	9.0
It doesnt answer  know it  and you want to try something different	Okay	1.0
	Youve come up with different equivalent fractions	1.0
	Who had a different way thank you River that wasnt adding and subtracting	8.0
	Anybody have a different idea	8.0
	Think for a minute	1.0
	What would be another use of having equivalent fractions	8.0
	ALexis	2.0
You could  into half instead of	More comprehensible easy to use good point	1.0
	Hunter	2.0
I said if you had to add to two eighths	No other than adding and subtracting buddy	1.0
	Thats what I was saying not using adding and subtracting	1.0
	Thank you for trying	1.0
	Ainsley	2.0
You could use equivalent fractions to find common denominators	Im not sure how that works	1.0
	Youre saying generate a list of fractions	2.0
	What are you saying	8.0
The equivalent fraction you could find the common denominator with them	Yes like we did in the journal pages	2.0
	Where we brainstormed a list of equivalent fractions and then we found two that were the same denominators so we could work with them	1.0
	Last idea	1.0
	Victoria	2.0
Sometimes doing a common denominator helps you really visualize how much you might need to find ones that	You cant necessarily picture what 50 thousandths looks like so you put it in lowest terms it might actually be more meaningful and do that for other fractions	2.0
Yes	I was thinking comparing fraction	1.0
	When they say Put these fractions in order one third two fifths ninetenths	1.0
	Sometimes its hard to know	1.0
	If you put them in common denominators youd be able to compare the fractions youd know because theyd all have the same denominator and you just look up a numerator to decide	1.0
	There are some ideas for relevance	1.0
	Lets just quickly review	1.0
	Todays learning intention is the one from yesterday	1.0
	Read it with me please	2.0
How to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions	We were using the words factors and multiples yesterday	1.0
	Think about the success criteria and then well review that vocabulary	1.0
	Here we go	2.0
I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	Are you going to rely on only one way to do this	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Weve learned one way	1.0
	Whats another way you could do that using fraction circles	8.0
	How could you use fraction circles to find a common denominator	8.0
	Youre going to work with your shoulder partner see if you can use fractions to	1.0
	All right youre going to show your partners across from you the equivalent things you came up with and explain that process	1.0
	The team closest to the west wall will explain first	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	All right back to me please	1.0
	Would this be a very efficient way to come up with equivalent fractions	2.0
No	It definitely helps you see it for sure right	2.0
Yes	Lets look at the slide to refresh your mind about factors and factor pairs	1.0
	We were thinking about what are factors so you can explain it	1.0
	Stop worrying about your manipulatives	1.0
	Focus on the slide	1.0
	What are factors	8.0
	You re going to talk with your face partner	2.0
	Partner A goes first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What is a factor	8.0
Factor pairs are like different numbers that go into a specific number like 36 in that case so that two numbers that make that a 36	Do you see people not sure	2.0
	Do you people agreeing	3.0
	Some people that want to add to it	3.0
	Can you pick somebody that wants to add to it	2.0
Reading about it its numbers that are always going to make up another one	Clay	2.0
Five would be a factor and four would be a factor of 20	What was different about Brody s explanation compared to some of our explanations	3.0
	Think about how were they different	1.0
	Tatum how was Brodys explanation different	3.0
Because he gave detail and really explained the definition of factor pair	Using	3.0
Using vocabulary	Using the vocabulary	1.0
	Like I heard him say the word You multiply	1.0
	or I heard him talk about product	1.0
	I heard him talk about the word factors	1.0
	He gave an example that labeled that and explained it	1.0
	I think that made it more comprehensible because Ive heard people saying its numbers that make up a number	1.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thank you Brody for bringing that clearly to us	1.0
	Thank you everybody for participating	1.0
	Think about our game Buzz that we played before we started now	1.0
	What does the game Buzz have to do with this	8.0
	Which vocabulary word were you practicing in a way when you were playing Buzz	8.0
	Thumbs up if you have an idea	2.0
	Go ahead pocket your team	1.0
	Start with person three sharing their thinking first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Back to me	1.0
	What is the vocabulary word that were practicing fo the game Buzz	8.0
	Janessa	2.0
	Here s a hint starts with an M The slide is up that might help you	1.0
Multiply	Multiples	5.0
	Everybody say that	2.0
Multiples	How is playing Buzz practicing multiples	8.0
	How s that game practicing that Miguel	8.0
because those are the multiples of three	Nice thank you	1.0
	All right nice review	1.0
	Lets go to the actual lesson	1.0
	I feel like we re going to do really well because of your review	1.0
	I know you worked harder here	1.0
	Yesterday I think we did 12 and 20 didn t we	2.0
Yes	Now we have 29	1.0
	Write down what are the factors of 29	1.0
	The factors of 29	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Why could I be so quick	9.0
	Why do I expect you to just generate that so rapidly Samantha	9.0
Because 29 is a prime number so it s only divisible by one and itself	Yes	1.0
	Theres no other number factors for it	1.0
	Its not an even number	1.0
	You know that three isnt going to go into it	1.0
	You know four isn t	1.0
	You should know boom	1.0
	I like your word prime	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Now I want you to come up with some multiples for 29	1.0
	Come up with three multiples of 29	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Id like you to talk at your teams about your multiples and your strategy for finding the multiples	8.0
	Start with Person four sharing	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Let s hear a strategy you used	1.0
	Team B what was the strategy you used to generate those	8.0
Well I just kept adding 29 to the next number	People are agreeing excellent	1.0
	All right lets move on here	1.0
	Good review here	1.0
	Can you see this through the organ	1.0
	We have two thirds plus five ninths	1.0
	What do you notice about that problem Fransisco	8.0
Theyre not equivalent	Do you have to only add equivalent fractions	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Theyre not equivalent is true but thats not what Im not wanting you to pay attention to	1.0
	Youre right theyre not equivalent	1.0
	What do you notice about these two fractions Gabrielle	8.0
That they both have unlike denominators	All right because thats why we keep finding equivalent fractions so we can rename them all right	2.0
	I want you to list several equivalent fractions for each addin	1.0
	On your slate list several equivalent fractions for two thirds and several equivalent fractions for five ninths	1.0
	If you find that you have an equivalent fraction that has the same denominator for both then youll know youre ready to stand up	1.0
	Thats how you know youve generated or not	1.0
	All right I see some people not standing so Im going to have you have a conversation at your team about the equivalent fractions that youve generated	1.0
	Talk at your teams	2.0
	The person thats standing should talk to the team struggling with	2.0
	What fractions do you see that have the same denominator	8.0
	What are the two fractions Asher	8.0
Six ninths and five ninths	Thank you	1.0
	What do you notice about the starting denominators	8.0
	What do you notice about the starting denominators three and nine and the common denominator nine	8.0
	What do you notice about them	8.0
	Hunter	2.0
So what I noticed about them is theyre equivalent because three times three will become nine	Okay	1.0
	People are agreeing with your statement	1.0
	You want to add on to it Melody	3.0
You wouldnt have to multiply five ninths by anything because you can just do the twothirds multiply that by three then itll give you Both the denominators would be nine	Thank you	1.0
	Thats exactly right once you see that its the same denominator youre done	1.0
	You dont need to keep generating	1.0
	Some of you figured that out immediately	1.0
	Some of you still kept making a list	1.0
	Youre just looking until you find one that has the common denominator	1.0
	Once you find that common one then you can go ahead and work with it	1.0
	Five ninths plus sixth ninths is that what the two fractions were	2.0
	Then you add them together	1.0
	Could we use multiplication rule to find the equivalent fraction	2.0
	Lets see if theres a slide for that	1.0
	No its not on here	1.0
	Could we use the multiplication rule	8.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	That same idea to generate them	1.0
	I think thats what a lot us used	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Remember you have to have common denominators so you can add and subtract them	1.0
	Lets try another one	1.0
	Heres two thirds plus one fifths	1.0
	Make a list of equivalent fractions for each addin	1.0
	When you start to see that they have the same denominator then stand up	2.0
	You need to make sure your teams talk about why you stopped and what you could do with your problem next after youve found that	1.0
	All right how would this be help you be able to solve the equation or the addition problems Diana	8.0
So	I agree with that because you cant really add fractions that have the denominator  its tricky	1.0
	Theres another way were going to talk about it real quick  because some people are just going to come and join me at the table needs some help	1.0
	Read this with me	2.0
Quick common denominator or QCD	Yes you see where they get that name to see  common denominator	1.0
	So quick common denominator for threesevenths and seveneighths	1.0
	In order to do that you just multiply the two denominators together because then you know that the product theyre both to go into it	1.0
	What would seven times eight be	8.0
	Fraction to be  people telling me 56 and wont go away nice job	1.0
	What is the common denominator of onefourth and twothirds	8.0
	Pass it to me	1.0
	Great	1.0
	I see people telling me its  12	1.0
	What is the quick common denominator for onetenth and threefifths	8.0
	Gosh	1.0
	Good just multiplying those two denominators you do that quick common denominator	1.0
	Now think about this	1.0
	Why would this strategy work	9.0
	Explain in terms of factors and multiples	1.0
	Just because you know that common denominator you have to know what to do with it	1.0
	Asher why would this work instead of the factors and multiple	9.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner about your idea	2.0
	Make sure youre explaining in terms of factors and multiples	1.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Then I would multiply the denominator by three	1.0
	What would I  so what well multiply the numerator by	8.0
	Then we have there two fractions	1.0
	Why does this strategy work	9.0
	factors and multiples	1.0
You dont have to keep	Use the word factors and multiples you know that theyre both	1.0
You know that theyre both factors of 50	There you go	1.0
You dont have to keep finding the multiples of You dont have to use multiplication to get all the way to 50	What do you guys think	3.0
	Now are you done once you know that the common denominator is 50	2.0
No	No	4.0
	You know the new denominator what do you have to do to find the numerator	8.0
	Show me a	1.0
	How are you going to know what to multiply it by	8.0
	Lets talk about the one thats onefourth and twothirds because thats a nice small number	1.0
	What did I multiply 4 by to get the product of 12	8.0
	Really like the way people are showing me	1.0
	I multiplied the denominator by three	1.0
	What do I multiply the numerator by	8.0
	Three	2.0
	Why did I multiply the denominator three by to get the product of 12	9.0
	What do I need to do to the numerator	8.0
	Multiply by	8.0
Four	Four	4.0
	I get what to do with this I need more practice fabulous	1.0
	I am going to have you use sage and scribe	1.0
	You are going to be on page 157 could you please turn to that and  Liza I want you want you to be on 156	1.0
	Were going to skip the parts at the top where we summarize I feel weve summarized all through the lesson	1.0
	Go to the middle part  read these directions together	2.0
	Used any of these strategies on common denominators rewrite each fraction using their common denominators then solve	1.0
	Look at the first example	1.0
	Were on 1a	1.0
	See how we have twoninth and fivesixth	1.0
	They found the common denominator of 18 so did they use the quick common denominator method	1.0
	No	1.0
	They probably generated some fractions	1.0
	Some of you that know your math cats can probably find that common denominator because you know your factors of your numbers or you know your multiples of your numbers	1.0
	They came up with a common denominator of 18	1.0
	How did they turn twoninths into foureighteens	8.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	How did they know that twoninths is equivalent to twoeighteens	8.0
	How did they know that twoninths was equivalent to foureighteens	8.0
	Micha	2.0
You multiplied it by two	Multiply both the numerator and denominator by two	2.0
Yes	Nicely done	1.0
	I get what to do on this page I dont get it	1.0
	Youre saging and scribing so are both people writing	1.0
No	One person writes while the others  then you switch roles	1.0
	Are you going to have every problem solved out on that page	1.0
No	When you and your partner are done with 156 you can check in with each other	1.0
	How are you feeling	2.0
	I feeling like I know what Im doing Oh I could use some more help	1.0
	Youre both still Feelingthe same	1.0
	Then you decide do you want to use the sage and scribe or do you want to use the work and check	1.0
	If one persons not Feelingcomfortable should you do work and check	1.0
No	Youd want to keep saging and scribing to get that comfortable feeling	1.0
	Why shouldnt that What should you do on these two pages	1.0
Theres	If all people need help then youd want to come to the table	1.0
	Ready go	2.0
	All right back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets go back to our learning intensive	1.0
	I will use factors and multiples	1.0
I will know I am successful when I can I find the strategy to identify common denominators and the same time different strategies work	Did you meet this and how well did you meet it	2.0
	For your column work you feel like having your math journal at home as a resource is helpful to you thats fine but make sure you bring it back	1.0
	Your parents did not sit through this lesson they arent going to know what you are practicing	1.0
	Do your parents have another idea possibly of a strategy	2.0
Yes	Is it okay to listen to another strategy	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	So dont tell your parents Look thats not how	1.0
	That always sets off a grouchy tone to a homework help	1.0
	Maybe hearing it a different way will help you understand it	1.0
	So be open to their ideas	1.0
	Let s make sure we know what the homework is	1.0
	You get a copy put your name on it	1.0
	When you get a copy of the homework put your name on it make your	1.0
	Make you  following directions  follow directions	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets all read number one directions here we go	2.0
For each share of fractions in the table find the common denominator then rewrite the two fractions as equivalent fractions with a common denominator write greater than or less than in the same  to create a true number of	Do you see the table	2.0
	Do you see all of those steps there for you	2.0
	Questions about what you fill in each of those different sections of the table	2.0
	I like that youre cleaning up but I prefer you could you to wait until we go over this homework please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets look at their reminders for us	2.0
Remember the three strategies you have learnt list equivalent fractions check to see if one denominator is a multiple of the other denominator or multiply denominators to get quick common denominators	Those are the ones we practiced	1.0
	Questions on number one	1.0
	Lets look at the next set of directions	1.0
	Use the tables to help you rewrite the problems with common denominators then solve	1.0
	Questions about that	2.0
	If this top part takes more than lets say 15 minutes then you dont have to do the practice down at the bottom	1.0
	So if its like a normal thing for you to just whip this baby out in like five minutes go ahead and do the practice at the bottom	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	I dont want this dominating your life should just be practice shouldnt be I have to relearn this whole thing	1.0
	Like I said before if you want to take your math journal home as your resource feel free but just make sure you bring it back	1.0
	Thank you for your hard work before you join up on the	1.0
	Hello	1.0
Hello	Well see how this works	1.0
	We left off with this problem yesterday and I said we were going to finish it today	1.0
	You win an online auction for concert tickets	1.0
	Your winning bid of 120 is 60 of the maximum	1.0
	How much more were you willing to pay for tickets	8.0
	I think a lot of you had part of this done but you didnt think about the entire problem	1.0
	Go ahead and talk with your neighbor again	2.0
	Find the problem	1.0
Hello	How many of you guys have your answer	2.0
	What did we do to get the answer	8.0
	Megan whatd you guys do first	8.0
We wrote	Youve got to write the numbers in	1.0
	Where are we going to put the numbers	8.0
120 is	Oh my God	1.0
	We only paid for part of what we were willing to pay	1.0
	Do we know how much we were willing to pay yet	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Lets see first off	1.0
Then youre going to simplify	Simplify that with	8.0
Then you have to cross multiply so six equals X 6X	So 6X	2.0
And then 120 times  and then you have to divide 1200 by six and you have to divide 6X by six to get	I have to get the X all lonely and sad by itself	1.0
	So X is equal to 200	1.0
	What does that 200 represent	8.0
	Because that is not the answer	1.0
	What does the 200 represent	8.0
	Scott	2.0
	Its how much you are willing to pay	1.0
	You were willing to pay up to 200	1.0
	Did you pay 200	2.0
No	No	4.0
	So the question says how much more were you willing to pay than you actually paid	8.0
	Oh theres one more step	1.0
	We have to read our questions carefully	1.0
	How much more	8.0
	If you were willing to pay 200 but you only paid 120 how are you going to figure out how much more	8.0
	Andrew	2.0
You would have to subtract 120 from 200	Youre going to subtract 120 from 200 and you get 80	5.0
	The answer is 80	1.0
	Youve got to read the questions carefully	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You are going to work with your partner or the people around you	2.0
Is that what his name is	Okay	1.0
	Yesterday 15 of the 120 sixth graders at a school were late	1.0
	How many sixth graders were on time	8.0
Microphone	All right	1.0
	It looks like most of you have come up with an answer	1.0
	Theres your answer	1.0
	If you did not get that you need to look back at your work and figure out why did you not get a 102	9.0
One hundred two	One hundred two isnt 15	5.0
Can I explain why	No	1.0
	Kyan read the problem	2.0
Oh yes	you did not get 102	1.0
	You need to figure out why you didnt get 102	1.0
I did get 102	If you got 18 figure out why its not 18	1.0
	All right	1.0
	How did I get 102	8.0
	How did I get 102	8.0
	Grant	2.0
Then you do 1800 divided by 100 which is 18 and then you do that minus or you do 120 minus 18 you get 102	Awesome	1.0
	Anybody get this a different way	3.0
	Okay	1.0
	So if Im thinking about this problem I know that 15 were late and its asking how many were on time 15 were late what percent were on time	8.0
His sneeze turned it off	You sneezed it off	1.0
	That pretty sure he did	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	please	1.0
	If I need to I can just fill in other classes and not this one if were just going to focus on that	1.0
	If 15 were late what percent were on time	8.0
Eightyfive	Kyan where did you get 85	8.0
Because 100 minus 15	Right 100 is all the kids at school	5.0
	If 15 were late that means the rest of them are on time	1.0
	Thats 85	1.0
	You could have done it like this	1.0
	You could have said X120  85100	1.0
	When you did that youd get a 100X  10200 and then you divide by 100 you get that X  102	1.0
	You could have done it that way as well	1.0
	You couldve figured out the percentage the opposite way and then figured out your proportion either way works thinking about that	1.0
	Youre done	2.0
	All right	1.0
	In a parking lot 16 of the cars are blue	1.0
	There are four blue cars in the parking lot	1.0
	How many cars in the parking lot are not blue	8.0
	Youve got this problem	1.0
I got 25	What is the number of cars that are not blue	8.0
	Thats what its asking	1.0
	Andrew what did you do	8.0
Then we divide both of them with 15 and got 25 then after that	Okay	1.0
	Freeze	1.0
	What does 25 represent Andrew	8.0
It represents how many cars there are	The total number of cars in the parking lot	5.0
	We know theres 25 in there	1.0
	Then what would you have to do	8.0
Youd have to subtract four and then get 21	So the total number of cars minus the four blue ones equals the rest of the cars that are not blue	1.0
	So you could have answered how many cars are in the parking lot	8.0
	Twentyfive	1.0
	We know four blue	1.0
	We know 21 are not blue	1.0
	We dont know how many are red or anything right	2.0
	All right	1.0
	A little parking lot	1.0
	Maybe just like a Walmart parking lot like at midnight	1.0
	You spent 160 at Target on holiday clearance items	1.0
	That is 25 of the total price of the items youve purchased before they were on clearance	1.0
	How much would you have spent before the clearance	8.0
	If you would have bought them at full price how much would you have spent	8.0
	Just work on the math	1.0
	Just work on	1.0
	Is it the part or the whole	8.0
I think its the part because like the whole is like how much you compare it for	Is working together	2.0
What did you get	All right	1.0
	Looks like were done with this one	1.0
	You spent 116 at Target on holiday clearance items	1.0
	That is 25 of the total price of the items	1.0
	So did you pay part of the total or the whole total	8.0
Part	Part	4.0
	We know that the 116 is our per we dont know the whole and we know the 116 is 25 of the whole price	1.0
	Kids when you look at your proportion and you think about your two numerators the whole oh I know what that color	1.0
	The whole price if you pay the whole price youre paying 100 so those kind of go together	1.0
	We only paid 25	1.0
	That is the part 116 is 25 so they kind of go together	1.0
	Then did anyone simplify this first	2.0
Well I did a different one	Oh yes	1.0
	I did	1.0
	I would have simplified this to 14 as well	1.0
	It makes the math a whole lot easier	1.0
	So thats 14 and then you just have one times X which is X equals 4 x 116 is 464	1.0
	Theres your answer right there	1.0
	I didnt even have to do the division anymore because I already did it here when I simplified	1.0
	The original cost was 464 not 464	1.0
	I saw a few give their answer in percent	1.0
	Your answer is 464	1.0
	If you had to pay full price how much would you have spent before the clearance	8.0
	If you went to Target and you bought all of that not on clearance you wouldve had to pay 464	1.0
	Questions	2.0
Nope	Okay	1.0
	Theres no subtracting in this one	1.0
	It didnt say how much more would you have paid	1.0
	It just says how much would you have paid	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Go ahead and take a standandstretch break for a minute	1.0
	You can either count to 21	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Finish it up	1.0
	Return to your seats	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	A restaurant serves you a 16fluidounce glass of juice that is 30 ice	1.0
	How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get	8.0
	The ice takes up some space	1.0
	Then if the ice is in there that space that it takes up you cant get juice for that space	1.0
	How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get of the 16 ounces	8.0
	You said a hundred I thought you said a hundred and eight	1.0
It found you	The answer is not	1.0
Its not 32 ounces	Okay	1.0
	So when you get your answer you have to think about it because Ive heard multiple people got 32	1.0
	You cannot have more juice in the glass than the glass can hold	1.0
	If it holds 16 your answer cannot be bigger than 16	1.0
	If you pour more than 16 ounces of juice in your glass its going to spill all over	1.0
	So your answer cannot be bigger than 16	1.0
I even made a couple of mistakes	Okay	1.0
	So we have a glass of juice or a glass 30 of it is ice	1.0
	How many ounces are ice	8.0
	How many ounces are taken up of that 16 with ice	8.0
	48 thats what that 48 is	5.0
	What percent if 30 is ice what percent is juice	8.0
Seventy	Seventy	4.0
	So you could have done X16  70	1.0
	You could do that to find out how much is juice	1.0
	So 10X  11210 X  112	1.0
	That would tell you how much juice it is or you could have gotten the 48 and then what do you have to do with your 48	8.0
Subtract it	Subtract it from the 16 because youre taking away the space of the ice is taking up	5.0
	Questions on that one	2.0
	Just think about your answers	1.0
	48 ounces of juice in that full glass is not very much	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	A sixth grader weighs 90 pounds which is 120 of what he weighed in fourth grade	1.0
	How much did he weigh in fourth grade	8.0
	Is your answer before you start	1.0
Hes gained some weight	Stop talking	1.0
	Is your answer going to be more or less than 90 pounds	8.0
Less	Less because he gained weight	5.0
	It says hes bigger because hes 120 of what he weighed in fourth grade	1.0
	Your answer needs to be smaller than 90	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Figure it out with your partner	2.0
How can he weigh 75 pounds	All right	1.0
	How much did this sixthgrader weigh when he was in fourth grade	8.0
Seventyfive	Seventyfive what	8.0
Pounds	Please label your answer guys 75 pounds	5.0
	This is a really good one	1.0
	This ones going to make you think	1.0
	was like there are a hundredSSin our club 10 like to free draw and the rest like to do a group activity 40 of those who free draw and 50 of those who like group activities are boys	1.0
	How many boys are in art club	8.0
	There are multiple parts to this one	1.0
	Guys dont worry about the problem and if its true or not just do the math	1.0
	You dont need comments	1.0
	Work together	1.0
	If youre not sure join up with another group	1.0
	Are you guys working together here	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So you got this	1.0
	How many like to free draw	8.0
They are 25	How many like to do group activities	7.0
We dont know how	Okay	1.0
	Write that down	2.0
	Do you see how he got that one Julian	3.0
No he	Okay	1.0
	So now you have this number and this number	1.0
	What are you going to do with those	8.0
	Forty percent of those who free draw are boys	1.0
	Do you know	2.0
	Well 40 of these like to free draw and 50 of these like to free draw are boys  figure it out	1.0
	Tomas what are you doing	2.0
Helping John	The answer is not a hundred	1.0
I didnt say it was a hundred but we already have that one	How is it going to be 200  in our club of boys when theres  in our club	8.0
Because 50 is	Did you read the whole problem	2.0
	No	2.0
	How many kids like group activities	8.0
	like group activities	1.0
	You have to break this problem down first	1.0
	Yes whatever	1.0
	There are two groups of kids in our club Kids who  and the ones who Right	1.0
	So you have to figure out how many of  first	1.0
	So you have an  and then art club is made up of art kids who like to do different things	1.0
	You have to figure out how many of those 100  and how many of those 100 like free drawing	1.0
	So you said	1.0
	What I did is I wrote you know that  and how many like free drawing	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now 50 of these were boys and 40 of these are boys	1.0
	You have this one  theyre both boys and how many boys are there	8.0
Im smarter than an eighthgrader	Whats this number	7.0
Ninety	Okay	1.0
	So this  so how many like free drawing	8.0
	how many then like to free draw	8.0
	Thats 40  I dont know	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets talk about this problem	1.0
	I did have a couple of groups who got this all on their own I think	1.0
	So voices are off	1.0
	It looks like there are 110SSin art club 10 like to free draw and the rest like to do group activities	1.0
	You have an art club full of kids and the kids like to do two different things	1.0
	What are the two different things	8.0
Free draw	Free draw	4.0
And group activities	This is kind of based on when I did our club last year	1.0
	There were	1.0
	There were a group of kids who just wanted to draw every single time but most of the kids wanted to do the group activity	1.0
	Now we have these two groups	1.0
	Theres 100SStotal	1.0
	The free draws plus the group has to equal 100 students10 of the kids in art club like to free draw	1.0
	How many kids is that	8.0
Ten	Ten	4.0
	Ten percent of 100 is 10	1.0
	If we know 10 kids like to free draw how many like group activities	8.0
Ninety	Ninety	4.0
	So there we go	1.0
	Weve got that	1.0
	Now what do we do	8.0
	Jane	2.0
You have to  find out the percentage of	Okay	1.0
	So 40 of those who free draw are boys	1.0
	So you have to find 40 of 10	1.0
	So X10  40100	1.0
	This one is four	1.0
	Im just kind of doing the shortcut	1.0
	What percentage of the people who like group activities are boys	8.0
Ninety or 50 I mean	Fifty percent of those who like group so this one is X90 part over whole equals 50100	5.0
	This one is that X45	1.0
	So 45 boys like art in the group activity four boys like to free draw	1.0
	How many boys are there in our club	8.0
Fortynine	Fortynine	4.0
	You add those two together	1.0
	These four boys who like to free draw plus these 45 boys who like group activities is 49 boys total	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Go ahead and clean up	1.0
	You can recycle the papers if you want	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Today learning targets is to be able to review our fraction test and learn from the fraction test some things that we need to get better at	1.0
	So on this math paper were going to keep this math paper over several the page that you had the blank piece of paper	1.0
	Put your name on that because were going to keep this over several keep that off the desk	1.0
	I dont like stickers on the desk	1.0
	Were going to keep this over several Wednesdays that were doing this	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So today were just going to do one and two	1.0
	Put one and two on your math paper and heres number one	1.0
One of two	Were going to do two problems	1.0
	Number one	1.0
My one is huge	You dont have to write the problem	1.0
	I just want the answers	1.0
	One and two	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Number one you do not have to write the problem	1.0
	Youre writing the answer	1.0
	I dont know whats happening at team five	1.0
	We had a rough time during silent reading	1.0
	We need to pull it together and get ready to pay attention right now	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	The problem is there are 15 bags of MMs that will go in 27 tubs of trail mix	1.0
	How many bags will go in each trail mix	1.0
Theres 27	Theres 15 bags of MMs	1.0
I know	and 27 tubs	1.0
	Remember this is our fraction unit so that should give you a clue that your answer is going to be in a fraction	1.0
	We went over this one last week how to do this kind of problem last week	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Are we ready for number two	2.0
No	We should just be writing the fraction	1.0
	Fifteen MMs and 27 tubs of trail mix	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Number two	1.0
	Write a number story for 3   7  37	1.0
Write a number story with the problem 3   7  37	Write a number story for 3   7  37	1.0
	When I pass your paper leave it flipped upside down until I come and turn it over	1.0
	Write a The first one	2.0
Yes	Theres 15 bags of MMs and 27 tubs of trail mix	1.0
	I said leave it flipped over until I tell you and turn that back over	1.0
	Leave it flipped over	1.0
	Its 3   7  37	1.0
	No	1.0
	Leave it just like this	1.0
	Write a number story for 3   7  37	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Hunter will you go pick up these papers	1.0
	Make sure your names on them	1.0
Wheres the	Its over there	1.0
	in the corner anyway	1.0
	I know	1.0
	I think you round	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If your white paper is  you may turn your tests over	1.0
Okay	If your white paper	1.0
Are we doing the next page	All right	1.0
	Eagle high five	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were going to look on our math test at three and four	1.0
	We looked at one and two	1.0
	We are now looking at number three and four today	1.0
	We may get onto the next page	1.0
	I did grade the second page if you want to look at that	1.0
	I have not graded the last page yet	1.0
	We went over one and two last time and then I had you practice to see if you remember how to do problems like one and two today	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I cant hear what youre saying	1.0
Of all the color she had to  I hate red	Okay	1.0
	Eagle high five	1.0
	Do I have everyones white papers	1.0
	Five and three two one	1.0
	Ive asked for eagle high five three times now	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Were going to look at number three	1.0
	Autumn is making and I want you to take notes on your paper	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	This is your note catcher	1.0
	If you didnt take this test on assessment day I gave you a blank one so your job is to be taking notes	1.0
	This is not for a grade	1.0
	This is to help us make sure that we understand these	1.0
But it wasnt just a pretest	We did a pretest at the beginning of the year	1.0
	We did a midtest	1.0
	We still havent learned all the concepts here on the fractions	1.0
So this is a midtest	So its a midtest to see	1.0
This is really tricky in the middle of four	Okay	1.0
	Then we will take one at the end and that one will be for a grade	1.0
	Robert	2.0
So we took this before	will you raise your hand	2.0
We took this before winter break	We took it on assessment day when we came back	1.0
	Remember when Ms Holly was in here	1.0
Yes	This was one of your assessments that you did	1.0
	But on Wednesday since its our review day then were spending some time doing this	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Number three Autumn is making two different salads	1.0
	One calls for three and threefourths cups chopped spinach	1.0
	The other calls for two and twothirds cups chopped spinach	1.0
	How much spinach does Autumn need	8.0
	We need a number model and we need a answer	1.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner about which operation are you going to do	8.0
	Are you going to do subtraction addition division or multiplication and what words are possibly giving you the hint	8.0
Because it says like in all how much addition	Okay	1.0
	Team one	1.0
	Which one	8.0
	Are we doing addition subtraction multiplication or division	8.0
Do subtraction	Okay	1.0
	Subtraction	4.0
	What do you think	8.0
	Addition	1.0
	Whats this team thinking	8.0
Addition	Addition	2.0
Addition	Addition	4.0
	Raise your hand	2.0
	What clue words made you feel like it was addition	8.0
	Frankie	2.0
How much spinach does she need	Okay	1.0
	How much	4.0
	How much lets see if thats in here	1.0
	It isnt on our clue words but when youre trying to figure out how many	1.0
	Many is up there	1.0
	Now all together No	1.0
	Its not up there	1.0
	Robert	2.0
So if I know that how many its subtraction then I know how much is probably addition	Okay	1.0
	If we were to write a number sentence Sophie what if were trying to figure out how much what would we be adding	8.0
Three and threefourths	Three and threefourths and two and twothirds equals F Thats our number sentence	5.0
	Delilah did that	1.0
	If you dont have that on yours underneath it write it	1.0
I do	Now if we wanted to add these talk to your team on a strategy to figure out how to add these two together	8.0
	Talk with your team	2.0
	Figure out how youre going to add these two together	1.0
You dont  but you dont the denominator	Whats your strategy	8.0
So I had fivetenths of it	Whats your strategy	8.0
	What s your strategy here	8.0
	What is your strategy	8.0
That s why she got it wrong	Okay	1.0
	Eagle high five	1.0
	One thing I heard is converting the fractions	1.0
	We havent really done that	1.0
	You may have done it last year	1.0
	You may know how to do that	1.0
	We havent done that but I did hear some people say add the whole numbers first and they got five	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then add the fractions with possibly fraction circles	1.0
	If I were to do fraction circles heres my 34 and heres my 23	1.0
	Now remember when we use fraction circles we put another fraction circle on top of it	1.0
	That kind of gets us to our conversion	1.0
	Once I teach you how to do conversion and like I said I know some of you already understand how to convert fractions and find equivalent fractions but if youre not quite there then this works	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So here if I were to divide this can I put on top of my fraction circle can I put three or fours on top of can I put the thirds on top of the fours	2.0
Thats what I did	Okay	1.0
	Its not going to be equal though	1.0
Unless	The reason I know why is does three divide into four equally	2.0
	No	1.0
No	Okay	1.0
	So we can go into something smaller	1.0
	What about six	8.0
	Does four go into six equally	2.0
No	Does three go into six equally	2.0
Yes	Yes so it works for this one but not this one	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	What about 10	8.0
No	No	2.0
	For neither right	2.0
Okay	What about 12s	8.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	If I had 12 pieces how many are going to fit in one four	8.0
	How many pieces of a 12	8.0
Six	Its three	1.0
	Remember theyre the pink ones	1.0
Three of 12 would fit	Now I have one two three four five six seven eight nine	1.0
	This 34 is equivalent to 912	1.0
Yes because you did 34 x 3 then that equals 912	We are going to do that in the next fraction unit	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now how many 12s are going to fit in this piece	8.0
	A third is bigger than fourth so it has to be more than three	1.0
	Piper	2.0
Four	Four	4.0
	Now if you were doing this you could actually get the fraction circles to help you because then youll know for sure	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So now I have one two three four five six seven eight	1.0
	This is 812	1.0
	So 23 equals 812	1.0
	Lydia asked me she said Isnt 34 and 23 equivalent	1.0
	Theyre pretty close arent they	2.0
	Theyre pretty close but 34 is a little bit bigger	1.0
	Its 112 bigger than two thirds	1.0
A little bit	Okay	1.0
	A little bit	4.0
	Okay now that I have fractions that are the same have the same denominator I can now add them	1.0
	My denominator is going to be what	8.0
Twelve	Twelve because we never add the denominator	5.0
	We have to have a common denominator to add the numerator	1.0
	So 8  9 is	8.0
Seventeen	Seventeen	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	12s tells me what	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	How did we get this one inside 12	8.0
	What did we do here	8.0
	Madelien do you know what we did here	8.0
	From here to here	8.0
Then it would also be a whole because you had to take for 12 and 12 is whole	Okay	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Now she did it a different way than I would but her way works	1.0
	What does this line mean Lydia	8.0
Is it dividing	Its division	5.0
	So 12 into 17 if I divide this Im going to end up exactly with what Madelien said 12 goes into 17 how many times	8.0
One	One	4.0
	Theres my whole	1.0
	Then I need to subtract 12 from the 17	1.0
Five	Thats my numerator and heres my denominator or you bring it over either way	1.0
	Yes I have 1 and 512 is that how much spinach	2.0
No	No because what am I missing	8.0
	I have this  what else am I missing	8.0
I know	Allan get a wipe	1.0
I will	Take care of that	1.0
That is	Okay	1.0
	Were giving Leonardo some think time	1.0
The numbers	Leonardo you need some help	2.0
I dont think	Okay	1.0
	Well this isnt really a fraction but what we have to do if were not understanding fractions lets make sure that were fully paying attention so we do understand it because Were doing a math problem honey	1.0
	Is this Spanish	1.0
	What do you think were doing	1.0
	Think ask somebody to help you	3.0
You leave the five and then you do five plus the one equals six and then you just bring over 512	Okay	1.0
	Heres lots of information to put on your note sheet	1.0
	You write down whats going to help you	1.0
	Casey I better see something on your paper because you didnt even take this test because you were in Mr Cs class	1.0
	There better be some notes on your paper	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Julia did you get number four right	2.0
Second part	Okay	1.0
	Were doing number four Anybody else get number four right	2.0
I got it right	Okay	1.0
	If you got number four right	1.0
	Then you can get a computer and go start the decimal stuff in Khan Academy	1.0
	Okay	1.0
for my number four problem	I dont know	1.0
	Do you feel like you need to hear	1.0
No probably not	Okay	1.0
	Well maybe you can listen while youre when we get to they why part	1.0
	Does everybody have this	1.0
	Casey	1.0
	Do you have what you want from here	1.0
Ive got a bit of a problem	What	1.0
Theres none	Theres none available	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	In either cart	1.0
	I dont know where cart nine is	1.0
	Maybe peak in the classrooms and see if theres an extra if theres any extras because usually we dont need all 30	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So are we good here	2.0
I should keep this on my desk	Yes for right now	1.0
	They said theres no computer	1.0
	Theyre looking to see if theres any extras somewhere	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ash did you take notes	1.0
Yes	You what	1.0
	Okay were doing more together	1.0
	Do you have number three	2.0
I got number three done	Okay	1.0
	Casey you do too	2.0
Yes	I can erase it or not yet	1.0
	What	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	While Caseys finish writing did you get what you wanted	1.0
	You didnt even write the right answer	1.0
	Youre saying youre having a hard time with fractions and Im giving you the answer and this is your note catcher	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	While I have some people writing what is on the board lets talk about number four	1.0
	Dempsey was solving the problem 1320  25	1.0
	He got the answer 1115	1.0
	Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong without calculating the exact answer	8.0
Yes can I say mine	Okay	1.0
	Heres what I want you to do	1.0
	I want you to come up with an explanation with your Lets do a triad three people from your team	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then the four of you do it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So maybe these three and these three	1.0
	Come up with an explanation of why	9.0
	You guys have four you can do four or one person could come over here and then theyd have three and three	1.0
	Sam what are you doing	1.0
	Well what is it	1.0
	The what	1.0
It was by the elevator	Is that cart 9	1.0
It is	Okay	1.0
	Bring it in Devin put it in front of the swivel	1.0
He subtracted it but he subtracted the denominator	Youre working over here	2.0
	You can work withEverete and Declan	1.0
What I wrote I didnt	When we talk about it	1.0
	Well see	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	In two minutes Im going to hear your explanation	1.0
	Who are you working with	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So you make sure  so he can understand whats wrong with it	3.0
He added and subtracted the denominator	done with this up here	1.0
Yes  is mine wrong	Thats not wrong	5.0
	You need more	1.0
	Are you guys done with the board	2.0
Im a Barbie girl in a Barbie world	Is everybody at this table done with whats on the board	2.0
	Is everybody at this table done with whats on the board	2.0
Im a Barbie boy in a Barbie	Everybody here are you done with whats on the board	2.0
	Casey are you done	2.0
No	Yes	1.0
	So were going to talk about some more information	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Times up	1.0
	Timer just went off	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets start with team three	2.0
	I want everyone listening	1.0
	Team three	2.0
So his answer is wrong	Okay	1.0
	Im going to ask for more and were going to put more than just that	1.0
	You have something to add	3.0
Technically when it says he got the answer 1115 he added 20 and 5 or he subtracted 20 minus 5 which got him 15 and youre not supposed to subtract the denominator	Thats what Robert said	1.0
	I want more	1.0
	Okay whats your explanation	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Listening	1.0
	Do you need your pencil sharpened	1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Whats your answer	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	So it sounds like were understanding that we dont subtract the denominator	1.0
	What did the two groups over here say	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	You dont have an answer	2.0
	Ladies	2.0
	We are listening	1.0
15 minus 12 is going to give you  you have to	Okay	1.0
	So you kind of have the same thing	1.0
	Hey this group here what did you guys say	8.0
We didnt quite have an answer yet were trying to figure it out	What about this	7.0
	Hey West	2.0
	Dont start talking	1.0
1540	1540	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	The question is explain how you know his answer is wrong without calculating it	8.0
	Did you come up with that part	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Hey what about this table	8.0
You only subtract the numerator and we only do that if you have the same denominator	Okay	1.0
	So kind of the same	1.0
I said I know he is wrong because hes  which makes no sense because you have to get the denominator the same at all times	Okay	1.0
	Every single group talked about the denominator	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to explain something that really doesnt even have to do necessarily with the denominator that is a better answer than just saying that you dont subtract denominators	1.0
	Thats 100 true	1.0
	You dont ever subtract denominators	1.0
	If theyre like if theyre different you do not subtract denominator	1.0
	You dont add them either	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	That piece Im not disagreeing but heres why what makes it a better answer using your math sense	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So I have 1320 and I have 25 equals 1115	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	This I just want to tell you that this right here is a little bigger than a half 1320 is a little bigger than a half	1.0
	25 is a little less than a half so Im almost at 0	1.0
	Because I didnt have the numbers here	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	So because this is bigger than a half a little bit this is a little less than a half my answer is going to be close to 0 if I subtracted a half	1.0
	1115 is what	8.0
	Is it equal to a half	2.0
	Is it bigger than a half	2.0
	Is it less than a half	2.0
Bigger than a half	Okay	1.0
	1115 is bigger than a half	5.0
So its nowhere near the answer	Its nowhere near zero	5.0
	I didnt say one thing about my denominators	1.0
But definitely wrong too	I know that this is wrong because of taking this number 1320 subtracting 25 my answer should be close to 0 my answer should be a little bigger than 0	5.0
But not as big as a half	But less than 12	5.0
	Okay	2.0
	Because everybody talked about denominators heres what I want you to write and I want everyone writing because  you can go over here back now with your paper	1.0
	You dont have one of these	1.0
	Get a piece of paper	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then Im going to write 1320 is a little bigger than 12 and 25 is a little less than 12	1.0
	So if I subtracted them	1.0
	Robert and Piper I also want you to write this on your paper so you have it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I know you can do the computer	1.0
Do you want us to do it on the back	I want you to do it someplace near number four	1.0
back and like four	Okay	1.0
	If you subtracted the two fractions the difference See how Im using math language	2.0
	The difference would be greater	1.0
Ms Carroll  not on the board for number four	than 0 but less than 12	1.0
	I want you writing this note Karen	1.0
	This is the answer that I was more looking for than just understanding that we dont add or subtract	1.0
	This is the next level of answer	1.0
	So with the denominator talking about the denominators if I were to give this I would give it a 25 where this would be more of a 35 answer	1.0
But technically most answers are correct	Theyre correct but this is really what were looking for not that you understand you dont have to add or subtract denominators	1.0
	I want you to understand more about what these fractions represent	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So I guess what Im saying is knowing that we dont add or subtract denominators is maybe a fourthgrade answer	1.0
	This is more a fifthgrade answer	1.0
	Im trying to get you guys to the fifthgrade plus answers	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Next Wednesday we will actually do possibly I may give you another one two three and four problem on your white paper that you did today	1.0
	We may practice all four and then well review two more	1.0
	Well review the other half of number four and number five	1.0
	When are you going to go over part B of four	1.0
	Next Wednesday just because of	1.0
Because I already corrected it because	Okay	1.0
	Just because of time	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I want everybody writing this	1.0
	Im not going to erase it	1.0
	Any other questions on what we did today	2.0
	Next time youll get the white paper youll see if you did one and two correctly	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	This is just to help us get better	1.0
	Ethan are you done with the computer	1.0
He went to the bathroom	as soon as you get back  the division problem	1.0
	Multiplication then subtraction so this is 12x2 24	1.0
	3124 youve got to do order of operation	1.0
	Friends youre down to three and a half minutes	1.0
	Wheres Frankie	8.0
	We dont have an answer  because I havent taught the lesson yet	1.0
	I have eight people left	1.0
I am too	Youre doing yours	2.0
	Alexander	2.0
What	Did you get it right	2.0
Yes so am I	You have two and a half minutes	1.0
	If you have 1 bill exchange it for	1.0
	If you have 1 bill youve got that	1.0
	Camila	1.0
Yes	I have math homework without a name	1.0
	Ethan	1.0
Yes	Can I give you 1	1.0
	Did you do your homework	1.0
Yes I did my homework	Isabel	1.0
Not me	Then I have one without a name	1.0
	Thirty seconds	1.0
	Ethan do you have 1 bills	1.0
Yes	All right	1.0
	The timer is up	1.0
	Frankie	1.0
	Go ahead and have a seat	1.0
	Five four three two one zero	1.0
	You got one minute Scarlette of your recess	1.0
Doesnt matter I think	It matters to me	1.0
	Im ready to start	1.0
	Im going to do math	1.0
	Math is going to be a little different today	1.0
	Were going to try something a little different	1.0
	First I want to look at the learning targets so you know what were doing	1.0
	Theres going to be a few different parts of math today	1.0
	Were going to be going through some different things	1.0
	Were not going to come up in groups today	1.0
	Were going to do whole group but were going to be moving through some different things	1.0
	Today the learning target is I can practice strategies for finding common denominators and use common denominators to add and subtract fractions	1.0
	Day one we learned how to find common denominators	1.0
	Were going to use that strategy and possibly some other strategies to help us now add and subtract the fraction	1.0
	I know that I can understand this when I can make any list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until I found equivalent fractions with the common denominator see if one denominator is a multiple of others	1.0
	Were going to play a game that has to do with multiples	1.0
	If so its also a common denominator or multiply the two original denominators and use their product as a common denominator	1.0
	Right here when it says practice strategies these are the three strategies that were going to use	1.0
	One you already did when you multiplied by a two by a three by a four	1.0
	You did both of those	1.0
	Thats one of the strategies here	1.0
	Im going to show you two others today	1.0
	The first thing that I want us to do is look at this short little video	1.0
Short by being an hour long	Right	1.0
	Scarlette and I decided to order a giant sandwich for lunch and split it	1.0
	Scarlette said we have to cut it in half	1.0
	I reminded him that we can cut it in as many pieces as we want	1.0
	As long as we create an equivalent fraction to one half well still get an equal share	1.0
	Lets take him through it step by step	1.0
	The first step is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number	1.0
	This is what we did yesterday	1.0
	Those of you that have turned it in everybody got a three	1.0
	That tells me that you understood how to do this strategy	1.0
is mine in there	I dont know is it	1.0
	Ill have to look	1.0
	Step two	1.0
	I told Scarlette it doesnt matter what number you use as long as you multiply the top and bottom with the same number	1.0
	Were starting with our fraction 12 because that means well each get an equal share of the sub	1.0
	Lets choose the number three and multiply it by the top and the bottom	1.0
	Now all we have to do is multiply to find the product	1.0
	When you multiply 12 by 33 you get 36 12 and 36 are equivalent fractions	1.0
	That means if we cut the sandwich in  pieces we would get three pieces each wed still be getting the samepair as if we had cut the sandwich in half	1.0
	This was just a quick little thing the next thing that were going to do were not going to talk in between because we have a lot that I want to accomplish today and the talking in between is not going to be helpful	1.0
	The next thing that youre going to do with your table and I cant remember if weve played this game before but its called buzz games so you say buzz bizz or bizz buzz	1.0
	Heres what you do youre going to stand in a circle and youre going to choose a leader	1.0
	Henry put that away	1.0
	The leader can change each time you play and what youre going to do is youre going to pick any number between three and nine as the leader and the number if I picked three then thats the buzz number	1.0
	The leader also chooses the stop number if I picked 3 and my stop number was 30 then we know how long were going	1.0
	You cannot pick a number past 100 for your stop number 100s the biggest that you can go	1.0
	Then the player to the left of the leader begins the game by saying one play continues clockwise each player saying either the next whole number or buzz	1.0
	The buzz number is three so it goes one two buzz	1.0
	Four five buzz then it keeps going	1.0
	You will say buzz every time thats its a multiple	1.0
	Then if you decide to do biz buzz if you want to challenge it then the leader names two numbers	1.0
	This first round just play buzz maybe do two to three rounds just playing buzz	1.0
	Then if you feel confident where you can add two numbers then you can play bizz buzz	1.0
	The difference with biz buzz is with bizz buzz you have the buzz numbers six and the bizz numbers three here it goes	1.0
	One two buzz if three is the bizz number	1.0
	Four five bizz buzz because three and six are multiple so itd be biz buzz	1.0
	Seven eight	2.0
	Bizz because its only a multiple of three	1.0
Oh I get it	Im going to show you guys	1.0
	You guys stand up with me	1.0
	Im going to show you guys buzz	1.0
	This team come up here	1.0
	Camila I need you paying attention stand up here	1.0
	Im going to do an easy one	1.0
	Scoot over were making a circle	1.0
	Im going to do an easy one Im going to do 5 and were going to stop at 40 and its just buzz	1.0
	You start	2.0
Buzz	No its five so you say three	1.0
Buzz	Whats after five	8.0
Six	Six seven	1.0
Eight	Its nine	1.0
Ten	Yours is buzz	1.0
No buzz	Lets stop a minute	1.0
	The reason that Logan said buzz is because the numbers five so he says buzz	1.0
	Any multiple of 5 so 5x2 10 thats a buzz and whats going to be the next buzz word	8.0
	15 then	8.0
		1.0
20 25 30 35 40	Were stopping at 40 lets see how fast we can go	1.0
No or yes	No youre 16 because she said buzz for 15	1.0
	Buzz	4.0
	Buzz	4.0
30 buzz	We stop there because thats 40	1.0
	Camila come up here	1.0
	This computer is going to be like Whoa this girl cant stop talking come sit in my chair	1.0
	Does everybody understand buzz	2.0
Yes	Now were going to do bizz buzz this is an element of challenge	1.0
	Im going to choose numbers	1.0
	Three is buzz and five is bizz and our stopping number this time is	8.0
		1.0
Your stopping number would be five or something		1.0
	No it has to be at least 10	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
Buzz	Buzz bizz	1.0
This is harder	Its a buzz because 3 goes into 12 right	2.0
Bizz 15	What should 15 be friends	8.0
Oh	Bizz	2.0
Buzz	Buzz because 3 and 5 go into 15 so bizz buzz	5.0
	16  buzz	1.0
	Jackson do I need to move you	1.0
	You should be turning around watching	1.0
	Jackson come over here I want you paying attention	1.0
	What are we on	2.0
		1.0
	Do I need to move anybody else	1.0
Its bizz	Oh no its buzz	1.0
	No hes 24	1.0
Oh	Put that away	1.0
Hes busy	Put it away	1.0
	24 is what friends	8.0
Bizz	No its buzz because three goes into it	1.0
	25 would be	8.0
Bizz	Bizz	4.0
	What can go into 27	8.0
	Three so shes buzz	1.0
Shes bizz and shes	Buzz and shes bizz	5.0
	What was your number	2.0
	27 28	1.0
	Whats 30	8.0
Its buzz	Jared whats 30	8.0
Buzz buzz	Bizz buzz	5.0
Both of those	Both of those go in	5.0
I said bizz buzz	Were going to stop at 30 even though I said 60	1.0
	I want you to stand up and play	1.0
	Stand up	1.0
Are we playing with our teams	Yes play with your time	1.0
	Whos the leader	1.0
I will	Whats the buzz number	8.0
	Just pick three or nine	1.0
Nine	Okay	1.0
Were going to end at 81	Were not on that	1.0
	End at 81	4.0
	Start	1.0
Whoever gets it wrong has to sit down	Well say  three	1.0
I dont want your dirty bike	Seven	1.0
Eight	Whos the leader	1.0
Aiden	Whats your number	2.0
Five	Okay	1.0
Its like whenever you	Whos the leader	1.0
	Whats your number	2.0
What happens if you get it wrong though	Its buzz	1.0
	Nine	1.0
	Buzz	1.0
Wait you did it by five	Five	1.0
Were not adding extra rules	No youre right	1.0
		1.0
	Buzz	1.0
To 60	Go ahead and have a seat	1.0
We all lost	at your table	1.0
	Eagle highfive	1.0
	Once eagle highfives twice	1.0
	Last time eagle highfive	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I should have everybodys attention	1.0
	Yes Sofia	2.0
	Shes the T	1.0
	The thing that I want to ask you is how did you figure out the multiples	8.0
	When you played the buzz game how did you figure out the multiples	8.0
	Ethan	2.0
It waseasy because all youve got to do is count by five	Every fifth one was a multiple	5.0
	Jared howd you do it	8.0
We all just got confused	Scarlette	2.0
We did to 100 and it was pretty	Sofia	2.0
You were like this and you were talking	They did an elimination	1.0
	If you didnt say the right number or you didnt say buzz at the right place then you were eliminated	1.0
	The next thing that you are Ill wait	1.0
	Ill wait	1.0
	The next thing youre going to do is youre going to get a card	1.0
	It could be a group of two it could be a group of three it could be a group up to five	1.0
	You are going to find people that have the same equivalent fraction that you do	1.0
	Youre not going to look at this side	1.0
	This side is not going to help you	1.0
	Youre going to look at the fraction side and youre going to find people that have the same number you do	1.0
	Just wait until I give everybody their cards	1.0
What if you dont have an equivalent fraction like zero zero	Everybody has at least one equivalent fraction	1.0
	No thats not an option	1.0
	Everybody has at least one match	1.0
	Stand up find your partners	1.0
	Sit down with your group	1.0
	Five four You should be sitting with your group	1.0
	Three two If you dont think you have a group stand over here	1.0
	Two one zero	1.0
	These people that dont think they have a group lets check to see if they go with anybody	1.0
	Pay attention	1.0
	Stop bending the cards	1.0
	68	1.0
	Does anybody think that their fraction is equivalent to 68	8.0
Its 23	23	2.0
	That would be six	1.0
	No three doesnt go into eight	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
16	68 lets see	1.0
	Does anybody have 116	8.0
What	Does anybody have 14	8.0
	Does anybody have 34	8.0
I know somebody asked for34	Okay you two are partners	1.0
	You two are partners go sit over there	1.0
	This one lets look at this one	1.0
	1012	1.0
	If youre talking please stop	1.0
We have 410	Okay 1012	1.0
Ms Carroll we have 410	Its 410 and 1012 equivalent	2.0
	Lets see	1.0
	16	1.0
	Some of you has 16	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	We may have 56	1.0
I do	You too	2.0
	What do we have here 69	2.0
23	212	1.0
Is there 16	Jackson has 12	1.0
We have 210	What	2.0
	Listen	1.0
	Listen friends	1.0
	Violet just said 24 wouldnt Jackson go with the 24 group	2.0
Yes	This whole group should be one	1.0
This whole group right here	You two Jackson and Sofia and Hannah	1.0
	810	1.0
	Who should Frankie be	2.0
	810	1.0
	Here you go eagle high five	1.0
	With your fraction cards there is a visual that shows you	1.0
	You can match it up and see if it matches	1.0
	Thats one way	1.0
	You can do the strategy that you learned on Tuesday where you multiply the smaller one by the same thing with the numerator and the denominator and see if it matches	1.0
	Violet	2.0
There is a really easy way you can get some of these card and you can go to a number line	Theres also a number line that you can look and see on the number line if its marked on the same place on the number line	5.0
	Theres three different ways just in checking in the cards to see if you have the same fraction	1.0
	With your group check and see we match some people up but couldnt find their partners	1.0
	Check and see if that worked	1.0
	Check the number lines check the visual do the multiplication trick and see	1.0
	Scarlette are you and Frankie together	1.0
Yes	Whats your numbers	8.0
25	25 so its a	5.0
	Whos 410	8.0
Theyre 410	Whos 410	8.0
	You should be with 25	1.0
	Go check it	1.0
No	When youre done checking come bring me your card and go sit back down	1.0
Can we go back with our 110	Yes go sit back down	1.0
	Eagle high fiveHenry bring me that card and  rolling it up	1.0
	Eagle high five	1.0
	In todays math message youre going to need your SRB page 72 and 73	1.0
	The math message says Thank you for staying quiet I so appreciate that	1.0
	Im finding the right page	1.0
	Work with a partner	1.0
	One partner reads about multiples in theSreference book on page 72 and lists the first 6 multiples of 8	1.0
	The other partner reads about factors on page 73 and lists all the factors of 36	1.0
	Then youre going to share with your partner what you learned in your list of numbers	1.0
	Partner with somebody at your team	1.0
	Is there anybody that doesnt have	1.0
	Then take A and B	1.0
	Here there should be three As	1.0
	Are you guys partners	1.0
Yes	Then you cant both be A	1.0
Do you want to be A	Listen up	1.0
I want A	Listen up put your hands down	1.0
	Were getting confused	1.0
	Stella come here	1.0
	Stella and I have decided to be partners	1.0
	Do you want to be A or B	1.0
A	Shes A Im B Scarlette were the same partners so shes A and Im B were not both A	1.0
	Youre going to read page 72 and list the multiples of 8	1.0
	Im going to read page 73 and list the multiple or the factors of 36 Im going to write that up here	1.0
	Thats what youre going to read	1.0
	Youre going to read and youre going to find out	1.0
	A is page 72 the first 6 multiples stop talking of 8	1.0
	Partner B is reading page 73 stop talking factors of 36	1.0
	The reason I didnt pick a number is I want you to find all the factors of 36 theres only a short number	1.0
	When you find the multiples of 8 it could go on and on so thats why Im telling you to find 6	1.0
	Everybody should have an SRB open either to page 72 or 73	1.0
	You should be reading and nobody should be talking for probably at least three minutes to four minutes while youre doing you work then youll share	1.0
	Everybody has a partner right	2.0
No	It should be quiet while were reading	1.0
	It should be quite while youre reading and doing the work whos your partner	1.0
Im reading	It should be quiet while youre reading	1.0
Then I found that  the 48	Youre supposed to be 36	1.0
	Did you write it down	2.0
I didnt even get a paper	the paper	1.0
	You can write in one of your slates	1.0
I didnt even get one	You dont have a slate	1.0
I dont understand	Theres one back there	1.0
	You got a piece of paper	1.0
Do you want to be A or B	You guys should have a breakdown and you shouldnt be talking	1.0
	Right now were reading are you A or B	1.0
	Wyatt youre A so youre reading page 72	1.0
	A is part of that too	1.0
	Okay we are going to start this morning with our morning warmup and these problems might look familiar to you they are from the exit slip we did the other day and I choose these because 80 90 of the class got ones or twos on the exit slip	1.0
	Okay so if you are like I got this theres a good chance that you got a one or two so I really want you to think of the strategies that we used	1.0
	What were the strategies that we used	8.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner please what were the strategies that we did subtraction	8.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Colin what do you remember about the strategies that we learned	8.0
Yes we learned was that we split in half the shape so subtract	Okay in order to split a shape in half what did you have to do	8.0
	Think about it use my cards	1.0
	What did you have to do first to split a shape in half	8.0
	Gianna	2.0
The first thing that we have to do was find  and then we can find what the progression is	Kind of	1.0
	In order to split a shape I have to have a shape right	2.0
	What did you do to have a shape to split	8.0
	Amy	2.0
I think I wasnt the only one there was	Abel in order to have a shape you have to do something what did you have to do	8.0
Like take the denominator and split it and the	I cant split something I dont have you guys are jumping ahead quite a bit yes	5.0
You need to label it	I cant label something I dont have	5.0
You have to split both  like this is like a part here and a part here	I dont have any parts of anything  youre on the right track of what we do but were all forgetting what we did first and emphasizing this because Im sorry to interrupt Rose Im emphasizing this because on your exit slip very few people even tried to use the strategy in the class Maddie	2.0
You have to draw a picture	You have to draw a picture then we can split and do everything that Rose is telling us and Colin was telling and whoever else I called on was telling us	5.0
	First you have to draw a picture there were only about six people in the class who drew a picture on the exit slip and then there were only about one or two of those six people who drew a picture for both of them and then I could see that some people drew a picture but were confused which is why we are doing this warmup today	1.0
	What I want you to do I want you to start with the strategy of drawing a picture and I want you to just solve this first one go	1.0
	Everybody	1.0
	Why do I hear talking	1.0
	Were not working with our partner right now	1.0
	We have a picture for this	1.0
Yes I found it its right next to Monica	The reason why you have a table of contents is that you look at your table of contents and you are like Oh Im looking for the coordinate plain	1.0
	Oh there is the word	1.0
	Then you look and say its page 14	1.0
	That way you dont have to flip through every page	1.0
	Lets go over this	1.0
	Then you guys are just going to do a ton of practice today	1.0
	Read for me the paragraph under the coordinate plane	2.0
	Dante	2.0
The coordinate plane is formed by the intersection of a horizonal	Horizontal	1.0
The number line intersects at the origin and separates the coordinate plain into four regions called quadrants	The origin is where they meet and the origin is zero	1.0
	Where all the lines meet is zero	1.0
	If you dont have this I can get you one in a minute	1.0
	It is broken up between the horizontal and the vertical	1.0
	The horizontal is the Xaxis the vertical is your Yaxis	1.0
	When you graph to the right and is positive on the X to the left is negative and then with the vertical up is positive down is negative and this is the Yaxis	1.0
	This is quadrant one quadrant one is positive positive so your X number and your Y value are both going to be positive	1.0
	This one is  this one is negative	1.0
	This is quadrant three and quadrant four is	1.0
	Those are your four quadrants	1.0
	Remember that quadrant one is positive positive and then it goes counterclockwise it goes backwards around	1.0
	An ordered pair is used to locate a point on the coordinate plane	1.0
	Your order pair is written in parenthesis the X is always listed first	1.0
	You always go over before you go up	1.0
	An airplane goes down the runway before it takes off	1.0
	You have to walk into the elevator before you can go up or down	1.0
	Its always X then Y	1.0
	Think about the alphabet	1.0
	X comes before Y in the alphabet	1.0
	X Y easy right	2.0
Yes	Im going to give you a little worksheet to do	1.0
	So easy	1.0
	You can work with your table partner	1.0
	really need a lot of help	1.0
	Your first one is this way or this way	1.0
	Always go this way first	1.0
	X is first then Y you always go over before you go up or down	1.0
	Thats Where is 7	2.0
	You go over first	1.0
	Then you go 5	1.0
You really got one	You go over 6 and then you are going to go 9	1.0
4 thats a thing	Okay how would you tell me to find letter J	8.0
You do	Right	1.0
	From here then what are you going to do	8.0
	you have to go up or down	8.0
Positive	That means up or down	8.0
Up	We are going to go up to six so what letter is that	8.0
	Is positive two over this way or this way	8.0
People find 2		4.0
	That means up or down	8.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Quickly were going to go over this	1.0
	I think most of you have this correct	1.0
	Where is	8.0
	Im just going to post this	1.0
	Number one what point is at  Michael	8.0
You just said it	Oh sorry	1.0
	Number two were going down	1.0
	What is at	8.0
	Jeffrey	2.0
D	D Number three what is at  Leo	8.0
H	What is at  Tara	8.0
R	What is at  Marco	8.0
	What	1.0
	Not even close	1.0
	Q Renee whats at	8.0
S	Rebecca whats at	8.0
F	Jamie whats at	8.0
U	Nice job	1.0
	Please tell me the ordered pair to get to J	8.0
	Youre going to tell me how would I get to J Deb	8.0
	When you write it order pairs are written in parenthesis and they have a comma inbetween the two of them	1.0
	Im going to go across this thing	1.0
	Katrina how do I get to N	8.0
	P Eva	8.0
P	I Sasha	8.0
I	If I go  I end up here	5.0
	No it would be  is going to be right here	1.0
	How do I get to I	8.0
	When I go on the Xaxis I have to go negative Sasha so its 4 then 4	1.0
	How do I get to F Brock	8.0
	Royce stop talking	1.0
	Deb E	8.0
	G Royce	8.0
	Rebecca Y	8.0
	The next ones we have to put these points on the coordinate grid	1.0
	Point Z is at	1.0
	We go over 5 up 9 and then you have to put the letter Z	1.0
	K is at	1.0
	Your K should be there	1.0
	A is at	1.0
	B is at	1.0
	X is at  over 5 down 2	1.0
	M is at 6 backward 6 down 9	1.0
	C is at  and the last one is Z which is at  which is right above C Good	1.0
Yes	Yes go ahead	4.0
	Questions on this	2.0
	Jan and Greg Im really not sure whats going on over there	1.0
Is there a	Theres not a  but I took up more sheets for you	1.0
I hope so	Not yet	1.0
	Learning target isor I think already didstudents will be able to locate and graph points that contain negative numbers in a coordinate plane	1.0
	How many of you feel like you have already reached our learning target for the day	2.0
	Awesome	1.0
	Were going to practice some more though	1.0
	Were going to practice a little bit more	1.0
	On the back of this piece of paper Im going to set a timer	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Yesterday I didnt have this plugged in	1.0
	Now we have that plugged in	1.0
	All right	1.0
Hi	Here is how this is going to work	1.0
	You will have a problem and then therell be the time	1.0
	You want to make sure that you have enough time to teach everybody in the group because you dont know who is going to get called to actually have to come up here and do the problem	1.0
	The first one is 517  85	1.0
	You can talk in your teams	2.0
Youre probably better at math than me	Now and dont come to me with your answer yet because you dont know whos going to be Oh pick your first captain too	1.0
If you turn off the lights and you have the candle with you and you say	Okay	1.0
	You have two minutes to make sure everybody in your team knows how to do it	1.0

Im not good at lattice	Do you want to try if its for two points for your team	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Give it a try	1.0
	See this is why its important to take on that coaching role	1.0
	It doesnt really matter if you know how to do it because you dont know in your team whos going to get called	1.0
	I dont know either	1.0

	First I have to look at 27 does it go into 3	2.0
No	Does it go into 39	2.0
Yes	Yes one time	5.0
	1  27  27 then I subtract	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then I get 12	1.0
	Next step is to bring down	1.0
	Aria you this far I know	1.0
	Okay I dont know about anybody else	1.0

	Okay	1.0
	This is wrong	1.0
	Now you need to get 27  5 and then shut that	1.0
	27  6	1.0
	This team may have gotten a point	1.0
	This is 162 what is your remainder	8.0
I think I did the math wrong	Okay	1.0
	What team are you for	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Jay you didnt get called  All right	1.0
	146 remainder nine	1.0
	Okay next Okay heads down	1.0
	Heads down  Okay problem number three	1.0
	Okay you need to write a number story for two divided by three	1.0
	new captain two divided by three	1.0
My friend Bob	Write the number story	1.0
had	They had two sandwiches and they shared it amongst	1.0
This isnt even a fraction	Okay 40 seconds left	1.0
	Okay times up	1.0
	Times up	1.0

	Excuse me we are listening to Elena	1.0
How many pieces does each friend get	Everly	2.0
How much cookies does each friend get	How much is it	8.0
Twothirds	which teams got it right	1.0
	Listen	1.0
	Okay team one got it right	1.0
	Team three got it right	1.0
	Team four got it right	1.0
	Team five did not	1.0
	Okay lets go Emerson	2.0
	Come up here	1.0
	Okay your team got it right Emerson	1.0
	Explain to us how to solve this problem	8.0
	Turn around go ahead	2.0
Just like	Tell us what would the two represent	8.0
Hey I cant hear him because you are all talking	Is two what you split up	2.0
	Or is two the people	2.0
Two the people	Whats the three	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Im going to give it to somebody else	1.0
	Im going to give you a  point	1.0
	Thats not quite right	1.0
	For participating thank you for trying	1.0
	What team is Maddie in	1.0
	Okay Maddie come explain it	1.0
	This is worth two points	1.0
	Whats the two represent	8.0
The object	The object that youre dividing up	5.0
	Kayla	1.0
	Two represents the object	1.0
	Ari	1.0
	I mean Carson	1.0
	Two represents the object so the first number represents what youre dividing okay	2.0
	Whats the three	8.0
The people	Okay the people or if youre it on tables or whatever	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	The two in the fraction would be what	8.0
	Which part	8.0
	The numerator or the denominator	8.0
	The numerator	1.0
	Whats the three	8.0
	Carson	2.0
	Your team had a hard time with this	1.0
	I would like you to listen	1.0
	The three represents	8.0
Denominator	Denominator	4.0
	Okay so Maddie youre part of team what	1.0
Four	Four	1.0
	Okay we did not get to finish this so I want you to see whos in your team	1.0
	We will finish it tomorrow or next Wednesday	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Go ahead and go back to your seats clear off your desks and get out your social studies book	1.0
	Please for just a minute let me clarify something	1.0
	When you go to the store and somethings on sale and this happens all the time	1.0
	This is a fabulous problem because this is very real life	1.0
	I would use like Kohls as an example	1.0
	When you go to Kohls and you buy clothes there or whatever usually somethings on sale there	1.0
	I dont ever buy anything unless its on sale	1.0
	Can you please stop	1.0
	Lets say something thats 30 off of the regular price what Kohls does is when they bring it in they take the 30 off then you have a new price and then I have a coupon for 10 off	1.0
	They dont add the two discounts together and give you 40 off they take the 30 off	1.0
	If my shirt costs 10 and they take 30 off they take 3 off now my shirt costs 7 then they take the 10 off	1.0
	Think about your problem and what youve done there because a lot of you that whole 10 youve got it a little bit whaaky	1.0
	Think about what you did on there	1.0
	Group three two you have a lot of random side conversations going on	1.0
	Victor I need you to turn around	1.0
	I need to see work on paper Im going to model for you my expectation because a lot of you are like Is this right	1.0
	I look at your paper and Im like Is what right	1.0
	I dont know what youre doing you dont have anything labeled its not neat and organized	1.0
	We have two different options option A and option B	1.0
	Option A Im doing this on my paper I would write thered be an A here on this side and I know that option A is 40 off of 150 so then Im going to figure that out	1.0
	You could figure out what 40 off is or you could also figure out how much youre going to pay what percentage are you going to pay	1.0
	If youre getting a discount of 40 off the total what percentage are you paying	8.0
	60	7.0
	60 good job Louis	5.0
	You could change it and do 60 either way works and Ill model both for you	1.0
	If you said you have this 40 off the total the whole thing is 150 is what	8.0
	I would simplify at least take those zeros off drop the zeros cross multiply I have 10x equals 1504 is 600 10	1.0
	I get the x is equal to 60 what does that 60 represent Gideon	8.0
	This is how much youre taking away so you could then do 150 your total minus your discount is 90	1.0
	This one is that the snowboard costs 90 and maybe box it or something	1.0
	Daniel turn around	1.0
	You could have also then figured you could have done it the other way and said 60 of 150 because thats what youre paying this is your discount	1.0
	You could have done x over 150 equals 60 over 100 and in this one youd still have 10x equals 1506 is 900 and when you divide by 10 you get that x is equal to 90	1.0
	Weve got 90 either way you have to really think about what does this number represent this percentage is the amount off this 60 is how much you pay so either way will work	1.0
	We know that in option A we are going to pay 90	1.0
	Option B had multiple steps	1.0
	Option B is that you get 30 off first so you have to figure out what 30 of 150 is or you could do 70 of it what youre going to pay	1.0
	Lets just say most of you did this 30 of 150 then you had x over 150 equals 30 over 100 drop those zeros 10x equals 450 10 this is where you guys were all got weird	1.0
		1.0
	What do I have to do with that 45	8.0
	Because I still have to take 10 off but I have to do something with this 45 first Im not going to take 10 of 45	1.0
	Its 30 off and then plus 10 off of the sale price	1.0
	What do I need to do Seth	8.0
	You have to subtract 45 from 150	7.0
	Take your 150 and you have to subtract your 45 to get your sale price	5.0
	Now its 10 of whats my sale price	8.0
	15045	8.0
		7.0
		5.0
	10 of 105 guys you should be able to do that in your brain	1.0
	Work on that skill	1.0
	105	7.0
	105 1050 cents	5.0
	I could write this whole formula but 10 of 105 is 1050 cents	1.0
	Am I done	2.0
	No	7.0
	No	4.0
	You could do two different ways you could look at how much youre going to get off this one youre going to get 60 off this one youre going to get 45 off plus 1050 which is 5550 so this one youre going to get a bigger discount or then you could take your 1051050 which is 9450	1.0
	Which one is your snowboard cheaper	8.0
	Heres the snowboard in option A heres the snowboard in option B which ones cheaper	8.0
	A	1.0
	You could also look at your discount	1.0
	This one you figured out your discount is 60 off this one your discount is 45 off plus 1050 off which is 5550 which discount is more money off 60 or 5550	8.0
		7.0
		4.0
	Theres multiple ways to think about this	1.0
	Yours should be fairly neat	1.0
	It should be labeled	1.0
	Answers should be circled then you should write 40 off is the better	8.0
	Deal	7.0
	deal	4.0
	Write this out	1.0
	Questions on this one	2.0
	What Im going to do I believe that is all of the slides on here Im going to give you guys a pillow packet	1.0
	Were not going to do the Spring break because its  were going to do some practice	1.0
	What were going to do is Im going to give you a packet	1.0
	I have highlighted the problems that I want you to work on	1.0
	Work on them with a partner or partners and only one packet per two three people and we will work on those together	1.0
	Get as much of it done as you can	1.0
	Now if you get like two problems done weve got a problem	1.0
	I think I highlighted like 12 or 13 of them	1.0
	You dont have to get them all done	1.0
	Some of them are pretty tricky	1.0
	Think about what its asking	1.0
	Please do not write on these because I need to use them with second lot	1.0
	You are working now and if you want to work with me in our little table	1.0
	Guys if youre getting numbers thats like 0693 Nina right and its money what would you do	8.0
	Just round it up	7.0
	You would round it up to the nearest cent	5.0
	Round it up to the nearest cent	1.0
	Your hot dog cost a dollar six	1.0
	Now the problem is a lot of you are not thinking of your 99 as 99 cents	1.0
	Your 99 in there is 099 it is not the 99	1.0
	No that is not 99	1.0
	Think about your numbers you got	1.0
	Hey everyone please one second please	1.0
	I want you to teach you a little shortcut to finding tax	1.0
	If you want to find tax of something for like number whats that	8.0
	Number five where youre  restaurant	1.0
	Your meal start 275 and the tax is what percent	8.0
	5 tax	1.0
	Whats 5 as a decimal	8.0
	005	7.0
	Multiply your amount  005 and thats your tax	5.0
	Thats the shortcut	1.0
	Thats exactly what youre doing with the proportion but this is the other way to do that	1.0
	It really jumps into what were doing today	1.0
	Tell me what was your big understanding from math yesterday	8.0
	Lets start with James	2.0
Yesterday was understanding how to subtract and add different common denominators and fractions	Thank you for starting this would you call on someone else	2.0
Were trying to find common denominators	Im hearing like I say her big understanding from yesterday was trying to find common denominators	5.0
	Im going to challenge you Louis to share more about why	9.0
	Why do we need common denominators sometimes	9.0
	When we have common denominators then we can add and subtract fractions	1.0
	Thats what Im hearing you guys say	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Quinn would you like to add	3.0
Were trying to get common denominators to solve unlike denominators because its kind of hard to solve with unlike denominators	What do you mean its kind of hard to solve unlike denominators tell us more	8.0
Because if you have 1238 you really dont know how to add 1338 because there are two unlike denominators	We need to speak about that	1.0
	Anything you want to add	8.0
	Today were going to learn three more or three different strategies that were going to add to our toolbox today so that we have a lot of strategies everybody some of your pockets some of you dont put in your back pocket would be this is an expression	1.0
	Im going to keep something in my back pocket even if you dont have a back pocket	1.0
	Were going to have many strategies to find common denominators to help us add and subtract fractions	1.0
	All right thanks for your ideas	1.0
	Im going to have you head back to your seats please and get whiteboard marker math journal	1.0
	I love how quickly most of you have whiteboard and marker out already	1.0
	Did you scribble on	1.0
	Now were starting	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right friends	1.0
	Id like you to look at the front whiteboard and I would like to hear all of our voices for what were going to accomplish in lesson 52 today	2.0
	I want to hear all of your voices	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Im going to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions	Okay	1.0
	In your own words what is that asking	8.0
	What are we going to do today	8.0
	A minute ago we talked to our face partners	1.0
	Youre talking to your face partner again and this time partner B is speaking first	2.0
	Look at your manage map	1.0
	Raise your hand if youre partner B and what is our learning intention asking us to do today	8.0
Use fractions and multiples to add and subtract fractions to find common denominators	Please bring your conversations to a close three two one zero	1.0
	Youll find that thats how I get our attention a lot I say three two one and get to zero voices	1.0
	Emma will you tell us that what was the conversation you and your partner have	8.0
We said it will be to use factors and multiples to find common denominators for numbers that have uncommon denominators so you could add and subtract the fractions	Love it	1.0
	I heard Emma say we are having two new strategies today using factors and multiples	5.0
	Actually I think theres three new strategies today that we use factors and multiples to help us find common denominators so that we can add and subtract fractions	1.0
	I want to hear all of your voices again how will we know if we have it today	2.0
I will be successful when I can find a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	At the end of math today you will know how to use different strategies and I will be asking you to explain how the different strategies work	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Yes my dear	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	On your whiteboard just a couple of things I want to show you	1.0
	T2 would you normally have them put this in their spiral	1.0
	We give them a copy of it	1.0
	They have copies	1.0
	You have it for them	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I want you to think about those words factors and multiples	1.0
	These are our math vocab words that youve probably heard in third and fourth grade but it is important we clarify them in fifth grade so that we know exactly what were finding today in math	1.0
	If you look at the factor pair you see the box on the screen	1.0
	Factors are numbers we multiply together to get the target number	1.0
	Everybody write 36 on your whiteboard	1.0
	Now I want you to start thinking just like they did here what are the different ways you can multiply two factors to get 36	8.0
	Lets start listing them	1.0
	We can do 1	8.0
36	There you go write those two down	1.0
	We can do 2 what	8.0
18	3	8.0
12	4	8.0
9	9 and	8.0
6 6	6 6	4.0
	Those are all factors of 36	1.0
Miss I have a question	Absolutely	1.0
	Im looking at how students wrote them and they wrote them in a variety of different ways is there a specific way that they should write that or can they just write 1 3636 2 1836	1.0
	Can I hold this up	1.0
	I think that in math its important that kids do it the way that makes sense to them	1.0
	One time I heard this called the rainbow strategy	1.0
	You can make make a rainbow 1 and 36 1 36	1.0
	This student in your class listed the factor pairs with a comma in between	1.0
	This student in your class listed them this way	1.0
	Im going to tell you theres not one way but it is important that you have a strategy that works for you to list all the factors of a number	1.0
	Lily would you hold yours up too	1.0
	This is Lilys	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I dont remember which one is which which one is yours Nicki	2.0
	All right friends	1.0
	These are what we call factors	1.0
	The numbers you multiply are what	8.0
Factors	Factors	4.0
	When you multiply the number the answer is called	8.0
	Its actually called a product but we would say 20 is a multiple of 4 because 4 5 is	8.0
20	20	4.0
	We would say 20 is a multiple of 5 because 5x4 is 20	1.0
	I want you to get in the habit of using the words factor and multiple in your math conversations	1.0
	All right	1.0
	You may erase your whiteboard	1.0
	Were going to get started with todays lesson	1.0
	Some of our lesson today will be at our desks	1.0
	Some of it youll be working with partners	1.0
	Some of it were going to be doing something called Mix and Mingle	2.0
	Mix and Mingle is a strategy for us to talk about our thinking with a partner thats not of our table group	1.0
	Gets us moving gets us to start thinking gets us talking with someone that we havent been talking to	1.0
	I may give you a fun question to practice Mix and Mingle with before we do it for math	1.0
	Get your whiteboard ready	1.0
	Heres your question	1.0
	What is your favorite part of being in T2s class	1.0
	You have 30 seconds	1.0
	What is your favorite part of being in T2s class	1.0
	When youre ready please stand up	2.0
	Fletcher Im going to have you do an example with me where Im going to say mingle that means were just going to wander around and when teacher says freeze we high five	1.0
	The person with the lightercolored shirt will share first	1.0
	I would say my favorite part of being in T2s class is her morning meetings and her kindness messages	1.0
	You would respond to me like Yes I like that too or something like that and then I would hear from you	1.0
	Will you tell me yours	2.0
I like to be in her class because she always helps you with what youre doing unless she knows that you can do the problem and that youre just asking for help so that you know that youre getting it right and stuff	Im hearing you say shes really good at giving you just the right push and knowing how hard to have you work and then helping you when you need it	2.0
Yes	Awesome	1.0
	Thanks for being my partner	1.0
	We would mingle again and I would find the next person that have their hand up ready	1.0
	Youre not going to wait for me to tell you to find your next partner	1.0
	Youre going to put your hand up and find your next partner to talk with	1.0
	The other thing thats important in Mix and Mingle is that you keep your conversations focused on what is on your whiteboard and youre always polite and respectful	1.0
	If you are looking for a partner walk toward the carpet and then someone around here might be like Hey I need a partner too	1.0
	Come join me	1.0
	Please Mix and Mingle	1.0
	When I say freeze youll talk and the person that speaks first has the lighter shirt	1.0
	Go	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Freeze please	1.0
	High five the person closest to you	1.0
	If you dont have a partner right away walk toward the carpet and find someone else thats walking toward the carpet	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Then if you have something like this where theres one person that doesnt have a partner either you can find a teacher or you can join another team so that we have someone whos always sharing	1.0
	Hey lightercolored shirt go	1.0
	Remember as soon as youre done you say thank you so much and look for that next partner	1.0
	Remember if youre looking for a partner walk toward that carpet and look for someone else that needs a partner	1.0
	Three two one zero voices	1.0
	Please thank the person youre with right now and head back to your seat	1.0
	At your seat right now you are going to share something you heard from someone else in the classroom	1.0
	T2are your teams numbered like team one team two	1.0
	I have one two three four five	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Then my friends that are my outliers they know what table to go to	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	What were going to do is Im just going to call on someone but its going to be based on your table number and your seat number	1.0
	You need to know right now	1.0
	Think to yourself Okay Im table four person two or Im table one person four or five	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Please stand up if you are a three at your table group	1.0
	Stay standing if you sit at team four	1.0
	Everyone else sits and let team four Whos team four	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Would you tell me your name	2.0
Carson	Carson would you share with your classmates whats something youve heard from someone else in your Mix and Mingle	2.0
From Jon he said that his favorite part of being in T2s class is T2	Love it	1.0
	Thanks for sharing	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Stand up if you are Actually lets do three claps for Carson for sharing something she got	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Please stand up if you are teammate number four	1.0
	Stay standing if youre at team one	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Fletcher tell us	2.0
	What did you hear from a classmate	2.0
	Tell them not me	1.0
	Ive already been in fifth grade	1.0
I heard from Olivia that she always helps him be able to learn and how she always knows what to do to get him to understand math stuff	Thanks for sharing Fletcher	1.0
	Give him three claps please	1.0
	We will do one more	1.0
	Stand up if you are teammate number one	1.0
	I would like to hear from table five	1.0
	Stay standing if youre at table five	1.0
I heard from Ava that she likes being in T2s class because  science	Science love it	1.0
	Three claps	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Please erase your board	1.0
	Were going to do Mix and Mingle with a math question now	1.0
	If I can find the mouse this is what I do	1.0
	Movement	1.0
	Here we go my friends	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Do you use this	1.0
	I always use the resources but	1.0
	Then if you have something like this where theres one person that doesnt have a partner either you can find a teacher or you can join another team so that we have someone whos always sharing	1.0
	Then theres activities	1.0
	I love this	1.0
	Okay my friends weve already talked about this	1.0
	Remember you may use a strategy that works for you	1.0
	What are the factors of 36	8.0
	Go on your whiteboard	1.0
	Im seeing some several different ways and I love how Im seeing several different ways that kids are writing down their math	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	When I say three two one show youre going to show your whiteboard and I want you to look around the room at how many different ways kids are writing down factors and factor pairs for 36	1.0
	Three two one show	1.0
	Look around the room and look at the different methods different classmates used for writing the factors and factor pairs of 36	1.0
	Okay quietly put your boards down and check yourself	1.0
	Do you have 1 and 36	2.0
Yes	2 and 18	2.0
No	3 and 12	2.0
We just have 2 and 18	4 and 9	2.0
Yes	And 6	2.0
Yes	Because of 6 6	1.0
	Those are factor pairs	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Multiple	1.0
	This is a different type of question and we are going to do Mix and Mingle with this question	1.0
	What are the first six multiples of 8	8.0
	When you multiply 8 what are the first six multiples you get	8.0
	I want you to remember that a multiple is different than a factor	1.0
	A multiple is the answer when you multiply the factor	1.0
	Ill give you a hint	1.0
	Whats 8 1	8.0
8	Theres your first multiple of 8	5.0
	Whats 8 2	8.0
16	Theres your second multiple of 8	1.0
	All right were going to do a little Mix and MingleOkay	1.0
	Please stand up	1.0
	Its okay if youre not quite done but you will have a conversation with your mingle partner	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Mix	1.0
	Please freeze	1.0
	High five the person closest to you and would you please share darker shirt first	2.0
	What are the first six multiples of 8 and do you have the same thinking	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Tell me what you have Junior	2.0
	Are we looking for someone	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I love how youre finding that next partner	1.0
	Go check your answers with one more different person please	1.0
	All right and please wrap up your conversation thank your partner and head to your seats	1.0
	Three two one zero voices we should all be back in our seats and you may check your thinking on the front whiteboard	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Great idea	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Why is it impossible first of all to list all the multiples of a number	9.0
	James Oh my gosh I love how fast your brain thought of that	1.0
	Say that nice and loud	2.0
It can go on forever	What can go on forever	8.0
The multiples of 8 or 1	Multiples of 8	4.0
	If were talking about what are the first six multiples of 8	1.0
	We just asked you to write down six	1.0
	They could go on and on and on forever because numbers are infinite	1.0
	They can go on and on forever	1.0
	Why do our multiples of 8 start at 8	9.0
	Think about that for a minute	1.0
	Why do our multiples of 8 start at 8	9.0
	Anyone willing to share their thinking about that	9.0
	Quinn	2.0
Because 0 8 is always 0 and 1 8 is always whenever a number multiply one	I like that	1.0
	Emma	2.0
Youre going to get smaller than 8	Is 1 a multiple of 8	2.0
No	Say that again	2.0
1 isnt a multiple of 8 its a factor	Jon is saying 1 is a factor of 8 1 is not a multiple of 8	5.0
	I love T2s math sentence starters up there on the wall	1.0
	Jon say that one more time and I want someone to add on with one of those sentence starters up there	1.0
	Can 1 be a multiple of 8	2.0
	Speak up can you hear him	2.0
	Hey speak up a little louder	2.0
1 cant be a multiple of 8 because its a factor	1 is a factor of 8 1 is not a multiple who can respond to that	8.0
	Would you call on someone Jon	2.0
2 816 but 1 88 so it is a factor	Okay	1.0
	Lets do one more practice on our whiteboard please	1.0
	Ready	2.0
Yes	Write the number 12	1.0
	The first thing I want you to solve for are the factors of 12	1.0
	What are the factors or the factor pairs for 12	8.0
	When you say factor or factor pair think what   what	1.0
	Youre just doing the factors of 12 so what   what12	8.0
	All right friends	1.0
	You have factors right	2.0
	Factors of 12 give me two	1.0
	Yes my dear	1.0
6 and 2	6 and 2	4.0
	That works	1.0
	Yes my dear	1.0
3 and 4	3 and 4	4.0
	We know 6 212	1.0
	3 412	1.0
	Are there more	2.0
Yes	Is there another one Zachary	8.0
4 3	4 3 and 3 4	5.0
	We know those can go either way right	2.0
	Do we have anything else	8.0
1 12	1 12	4.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Thank you friends	1.0
	Now we have factors	1.0
	Now whats this other one multiple	8.0
	Would you please write the first three multiples of 12	1.0
You mean 12	No I mean well you may erase use this	1.0
	When you think about multiples of 12 were going to say 12 1 is	8.0
12	12	4.0
	Whats 12 2	8.0
How many multiples	Do the first three 12 3	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	T2 do you have the rag	1.0
	I hope so	1.0
	Were not supposed to just use that	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Factors and multiples do we need those for our strategies today	2.0
	Good job having practiced with factors and multiples	1.0
	Were going to move on to our journal now to learn those three big strategies	1.0
	You may put away your whiteboard and marker	1.0
	Take out your math journal and pencil	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Friends Do you have carpet spots	2.0
Yes	Please meet me on the carpet	1.0
With our journal	With your journal and pencil	1.0
	Can you go borrow one from Morgan Stanley or Susan	1.0
	We have to play here	1.0
	Yes go ahead	1.0
	What	2.0
	Im sure someone in here can help you with that	1.0
	Okay my friends we have three different strategies	1.0
	The page that you need to go to is yes 156	1.0
	My friends we have three strategies	1.0
	Weve talked about a couple of them for how to get common denominators	1.0
	Im actually going to go ahead and click over here on your strategy	1.0
	I need T2s remote	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were going to look at strategy one and you can ignore the 12 24 and 36	1.0
	Right here we are going to just jot down some notes on one of our strategies	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	One of the big strategies is make a list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find equivalent fractions with a common denominator	1.0
	You have space to write that	1.0
	The part I highlighted I want you to write that down right now	1.0
	This is your resource that you can go back to and use	1.0
	You mean the same thing	1.0
	The same thing that they have written down you write down that exact same thing and this is your resource for your math journal	1.0
	We provide all that	1.0
	I would	1.0
	Make a list of the equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find the equivalent fractions with a common denominator	1.0
	Thank you Emma	1.0
	Now lets practice this strategy that we just wrote down	1.0
	Hold your hand up if you need more time just to write strategy one	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Take a second to finish writing strategy one	1.0
	Its okay	1.0
	Ill give you some time in a second	1.0
	Sorry that you guys have to be my guinea pigs today as I get back into the swing of things and teaching fifth grade	1.0
	Currently T2 what Im looking for is a whiteboard screen and I know theres a way to do it I just know it	1.0
	Well I dont want to open something new and I dont want to save something	1.0
	What I want is just a whiteboard to write on	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Now	1.0
	How did you get that was it the easel looking thing	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You do this and then	1.0
	Then next to it is the Okay	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	There are tryptase markers in all different colors right over there	1.0
	Well in this one we could use the other markers too	1.0
	Theyre right here	1.0
	Whats our first strategy we have written down	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	What do you think of today	2.0
	Very good	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	We are going to make a list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find what	8.0
	An equivalent fraction	1.0
	What if we were going to add 29  56	8.0
	If you have 2956 and were going to use the equivalent fractions strategy	1.0
	My friends I am doing number one and you can do it with us	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Get your pencils ready	1.0
	How do we find equivalent fractions for 29 and 56 so that we can add and subtract	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Tim you may go up and show	1.0
	Talk to us about how would you solve this with finding equivalent fractions so that they have common denominators	1.0
I start writing two fraction lists	You show me how you want to do it	1.0
	Talk to us about what youre doing and why	1.0
Im starting 9 and then Im going up to 18 plus fraction	Im hearing Tim say hes listing the factors	1.0
	Youre listing the multiples	1.0
	Hes listing the multiples of 9	1.0
Then 6 12 18 and then	Wow did you see that Zachary	2.0
	The way he just did that	1.0
	I know that that would help a lot of kids in here	1.0
	He wrote out the multiples of 9 and Fletcher wrote the multiples of 6 and then what was your next step	8.0
I circled them to make sure that	He circled what was the multiple that they both had	1.0
	Now how is that going to help you get common denominators	8.0
	Show us	1.0
	How are you going to change those two fractions so that you can add them	8.0
You do this three times and do that two times	Tell them what do you guys think will it work	3.0
	Try it	1.0
	Now	1.0
	Talk to your classmates	2.0
	You agree fifthgraders agree disagree would you do it the same way	1.0
I dont know	Call on someone	2.0
I feel like its probably going to be a great answer	How do you know	9.0
You plus the one and plus the one and youll get your answer	Chloe	2.0
I agree because it took me two multiples of 9 to get to 18 and even it had 29 2 and then took me 3 to get to 18 multiple of 6 and then get 3 6	Tim thank you for sharing your thinking	1.0
	Lets see if we can get this to go back	1.0
	Thats okay	1.0
	We need to erase it first go back to where you were	1.0
Or you can just click the side	Click the side Tim	1.0
Then click  then click the erase	Click the erase and then yes	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Good job Quinn	1.0
	All right my friends	1.0
	Lets go try another one back on our whiteboard and then were going to come back to our journal	1.0
	Back to part two after weve reenergized our minds with snack	1.0
	Lets look at a word that we will be using today	1.0
	Alexis has taught us this word earlier this year	1.0
	The word is addend	1.0
	Everybody say that	2.0
	Read the definition with me	2.0
	Thats what an addend is	1.0
	A number which added to another	1.0
	I dont know that I like the wording of that	1.0
	Put it in your own words	1.0
	This representation might help you to put it into your own words	1.0
	Think about what that would be in your own words	1.0
	Person B shares their thinking first	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Okay back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets hear how you put this into your own words Brandon	2.0
	What do you think of his explanation Lucas	3.0
	My friends have microphones on their tables theres a button that has a white circle	1.0
	Can you please push that button so the green light comes on	1.0
	Did the green light come on	1.0
Yes	You guys got yours on	1.0
Yes	You got yours on	1.0
Yes	You got yours on	1.0
Yes	Good	1.0
	Ive also forgot  Thank you	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Hopefully that little mini lesson from your team mates will help you	1.0
	Lets read this number	2.0
	Now say it loud	2.0
0586	Excellent	1.0
	Please round this to the nearest whole number and flash	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	If you said one you are correct	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Round to the nearest tenth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	If you said six tenths you are correct	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Okay can you see that	1.0
	Sorry I tried to move it up	1.0
	Round this number now to the nearest hundredth please	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	If you said 059 you are correct	1.0
	If youre getting it incorrect ask yourself what youre doing incorrectly	1.0
	Why dont you just read the right answer and evaluate Oh this is what I need to do differently	1.0
	I know what to do	1.0
	Im still confused	1.0
	Fabulous	1.0
	This is one of the things Im going to be picking up the pace on the slate because well lose to much time with this	1.0
	Do you notice the pace of this	2.0
	This is how it should be	1.0
	Lets read this number in our hands to ourselves	1.0
	Now let it out	2.0
39987	Way to go	1.0
	Round this to the nearest whole number	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	If you said 40 youre on the right track	1.0
	Round this to the nearest tenths	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good	1.0
	If you said 40 you are correct	1.0
	This ones a little different than some of them so I want you to think why is it 40	9.0
	Youre going to talk with your face partner	2.0
	Partner B gets to go first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I get this now	1.0
	Im still confused	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Round this number now to the nearest hundredth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	If you said 3999 you are correct	1.0
	If I got every single one of these correct Im a four	1.0
	If I got most of them correct Im a three	1.0
	If I was making errors frequently I am a two	1.0
	Show me how you did things	1.0
	Thank you very much	1.0
	Weve talked about the relevance if this multiple times so we should have this down	1.0
	Why do we practice rounding	9.0
	Antonio	2.0
I want to get better on it	Okay	1.0
	Why do we want to get better at it is what I want you to think about	9.0
	Everybody think	1.0
	Why do we want to get better at this	9.0
	Antonio	2.0
If you were doing a math problem youd want to know your answer is reasonable	What do you think of that thinking	3.0
Agreed	Agreed	4.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Lets look at our learning intention today	1.0
	Read this aloud with me please	2.0
I can use area models to understand and apply an algorithm for fraction multiplication	Think for a minute	1.0
	Area models we were making those	1.0
	We definitely know what those are hopefully	1.0
	An algorithm	1.0
	If you dont remember that word see how its highlighted then at the bottom	1.0
	Can you read that for us please	2.0
	What does that say Colt	2.0
A set of step by step instructions to doing something such as carrying out  into a solution or solving a problem	Okay it seems people are agreeing	1.0
	Algorithm that word shouldnt scare us	1.0
	Weve talked about this word a couple of times this year	1.0
	Its the process for finding a way to multiply fractions all right	2.0
	Youre going to be looking at area models and finding out Oh I see how we can multiply fractions	1.0
	Some of you have already being seeing that	1.0
	Lets read the success criteria	2.0
	Can you read this for us please Lyla	2.0
Also I can explain how an area model shows one of my answers is correct	How many parts are there to this	8.0
	Zane how many parts	8.0
Two	Exactly	1.0
	Should you be doodling on your slate	1.0
No	Should you be talking with other people	1.0
No	Do you want to know how you know youre done your job	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Thats why we go over this so you know what your job is to learn today	1.0
	All right lets put up the math message please	1.0
	Lets see what we can do here	1.0
	Lets just take a copy and I guess I didnt realize that we needed a copy	1.0
	I assumed this was going to be after a long project	1.0
	Look on page 177	1.0
	Lets see whats on that page	1.0
We already did that	Oh we did	1.0
	Im still waiting to look at page 177 here	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Fabulous	1.0
	Weve already done it	1.0
	Its a page that has a blank one of these area models for you to fill out	1.0
	Page 177	1.0
	Youre working with a partner to look at 34 x 26	1.0
	Thats the top part of the page there	1.0
	Looks like some people havent done it	1.0
	Some people have done it so if youve already done it youre going to interact with your partner all ready ready and some of us are going to do it right now	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	We want to draw a rectangle that has an area equal to 34 x 23 what should the dimensions of our shaded rectangle be	8.0
	Lyla	2.0
Wait no	What are the dimensions of this rectangle	8.0
26 x 34	What do you guys think of that thinking	3.0
	Thank you people are agreeing with that	1.0
	I dont want to use that sorry I dont want to use that at this point	1.0
	I want you to think this through	1.0
	How could we mark the number lines to help us draw a rectangle thats 34 x 23 unit	8.0
	How can we mark the number lines Zane	8.0
	Looking at yours because its marked how can we mark the number lines so that we can make the dimensions of that	8.0
	What do you guys say of his thinking	3.0
	Hes saying it very uncertainly No why would you want to use the tick marks	1.0
So you dont have to count what the dimensions are you can just look where the shaded ends where to mark	See up here if you have those tick marks its really clear where to shade to isnt	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Zane did you see the relevance of that	2.0
Yes	Okay because you seemed a little unsure the way you it so you labelled it what	8.0
	Does that make sense now	2.0
Yes	All right	1.0
	Weve already got them or drawn but you have to label the tick marks so what did you label this Xaxis this number line here	8.0
	What were the tick marks labelled Harley	8.0
There were the Xaxis that were labeled 13	Thank you	1.0
	What would the would the one whole potentially be labeled	8.0
44	44 thats the fraction component of that	5.0
	What would the Yaxis the vertical axis be labeled	8.0
	Thank you Harley	1.0
	Haitus	2.0
There would be labeled 66	The whole axis	2.0
No the whole axis	The first tick mark would be	8.0
16 26 36 46 56 and 66 or one whole	There you go	1.0
	Jorge I dont how this this built up do you see no one sharing the answers	2.0
	Do you hear that	2.0
	Do you hear how could you be fixing yours and adding those labels	2.0
	Because as I walk around the room most people have it labelled	1.0
	Way to go thank you	1.0
	Now Im going to ask somebody throw their completed model under here and show how it demonstrates where that is 34 x 23	1.0
	Lets have Titus	2.0
	Thank you Titus	1.0
	He is not to busy he has to come	1.0
	Can you throw a number there so you can show us how your model demonstrates the product of 34 and 23	8.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I need you to speak up so we can actually hear you	1.0
This is  34 by 26 and that explains it	Elise what are you trying to say	2.0
The width of the shade would be I think 34	I think a lot of us would say thats the length and then the width would be here	5.0
	Would that change if you clip it	2.0
No	No it could look the same	5.0
	Can you leave that up there real quick	1.0
	You said something that was a great modeling for other students because I see some people counting each of those squares theyve count all the squares but you did something can you explain that part again real quick for everybody that didnt catch it	8.0
you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent	Thank you	1.0
	Exactly its efficient because if you count on thats definitely work but thats more efficient	1.0
	Nice job Titus a round of applause way to go	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Im going to have you do the problem number two make sure you read all the directions	1.0
	When youre finished doing problem number two your job is to explain your thinking just the way you saw Titus explain his thinking all right	2.0
	Questions	2.0
	Thank you there you go	1.0
	I see most students have already completed number two and youre sure of your thinking you can go on to number three and share your thinking	1.0
	Remember the learning intention is to develop an algorithm	1.0
	What would be the strategy to multiplying fraction where youre not making these area models	1.0
	Area model proves your thinking but be looking for that pattern that algorithm you could  Thank you	1.0
	Lets hear some conjectures about what you think the algorithm would be	8.0
	What do you think the algorithm would be	8.0
	Thats what you were talking about with your partners right	2.0
	What do you think the algorithm is	8.0
	Noelle	2.0
I think the algorithm is	Lets think back to the word algorithm	1.0
	Its the process or the step	1.0
	Was it going to be an answer to a computation problem	2.0
No	No its not	5.0
Itll get you that	It gets you that	5.0
	Exactly	1.0
	You were supposed to be talking with your partner	1.0
	Looking at your work all the problems youve been doing whats the pattern youre seeing to getting these answers	8.0
	Whats the pattern that you see	8.0
	Youre looking at how to do this in an efficient way	1.0
	Whats the pattern that you see Gray	8.0
The pattern I see is that when you see the multiplication problem like 56 x 14 you tend to do the numerator time the numerator like 5 x 1 but then do the denominator times the denominator 6 x 4 and then when you multiply the numerators you got the numerator of your answer and when you multiply the denominator you got the denominator of your answer which was 524	I love the way that you explained it	1.0
	Its an algorithm	1.0
	You multiply the numerators to get the new product	1.0
	You multiply the denominators to get the denominator God bless you of the new product	1.0
	Look at all your examples on those two pages	1.0
	Do they follow that rule	2.0
Yes	Dont just say yes look	1.0
	Analyze it	1.0
	Does that rule work in each of those instances	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Now I want you to write that algorithm	1.0
	Turn the page to 178 please	1.0
	See how it says in your own words describe the methods for multiplying fractions discovered in class	1.0
	If you need some words spelled for you look up at the word bank	1.0
	Numerator I know would be one	1.0
	Whats another word that youd like spelled	8.0
	Aspen	2.0
Denominator	Denominator	4.0
	When we use this vocabulary it makes out explanation really clear	1.0
	Whats another word that youd like	8.0
Algorithm	Algorithm	4.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Im just going to add the word common here	1.0
	Do we need a common denominator here	2.0
	Does that rule involve a common denominator	2.0
	Look at the examples	1.0
	Look at the one on the left	1.0
	3 x 2  6	1.0
	5 x 3  15	1.0
	Do we need common denominator	2.0
	No	1.0
	Ive written it there for you but you dont need it	1.0
	Colt	2.0
Multiply	Multiply	4.0
	Aspen	2.0
Fraction	This word hasnt come up but Im guessing you might want it	1.0
	Whats the answer to a multiplication problem called	8.0
	Everybody say it	2.0
Product	In your own words explain that algorithm	8.0
	Do you want to rehearse it with your partner first	2.0
	You want to just say it first to your partner	2.0
	Why dont you explain it to your shoulder partner	8.0
	Make sure you both get a turn explaining it before you write	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	We just came across another that we need to add	1.0
	What is it  Factors	1.0
	Because the two numbers are multiplying are factors	1.0
	That will help your explanation be much more clear if you use that word	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	When you have that rule written up stand up please	2.0
	Thats what were saying whats the method for multiplying fractions	1.0
	Im starting to see the same	1.0
	I feel like then you should say Then multiply the denominators or	1.0
the denominator	Yes	1.0
Okay	This is what were writing right here so youve got to be  30 seconds	1.0
	were talking about	1.0
	Ms Carter I noticed that hers was precise but concise	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	She used math vocabulary and it was legible	1.0
	She had everything I was looking for as a model	1.0
	This is an exemplar	1.0
	Go ahead and read that for us Dakota	2.0
Next you multiply both denominators to get the next part of your product	The only thing I guess I would let you multiply is both denominators to get the denominator of your the product	1.0
	Its clear why youre multiplying because otherwise its not specific	1.0
	I didnt notice that but nicely done	1.0
	Very nicely done	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Ms Carter Lets see	1.0
	Somebody else is like I think I have it	1.0
	Cyrus	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Okay Cyrus	2.0
What I said is the algorithm of multiplying fractions is first you have to multiply both of the numerators to get the new numerator product then you have to multiply both denominators to get the new product then put both of the new products together	Love most of this	1.0
	That second part gets a little shaky	1.0
	Thats the part that I think were all going Eeek	1.0
	The first part even the part where you explain how to get the numerator but then you get to the denominator see where it says multiply both denominators to get the new product the new what part of the product	8.0
	The new denominator of the product and then when you said Then put them together you dont need that	1.0
	You dont need that	1.0
	You just explained	1.0
	This is how you find the numerator and this is how you find the denominator thats your product	1.0
	Very nicely done	1.0
	Most of it is sounding great	1.0
	Just make that small revision	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Ms Carter Weve had two good models to do your fix ups	1.0
	Check your work	1.0
	Check your work	1.0
	Modify your work based on the feedback you just got that you saw	1.0
	Are we still doing area models	2.0
No	We are moving away from the area model	1.0
	The area model was to prove to you that this works	1.0
	Now thats youve seen the proof of that youre noticing the pattern so you should not be mentioning anything about area models	1.0
	If you feel like youve got yours written clearly youve made revisions go ahead and work on that journal page 179  is multiply the numerators and youre multiplying numerators while combining	1.0
	Numerators of the product	1.0
	Then multiply the denominators we call them the denominator of the product okay	2.0
	You just add those two parts  If you need a straight edge and you dont want to use a book or something theres templates that you could use	1.0
	nice job	1.0
	all the numerators  common denominator	2.0
	No	1.0
	and the answer was  Is 2 x 2 4	2.0
	Is 3 x 3 9	2.0
	Is 3 x 1 3	2.0
	Is 4 x 4 16	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	thinking about what weve been talking about	1.0
	Youll need to focus	1.0
	Sitting there being quiet is not	1.0
	1 x 3 is what	8.0
1 x 3 is 3	Good	1.0
	Thats the numerator	1.0
	2 x 6 is what	8.0
2 x 6 is 2 I mean 12	Thats your denominator	1.0
	Whatever you do in the bottom you do to the top here	1.0
	You need to find a common denominator	1.0
	You act like you know what youre doing	1.0
	thats why I got out templates	1.0
Yes	Straight edge it makes your work much more readable	1.0
	Good looks like you know about applying algorithms	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Good looks like you know how to apply algorithms	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Looks like you know how to apply the algorithm way to go	1.0
	Where does this start	8.0
	Because when you say then it implies that there was something before it	1.0
	First you multiply both denominators with the denominator  I know youve got the numerator  because  the numerators together  the answer	1.0
	You see that was the feedback supposed to be for sharing	1.0
	Is that helpful does that matter	2.0
Im confused	According to this file the	1.0
	to talk to you	1.0
	Can we take a time out	1.0
	First of all youre amazing	1.0
	You get marbles because this is amazing hard work but I want you to raise eyes on me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I want you to know	1.0
	Ms Carter Just kidding	1.0
	How do you know that your product is correct	8.0
	We keep talking about rounding is rounding going to help us decide if our product is correct here	2.0
	No	1.0
	How are you going to know that your product is accurate	8.0
	What would be a way to check this	8.0
	Yes good	1.0
	I love it	1.0
	People in agreement	1.0
	That is confusing	1.0
	I love it	1.0
	I want you to see if you can think of something so think tank	1.0
	Can we talk about this on another day	1.0
	It may have washed over you because new learning takes a while to secure itself	1.0
	I want you to share your thinking at your teams	1.0
	Share everybodys idea and honor somebody who doesnt have an idea thats fine too	1.0
	Show your idea	1.0
	How are you going to check originalness	8.0
	Does anybody feel like Yes we came up with it	2.0
	Dakota	2.0
My team was talking about you would take the denominator of your product and divide it by one of the denominators of the factors and then if you get the denominator of the other factor that you didnt divide your product denominator by you multiply the denominator and you would do the same thing for the numerators	That would work	1.0
	I agree	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	That would work	1.0
	I think theres a less complicated way but that would definitely work	1.0
	Harley	2.0
If you were finding out half of 34 for example you would probably get  less than what youre finding of 34 and if you get something bigger your algorithm is not correct	Nice job	1.0
	Can your product be bigger than either of the factors	2.0
	No	1.0
	Because youre finding a fraction of a fraction when youre multiplying	1.0
	Your product has to be smaller than both than your factors	1.0
	Nice job Harley	1.0
	Way to use your math mind masterfully	1.0
	Lets give her a round of applause	1.0
	Ms Carter Keep going	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	is 14 smaller than 13	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Is it smaller than 34	2.0
	Likely this is  Why do you feel like this is  These are two different fractions	1.0
	This is a half times a half	1.0
	Finding half of a half	1.0
	It just didnt look right at first but now I can see	1.0
	I think both of them are correct	1.0
	Can they both  think about 12 3 x 4  12	1.0
	2 x 6  12	1.0
	As much as you think you dont need me you do because I give you some other things to think about	1.0
	Thats how youre going to grow and Im going to grow right there next to you	1.0
	My goal for you is to see as far you can get in three minutes and then you can check your work with your teams	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Youve gone as far as you could	1.0
	You are checking work at your team so you should have checking material up	1.0
	My friends that are writing with those cool erasable pen love love love them	1.0
	That would be so me	1.0
	I would love them but if you check your work using that same checking material is it clear to you	2.0
	If you want to use a different cool cool erasable pen to check your work	1.0
	Share your work compare answers share your thinking	3.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Lets go back to the first criteria and see how we did here	1.0
	Whats that	2.0
	Remind me when were done here to talk to you about math solutions	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets look at this learning intention	1.0
	Zane can you read it orthe success criteria  for us	2.0
I will know I can do it when I can successfully use an algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two to seven	Two through	1.0
Also I can explain how the area model shows one of my answers is correct	People are feeling successful	1.0
	Excellent nicely done	1.0
	Please get a copy of the homework	1.0
	Youll get your game on it	1.0
Almost like what we talked about in the first place	10 seconds are left	1.0
Genius you should know this	What do you have	8.0
	So you just keep the same base	1.0
	You dont double the base	1.0
	Dont forget that for this part you should be able to use your toolkit	1.0
That works too	Yes you dont have to solve it	1.0
Im still doing it because Im still	Its not a bad plan	1.0
125 to the power of 23	Thats awesome	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Thank you sir	1.0
	Ill get that graded for you and get it back tomorrow	1.0
	All right youve got to get control of this group	1.0
	Yes you were supposed to be the genius	1.0
Thats probably wrong	All right everybody is just about done with one and two	1.0
	Those answers are on the board for you to check your work	1.0
	So how can I use maybe this portion	1.0
I got mostly the right answers	Anything to the zero power is what	8.0
Zero	No	1.0
Oh one	One	4.0
	is the answer to that one	1.0
Yes Im a genius	If were starting right now with what was it 98 or 96	8.0
	98   and two to the half	5.0
	How can I rewrite it using this property	8.0
The brilliance at this table is impeccable	1024 is it a multiple of four	2.0
	So think about that would be four times of what	8.0
	Okay so what would this simplify to if I have a four  and Im taking the what root of that	8.0
	All right have you checked your answers to one and two	2.0
	Have you checked your answers	2.0
	And some of you are done with three	1.0
	so there is the answers to three	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen one more minute and then were going to jump into the textbook for a few minutes and then well take a break	1.0
	Yes I think we will	1.0
That was the longest five minutes	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen were going to be on the textbook	1.0
	Lets see this is page What page	1.0
		1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Were on page 200	1.0
	Textbook page 200	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	Eight and nines up here please	1.0
	He knew what I was saying	1.0
	All right so example number one are some of the properties youve already applied	1.0
	You noticed how if were on the same level we can add exponents and it simplifies our process	1.0
	Same thing happening here if you are on the level we add those exponents	1.0
	If theyre on Actually in this case since its this times itself they raised each of those to the power of two multiplied those together	1.0
	So power to power we multiply	1.0
	On the same level were adding	1.0
	Power to power we multiplied out here simplified our answer process	1.0
	Here we have something thats raised to a negative 15	1.0
	Notice how that negative was carried all the way through and the simplification was done at the end	1.0
	Now thats not There are alternative ways of solving these as well as you guys were figuring out	1.0
	I mean you could work on whats the fourth root of seven times the square root of seven but thats going to be a little bit more complex	1.0
	So youre going to use these properties to help simplify things down to their simplest form	1.0
	I think you worked problems like this	1.0
	Does anybody have any questions on this particular style of applying those	2.0
	Natalia you would be a great candidate	1.0
	Do these make sense to you now	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	All right cool	1.0
	Well do one more example and then well take a break	1.0
	In our toolkits open your toolkit so that youve got this in front of you	1.0
	That was part of what we gave you in the toolkit	1.0
	If we look at this first example notice if our index is the same and were multiplying so this is important that its multiplication we can simplify this and put everything under one radical and simplify that	1.0
	Then in our second example notice again when our index is the same And were dividing now	1.0
	Up here our index was the same when we were multiplying here our index is the same and were dividing we can combine under one radical	1.0
	Thats the property thats being worked right here	1.0
	Any questions on those two	2.0
	I think you used those two in some of those practice problems as well	1.0
	Okay lets go ahead and well take a break	1.0
	When we come back well look at example three	1.0
	There was a desire to break to the commons	1.0
Yes	All right so you got 10 minutes to be at the double doors	1.0
	Set your timer	1.0
	10 minutes be at the double doors	1.0
Im getting apple juice	Thank you Andy	1.0
	I need to put a sign out	1.0
	Ill be back	1.0
	Okay were good	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	How are you doing today	1.0
good	Good	1.0
And you	Im doing fine	1.0
	What did you do over the weekend	1.0
	Its nice to do nothing	1.0
	Who lives in your home	1.0
	Your mom dad	1.0
	Brothers sisters	1.0
A sister	Good	1.0
	If youre in Greenfield you live in the City of Greenfield	1.0
	Your house	1.0
yes	Yes	1.0
	How did you come here	1.0
	All right were going to be on page 201	1.0
Journal or	Textbook	1.0
	Textbook 201	1.0
	All right page 201	1.0
	All right lets get those phones put away gentlemen	1.0
Were on 201	All right so I want to walk you through several examples here	1.0
	In this first one the recommendation is to factor out any perfect cube	1.0
	Now we havent worked with perfect cubes very much so we kind of have to start thinking about that	1.0
	What would 23 be	8.0
Eight	Eight	4.0
	33	8.0
	43	8.0
Hold up let me check this	Four times four you have	8.0
	Times four	1.0
	Perfect cube	1.0
I think so but I dont know	Yes there is a format for your calculator to do   yes	1.0
	So you can	1.0
	All right lets continue on	1.0
	Whats 53	8.0
	125 all right	5.0
	That was a little bit easier	1.0
Whats the square root	All right so in your toolkit so your second toolkit lets just go ahead and write what these are	1.0
	23 33 43 53 and 63	1.0
	Lets	1.0
	In your toolkit were going to add these perfect cubes	1.0
Only intelligent	Well do it this way so that it catches the front of the room	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Eyes up front please	1.0
	Now if you dont recognize that 27 is a factor of 135 who would	2.0
	I mean were probably not expected to do that	1.0
	When we look at 135 what do we know is a factor	8.0
Five	Five because it ends in five so I can start my factoring just by dividing that by five	5.0
	5goes into 13 two times with three left over	1.0
	5 goes into 35 seven times	1.0
	If were recognizing that 27 is a perfect cube we could stop there or I could think about what the factors of 27 3x9 and 5x3x3x3	1.0
	If it helps you to factor down this way so that since Im looking for a cube root and I see that Ive got those three 3s thats where you see the one 3 being pulled out in front with 5 being left behind	1.0
	Any questions on that	2.0
	Then if we look at this next one whats happening here	8.0
	When do they go from this to this whats happening	8.0
Magic	Yes it does kind of look like magic	5.0
	Hold on let me get this	1.0
	Were going to put that in the toolkit today	1.0
	Now let me ask you this what does this equal	8.0
	Look very carefully up here this is important	1.0
	This equals one	1.0
	Now if I multiply by one am I changing my number	2.0
Not necessarily  its getting more specific in terms of	If I take seven and multiply it times one its still seven right	2.0
Yes	If I multiply 7x2x2 my  step can multiply across	1.0
	I have 142	1.0
	Is it still seven	2.0
Yes	Yes so why are we finding some sort of one to multiply our problem by	9.0
To remove the radical from the denominators	Exactly	1.0
	In simplifying things you cannot have an answer that has a radical in the denominator so you got to get rid of that	1.0
	Notice what Im multiplying by here	1.0
	If we focus on what was chosen to multiply this by 8 is 2x2x2 right	2.0
Yes	What kind of root are we taking here	8.0
A fifth	A fifth root so I need two more 2s	5.0
	Basically in order to take a fifth root right I have to have five 2s in order to take a fifth root	1.0
	Thats why were multiplying by the fifth root of four	1.0
	Ive got one two three 2s there two 2s right there	1.0
	That gives me the five 2s I need because watch what happens right here	1.0
	Lets track just what happens in the denominator	1.0
	Notice that I end up simplifying to a single number and theres no radical in the denominator	1.0
	I like it	1.0
	One more time to give out this one	1.0
	Im starting	1.0
	Lets see I want to enlarge this a little bit	1.0
	Looking at this guy so this is our prompt	1.0
	Were starting with something that 7  8 isnt going to simplify	1.0
	If this had been 32 for example up here then we want to do 32  8 all to the one fifth power type thing or the fifth root of 328 because we can simplify that	1.0
	In this particular case were basically stuck not being able to simplify the 7 and the 8 at all and so were doing something called rationalizing the denominator	1.0
	I have to come up with something to multiply it by so that I get a whole number answer	1.0
	Thats whats happening here	1.0
	We have to figure out well whats our fancy form of one that were going to multiply by	1.0
	This example is also what I have for you to put into your toolkit	1.0
	Id like you to read through the information thats here on this page	1.0
	In other words this little piece of paper it is another toolkit thing so youre going to just slap this into the second toolkit	1.0
	Its something else to add to that toolkit	1.0
	Lets go	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	The narrative on the right side of that paper is an important definition of what it means to put an expression in simplest form	1.0
	No radicands have perfect nth powers as factors	1.0
	In other words I shouldnt have eight as a cube root of eight shouldnt be part of my final answer because the cube root of eight equals two	1.0
	Now the cube root of four	1.0
The cube root of four	Yes so we leave it as t 4	1.0
	If youre leaving your answer with  24 where 8 is a factor of 24 you havent put it in simple form so thats what this first bullet is talking about	1.0
	The second no radicands contain fractions	1.0
	Remember the radicand is the number inside underneath the radical so no fractions inside there	1.0
	Then the third one no radicals in the denominator	1.0
	Thats what we were just dealing with	1.0
	This is an example where if I have a radical in the denominator how do I go about simplifying that	8.0
	It turns out for this particular problem thats the only thing were doing is rationalizing the denominator	1.0
	Thats what its called rationalizing the denominator	1.0
	The tricky part about rationalizing the denominator is just figuring out what form of the number one were going to multiply something by	1.0
	Once we figure out what it is that goes in the denominator we just write the exact same thing in the numerator	1.0
	Its our formal one that we multiply by	1.0
	Questions on that	2.0
	Probably just need to be practicing it	1.0
	Back into the textbook were going to look at few more examples	1.0
	Were on example four page two of two I believe	1.0
	Example number four	1.0
	Heres our prompt now weve got some fancy thing here in the denominator its got a radical but were adding	1.0
	Not as simple to figure out what form of one that we want to use	1.0
	You see its just rewritten right here	1.0
	What did they end up choosing is going to be the form that we have there	8.0
Oh this is  says Its conjugate	It is conjugates but if I have two things Im multiplying two binomials that Im multiplying one as a plus and one as a minus	1.0
Difference of two squares	The difference of two squares	5.0
	Because what happens when we take the square root of three times the square root of three	8.0
Three	It will be three	5.0
	Important to recognize so the square root of x well just make it a generic same thing as the square root of x2	1.0
	If my index and my power are the same what happens to it	8.0
	They just undo each other	1.0
	Thats where I can then have five squared is  3 x  3 is 3 so 253 gives me 22	1.0
	I now have a number in my denominator so get rid of the radical symbol	1.0
	Heres another way that were going to be responsible for rationalizing the denominator	1.0
	We cant leave this with that radical and the denominator weve got to change it up	1.0
	Were going to use the difference of two squares as the idea and as Santiago was saying we talk about it being a conjugate	1.0
Conjugation	Notice that the only difference here is just that the sign changes	1.0
	Questions on that one	2.0
	Youre getting the idea if we end up with a radical in the denominator I got to do something	1.0
	These are the examples that well be referring back to	1.0
	Lets look at example five so adding and subtracting	1.0
	Notice in this case that my index is the same and my radicand is the same so what did they do here	8.0
Three	Where did that one come from	8.0
I think	This is similar to x7x because the 4th root of 10 is just like saying x I have one of them then seven of them so that means Ive got eight of them	1.0
	If I look over here notice that now instead of being in radical form Im in exponent form but theyre both the same I have two xs and 10xs so I have 12xs so 12x8 to the Then over here theyre not the same	1.0
	Whats going to happen	8.0
	Whats a factor of 54	8.0
Two	Two two times what	8.0
	Twentyseven so its two Oh thats a	8.0
Perfect cube	Thats a perfect cube	5.0
	My 3rd root of all of that we know the3rd root of 27 is 3 and then I have a square root of two	1.0
	Even though I didnt see it right away here I actually have that so we cant forget the three thats in there	1.0
	We actually have a cube root of two thats represented in both	1.0
	Ive simplified that and I have one cube root of two here so 31 and Ive got two	1.0
	We can treat exponents and radicals just like weve used x before	1.0
	Questions on that one	2.0
	Lets keep going	1.0
	Now you know this is all going to where we have more than one thing that we have to do	1.0
	As we start to look at this guy I now have to think about what does it mean to take  64 what does it mean to take  y to the 6	1.0
	Notice the first step was since my index is three Im trying to use an exponent with the same index	1.0
	In other words I want to look to see can I write these as a cube	2.0
	It might take you a little practice to get used to recognizing that 64 is 43 even though we stumbled over that a little bit ago	1.0
	You might remember that	1.0
	Now that Ive written things as cubes I can split them up if it helps to think of them that way and we know that if I have a cube root of something thats cubed	8.0
It cancels out	They cancel each other	5.0
	Two cubes cancel each other out then Im left with y2	1.0
	Thats combining a couple of the properties that we just got through talking about	1.0
	Now were going to talk about a quotient were dividing something remembering that little piece of paper that I just gave you that it said you cant have a fraction under a radical	1.0
	We cant leave it as the fourth root of a fraction	1.0
	Notice our first step was to split it up	1.0
	This one is already written as the index and the power are the same	1.0
	This one is not so weve rewritten y to the eight as something to the power of four so that those two undo each other and Im left with that	1.0
	Then the question is why did they put an absolute value thing in there	9.0
Its not based on the principal root	Whats a number that I can take the fourth root of	8.0
They can be negative and positive	Yes if I say I take the fourth root of whats 2x2x2x2	8.0
Plus or minus	its going to be oops two I was starting to write a four	1.0
	Explain what youre talking about Santiago	8.0
When we are typically working with radicals we want to get the principal root which is the positive answer and the absolute bar value is there to strictly involve with principal root	Yes that goes back to when we first learned square roots	1.0
	When you first learned square root youd say the square root of  9 is 3	1.0
	You wouldnt have said plus or minus three but when we started with getting into parabolas and we know that most parabolas when we graph them have two xintercepts	1.0
	Like we see here with two xintercepts	2.0
	That s where we need to take into account that plus and minus	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
	Any questions on that one	2.0
	That introduces a little interesting aspect to it	1.0
	Example number seven	1.0
What	Wait until you see the Level 4	1.0
	Not yet	1.0
	In these particular problems were obviously starting to have multiple steps pulling multiple things together and learning how to pull in all of those different properties	1.0
	Thats whats going to happen both when I am multiplying and dividing and adding and subtracting	1.0
	Things are going to start to look a lot more complex	1.0
	Now remember none of these things that weve talked about are very difficult	1.0
	Its just when we have two or three or four or six of them that we have to apply and trying to figure out Well what order do I do that in	1.0
	Whats going to make it the simplest thing	1.0
	Thats just going to take practice as you start to recognize patterns	1.0
	When we get out here pretty soon right 48	1.0
Yes	Yes so we dont really have time today to do much practice on this so be referring to the textbook and your toolkit as you work on tonights homework	1.0
	Tonights homework will be due then by midnight tomorrow	1.0
	Its not in there yet	1.0
	If you want go ahead and turn the microphones off	1.0
	You have one more minute to get as far as you can	1.0
	Prepare answers as a team please	1.0
	Start with person number one	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
3 x 3  9 thats right	3 x 4  12	1.0
15 20 and	An estimate means coming up with your idea of what you think is	1.0
	I know that 68 is over a half and so a little more than a half take away a half is going to be a little more than zero	1.0
Yes	I wouldnt expect a number with a five is what Im saying	1.0
No I was writing something better than	Okay back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Last week we were using the multiplication rule of our own to find common denominators using that strategy only one way to find a common denominator	1.0
	Show me how comfortable you are using the multiplication rule to find a common denominator	2.0
	Great fabulous	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I dont need those papers unless you specifically would like some help with it	1.0
	It was just a warmup just to refresh your memory all right	2.0
	Were going to skip slate today because we did our slate doing Bizzbuzz the game	1.0
	Here is your math message	1.0
	Work with a partner	1.0
	One partner reads about factors on student reference book page 72 and lists all the factors of 36	1.0
	The other partner reads about the multiples on the student reference book  and lists the first six multiples of the number eight	1.0
	Tell your partner what you learned and share your list of numbers	1.0
	He said one thing and it says  I noticed	1.0
Page 27 83 and 72	Yes so one partner reads about the multiples on page 72 and lists the first six multiples of the number 8 and the other one I think its just reverse of what he said	1.0
	The other partner reads about factors on page 73 and lists all the factors of 36	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Why dont I have Hunter come here or Jackson go there	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	Cant you just put the book in between you	1.0
	One of you do 72 one of you do 73	1.0
	Did I not give you guys books	1.0
	Here	1.0
Yes	Yes theyre right over	1.0
	Why dont you do the page thats on your side of the book and she does her page thats on her side of the book	1.0
	Theres your book	1.0
Common multiples a common multiple is a number is common multiple of two or more numbers if it is a multiple of each of those numbers	Why are these bold	9.0
Because those are all the common multiples of that	What does that mean	8.0
It is a multiple of each of those numbers because theyre both common and theyre both in the two Theres two of the same numbers in	Two of what	8.0
	Not just same numbers what kind of numbers	8.0
Here its common because	See this right here thats your clue	1.0
	Six a multiple of two and six is also a multiple	1.0
	The multiple	1.0
	Can you say that	2.0
Multiple	Theyre common because theyre both	1.0
	Isnt 12 a common multiple of four and 12 also	2.0
Yes and then		1.0
	The one that reads 73 will solve the factors of 36 the partner on page 72 will solve the first six multiples of eight	1.0
	Then you compare your list	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
To test whether it	Is that making sense	2.0
	Are you stopping and thinking	2.0
	Just because you can read it it doesnt mean your thinking about it	1.0
	Does that all make sense to you	2.0
Yes	Why are three and five factors of 15	9.0
If you flip it around then five times three	Yes because when you multiply them together it equals the product of 15	1.0
	Another factor pair one and 15 also	1.0
Three times No three is a factor of 15 because three can go into 15	Evenly	1.0
Yes evenly	Good	1.0
Then five can go into 15 evenly	Good job	1.0
	Way to go Jackson	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	What are you creating	8.0
	Im curious	1.0
These are the factors	All the factors of	8.0
	I wouldve just started with It says the first six doesnt	2.0
No it says all the factors	List all the factors of 36 because I wouldve started with one one is factor of everything	1.0
	Two	8.0
Three four	Two is Three	5.0
	I wouldve put them probably in order is my point	1.0
Were doing them backwards	Yes four	1.0
	Five is not	1.0
	Six is seven isnt	1.0
Eight is it	Nine	1.0
	No	1.0
	Then thats it because all of them are going to match up with the ones on the list	1.0
	You and your partner should be sharing your list of numbers and discussing what youve learned	8.0
	Did you guys make your list like they asked	2.0
	You guys are done	2.0
Yes	Why dont you work on math process while you wait okay	2.0
	After you do the list and then you could make your list of the factors	1.0
	Try some different once	1.0
Try	Im curious what is it that youre grappling with here	1.0
	Youre trying to decide if three is a factor of 36	2.0
Then you just go in	Yes because you know that three goes into 30 10 times	1.0
13	Three goes into six twice	1.0
What about four	Four times what equals 36	8.0
I meant nine	Four What times 10 is what	8.0
	Take four away	8.0
What about seven	It wont be 36 right	2.0
	Four times nine	1.0
	Four goes in	1.0
	Does five go in	2.0
No	What about your four	8.0
No seven is not a factor	Six	1.0
What about eight	Six times what is 36	8.0
Six times six	You know six is going on	1.0
Now youre going to do youre going to write one	Did you read this part about the factor rainbow	2.0
	Because you know one matches 36 you know six times six is going to be the middle of this rainbow right	2.0
	It connects to itself four is going to connect with nine three is going to connect with thirteen two is going to connect with  the other factor matches up with one of these is what Im trying to show you	1.0
	If you finished go ahead and go to math boxes because some teams are still checking work	1.0
	Youre at the oneminute warning	1.0
Okay		1.0
	All right back to me please	1.0
	It was excellent to see how well you were actually processing that information a lot of interaction going on between people and you talking it and discussing it helps you remember it rather than just listening to me talk about it	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Think for a minute what does the word factor mean	8.0
	Im going to have you do a standup hand up pair up and go talk to somebody	1.0
	What does the word factor mean	8.0
	If you still have time talk about factor pair ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	That was a reading	1.0
	Good job	1.0
things that make up that number like a factor of five is obviously one because one is a factor of absolutely every single number	Multiply together to make five	1.0
You cant multiply three to make it a five	Yes it has to multiply It has to divide them evenly	1.0
	Theres two multiples of five	1.0
	Thank you I like that you went through that quickly	1.0
	What is a factor	8.0
	Adam	2.0
Its like adding it up 5  5  10 and 10  5 is 15	Say that again because Im not agreeing and I see people agreeing	2.0
	Say it again maybe I misheard it please	2.0
Its like 5  5 is 10 where you just keep adding five	Yes I thought maybe people misheard	1.0
	What youre describing is called something else	1.0
	Say what Adam described in your hands say it out loud	8.0
Multiples	There I heard it	1.0
	Say it again louder	2.0
Multiples	He was describing multiples repeated addition is another way of thinking about it repeated addition of multiples	5.0
	Didnt you make that connection when you and your partner interacted	2.0
	Youre right Adam you have part of this but you have the wrong word attached with it all right	2.0
	Multiples everybody say that multiples	2.0
Multiples	Thats that repeated addition	1.0
	Factors are something else who would like to explain factor factor pair	8.0
	Noah	2.0
A factor its not really a full multiplication problem its not like 2 x 2  4 that might be your target number or whatever the factor because youre trying to find all the factors for 36 to get to 36 so 2 x 18 thats a factor pair but if you have both of those numbers you want to take away one of those and just use one the numbers	Then when you have both of them its a pair	1.0
Its a factor pair	Do you want to add to that	3.0
Its like the addend of multiplication	Im trying to process what youre saying say that again	2.0
Its like an addend of multiplication the factor	Pick somebody thats doing this to respond to you	2.0
I see how you think its an addend but I really think its more of a number that is multiplied by another number to get the whole Like a target number but the number youre trying to get to like 36 like Noah was saying 18 is a factor because it can be multiplied by another number to get the whole number	The word addend is for when youre adding	5.0
	Yes exactly for addition exactly	1.0
	Factors are for when youre multiplying	1.0
	Two numbers is for the pair	1.0
	If its just saying one of the numbers that you would multiply by its called a factor but its two numbers multiplied together to make that target number like you said	1.0
	What are the factors of 36	8.0
	Lets say them in order whats the first one	8.0
	Show me you can show me	1.0
	Number one right	2.0
	Is one a factor of every number	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Whats the next number	8.0
	How do you know that two is the next number	8.0
	How do you know	8.0
	Think how you know	1.0
	Youre going to talk with your face partner partner B goes first ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
36 has even numbers in it and 2 is an even number	That is a beautiful answer	1.0
	Nice job using your math thinking today	1.0
	Okay how do you know that two is actually a factor of 36	8.0
	Brodie R	2.0
Two is a factor of 36 because 36 is an even number and you can split it into two numbers equally	Sounds like what Jackson just said	1.0
	Does anybody have a different way of explaining that	3.0
	Falicia	2.0
It kind of goes with that but its like a factor of every even number	Yes I like your thinking	1.0
	I see people nodding	1.0
	Lets go on whats the next factor of 36	8.0
	Good	1.0
	is a factor of 36	1.0
	This time is partners A turn to talk first youre talking with your face partner ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	I like your thinking but what if the number was 37	9.0
	Would three be a factor of 37	2.0
	Why not	9.0
	What makes 3 a factor of 36 but not 37	8.0
Because 3 x 2 would be 6 but not 7	Right very nice	1.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	How do you know that 3 is a factor of 36	8.0
	Falicia	2.0
Because you could split it equally into three groups	You can split what into three groups equally	2.0
	Thats one way to prove that dividing it	1.0
	36 divided by 3 would be even groups	1.0
	I like your thinking	1.0
	Whats another way to prove that Margo	9.0
Another way to prove it is that I know that 3 x 11 is 33 and if you add another group of 3 it would be 3 x 12 which would be 36	Nice thank you	1.0
	Whats another way to prove that Jackson	9.0
Because 36 its an even and an odd number and three is an odd number so 3 can go into 36 12 times	Im back at 36 is an even and odd number	5.0
	Start with that statement	1.0
	Explain how 36 can be an even and an odd number	8.0
Because 36 is an even number because 2 can go into 36	13 times but how is 36 also an odd number	8.0
	If you think about it and you want to come back to us you can okay	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Missy had an interesting way of knowing that 3 is a factor of 36 Ema	8.0
It wouldnt be a factor of 37 because 3 x 2 wouldnt be 7	You didnt explain the first part of how you knew that three was part of 36	1.0
Also three is a digit in 36	I see some puzzled looks here	1.0
	Shelby	2.0
I agree with the 3 x 2  6 and I think with the three is a digit I feel like youre trying to say that 3 x 10 would equal 30 and then you can take the 10 and the 2 and that would equal 12	Is that what youre saying	2.0
Yes	Kind of like partial products	1.0
Yes	People that are engaged are getting a lot out of this	1.0
	People that are not stay with us because thats why were sharing multiple ways of getting our thinking	1.0
	Rate how well you understand factor and factor pair at this point	2.0
	Fabulous because this is really going to help you today and were going to go to the learning intention because I realized I didnt go over that	1.0
	Heres the learning intention	1.0
	Read this with me	2.0
I will use factors and multiples and common denominators to add and subtract fractions	Think for a minute	1.0
	How would knowing factors maybe help you find the common denominator because weve really dug into the word factor here just now	8.0
	When you have an idea stand up	2.0
	How would using a factor help you find a common denominator	8.0
	If you dont have an idea dont stand up but thats okay	1.0
	If youre sitting you want to partner with somebody thats standing all right	2.0
	Make eye contact with somebody so you for sure end up with somebody thats standing	1.0
	We dont want two people sitting partnering	1.0
	Have that conversation with that partner that youve made eye contact with	1.0
	How would you use a factor to find a common denominator	8.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Think about the multiplication rule that you were using for this today	1.0
	Is four a factor of two	2.0
Yes	Or is two a factor in four	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	Is two a factor of six	2.0
Yes	Yes because you multiply to get to that right	2.0
	Two is a factor of all of these numbers because you multiply it to get to that	1.0
	Two is a factor or three is a factor of all of these because you multiply it to get that	1.0
	Whatever youre multiplying by its going to be a factor right	2.0
Yes	All right	1.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	How do you know that you can use factors to help you find a common denominator	8.0
	Martha	2.0
You can use factors to help you find a common denominator because say you had a fraction problem like 16  18 and you would need to find a common denominator	You could use factors for that	1.0
	What is a number that has the factors of 6 and 8	8.0
Then you could find the least common multiple	Least common	2.0
Least common factor or multiple	Can we come back to this at the end	2.0
	Because I think Im asking you to do stuff when you havent had a chance to practice but I think youre on the right track most definitely	1.0
	Lets look at our success criteria	1.0
	Read this with me	2.0
I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work	What was the strategy we learned last week with Ms Ferd and then me on Friday	8.0
	Show me the action	1.0
	The multiplication rule right	2.0
	That was one strategy	1.0
	Its kind of a lengthy one making lists of them but it would work	1.0
	Thats what you have to be able to do	1.0
	You have to be able to use one	1.0
	Heres a graphic that goes with what you were just talking about with factors	1.0
	Your eyes should be on the screen studying this	1.0
	Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner about factors	1.0
	Use this as your resource to help you talk about that with them	1.0
	Its partner As turn to go first	2.0
	Shoulder partner	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
I am just now getting the rainbow part	That connects to make a pair	1.0
Im just not seeing that	Even when you read it or saw it it seeing it again right	2.0
	Factors and factor pairs	1.0
	This has multiples on here	1.0
	I dont see an example of multiples on here	1.0
	To me this is all just factors and factor pairs because youd have to be counting by that number like Broon mentioned earlier	1.0
	Yes	2.0
For this see how it says multiples for 20 maybe its saying that if you count by five till you get to 20 and you count by four till you get to 20 the multiple of each of them	Maybe you should add something if they want us to do that so that its real clear	1.0
	At least this definitely shows factors and factor pairs	1.0
	All right back to this slide	1.0
	Do we need to keep going through the factors	2.0
	We just looked at those right	2.0
	As a rainbow	1.0
	Multiple	1.0
	Think for a minute what does the word multiple mean	1.0
	Thats what Garett was just explaining to us right	2.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	Partner Bs turn what is a multiple	8.0
	Count by that number right	2.0
	2 4 6 8 10	1.0
	Those are all multiples	1.0
	Are they factors	2.0
Five	Thats one of the target numbers	1.0
	Were trying to figure out all the numbers thats multiplied together to make that number	1.0
	Does that make sense the difference here	2.0
	Can you show me an action or a gesture that will help you remember multiples	8.0
	I like that	1.0
	Youre showing okay we have two now we have four now we have six now we have eight now we have 10	1.0
	I see some people showing multiplying	1.0
	I like what youre showing	1.0
	Can you turn around and show everybody yours	8.0
	See how shes showing its like multiplying but youre moving	1.0
	Youre making a whole list of them	1.0
	I cant do your gesture	1.0
	A multiple of a number is the product of that number and another counting number	1.0
	With factors thats a closed set	1.0
	Theres no other factors	1.0
	Its just one set	1.0
	Multiples is it a closed set	2.0
No	No it goes on for infinity	5.0
	You could keep counting that out forever	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	Lets do some more practice with this	1.0
	Lets come up on our slate with the factors of 12	1.0
	What are the factors of 12 on our slate	8.0
	What do you multiply together to get 12	8.0
	Lets start at the beginning and count	1.0
1 x 12	One	5.0
	Is 2 a factor of 12	2.0
Yes	Yes because 2 x 6	5.0
Six yes	Yes so 2 is	1.0
	Then 3	1.0
Yes	Three times	8.0
	3 x 4	1.0
Three	Weve just said 3 x 4	1.0
Then 5 no	No	4.0
6	Yes because 6 x 2	5.0
Twelve yes	Do you remember that rainbow	2.0
	How you connect it together so that you know that you have both numbers in the pair	8.0
Im going to rewrite these numbers	Share your factors with your shoulder partner	8.0
	Partner B goes first	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Is one times something equal 12	8.0
	Yes so one should be on your list	1.0
	What is one times what	8.0
One times	One times what equals 12	8.0
	Anything times one is the number itself so what matches up	8.0
	12 so put 12 down here that way youre doing two at the same time	5.0
	Two does two going to go in 12	8.0
Yes	Yes two times what	8.0
	Its an even number	1.0
	Two times	8.0
Six	Yes	1.0
	Put two then I put six back here	1.0
	You can do them at the same time	1.0
	What about three	8.0
Three should be like 3 x 6	No three times	8.0
Two	Four	1.0
	Put a coma	1.0
	3 x 4 is 12	1.0
	Put three and four	1.0
	Does five go into 12	2.0
No	Then we already know 6 does because we have it	1.0
	Weve got all the factors	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Questions about the factors of 12	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Come up with multiples of 12	8.0
	Just give the first five	1.0
	First five	1.0
	First five multiples of 12	1.0
	You count by 12s so you start at 12 and then you have another group of 12 so 12 24 36	1.0
	Thats what you	1.0
	Share those multiples with your partner	8.0
	Its partner As turn to go first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	12 24 and then 36	1.0
	42 36 because youre adding 12 each time	1.0
	2  4 would be six 1  2 would be three	1.0
	Thats right 36	1.0
36 and then	Back to me	1.0
	Rate how well you could generate multiples for 12	2.0
	Fabulous	1.0
	Today we have worked on factors and multiples	1.0
	We played a game to help us practice this	1.0
	We were playing Buzz and Biz Buzz	1.0
	We just did buzz I think and weve spent a lot of time with these words	1.0
	Were going to really go quickly through the lesson tomorrow	1.0
	You dont have homework tonight	1.0
really fast	Yes that did go really fast	1.0
	I think its because we did so many other things today	1.0
	If you would please put these items away	1.0
	The home link if you need help with doing it keep it and get some help or take it home and do it for practice and bring it back for feedback or recycle it	1.0
	After youve cleaned up for math please get your writing things out before joining me and rest for	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Okay so today we are going to do a fold art	1.0
	Its a coordinate graphing activity and if you remember with the sailboats they changed the rule and then we had to make a new sailboat	1.0
	So if we look at our learning targets I can develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on the coordinate grid	1.0
	I stopped here but I know I can understand this when I can take the original coordinate point and create a rule to make a larger picture	1.0
	Everly	2.0
When does it end	Well theres a day one and theres a day two but basically we dont need a full Math day to do day two	1.0
Is it 410	Okay so we are on 410 weve done 411 and 412	1.0
	Well do 413 and then we have the test after that and the time decimals and coordinate grids	1.0
Not for Luke though	Listen	1.0
	Pull your math journal without talking quickly and quietly	1.0
Without talking	And we are going to turn to page 142 actually 141	1.0
	Okay and were going to look at logo	1.0
	Who can read on page 141 the directions	2.0
Miss did you say 141		1.0
	Grayson will you read it	2.0
	Okay so you could look in there and you could find the points that she used to make this	1.0
	Why is your math journal not out	1.0
	Page 141	1.0
	All right next part	1.0
	Willow will you read the next part	2.0
Amys Rule	Okay Everly whats Amys rules	2.0
Double the first coordinate of all the points	Okay so which coordinate is that	8.0
	Whats the first coordinate	8.0
It looks like your	Gabriel	2.0
Zero zero	Okay thats where they meet	1.0
	Thats the origin but every time we write a coordinate which one is it Nova	8.0
	Is it the x or the y	8.0
x	The x	5.0
	The x coordinate is first	1.0
	So every x coordinate shes gonna double	1.0
	Double means what	8.0
	Whats that mean Lincoln	8.0
Multiply by two	Multiply it by two	5.0
	Just the x just the first number in the coordinate points shes gonna double that	1.0
	Shes gonna multiply it by two	1.0
So that itll be 10 then	Yes and youd leave the second one the same	1.0
	The yaxis is all gonna stay the same	1.0
	And remember in the sailboat we did that	1.0
	We did that we just changed one of the axes to make a different sailboat	1.0
	And some of them we did both	1.0
	Okay number one	1.0
	Lincoln do you want to read number one	2.0
Be pacific in the description	Okay so what if she doubles it	8.0
	Is it going to get taller	2.0
	Is it going to get wider	2.0
	Is it going to get taller and wider	2.0
	Write down what you think is going to happen to the trapezoid	1.0
	This is what you think	1.0
This is numbering with the one right	Yes number one and say why you think thats going to happen	5.0
Are these	Hunter what do you think will happen to this trapezoid if we just change the xaxis	8.0
	You dont have the one l Just write what you think	1.0
	I know you just got in here	1.0
	Charlotte do you know if  since she just got here	1.0
	Carter were on page 141	1.0
	Okay so the rule she wants to change the xaxis	1.0
	She wants to double it	1.0
	So whats going to happen to this trapezoid	8.0
	Is it going to get wider is it going to get taller is it going to get wider and taller	8.0
	Whats going to happen to this trapezoid if we double the xaxis	1.0
Are you going to make us go outside Ms Carroll	Theres kids out there	1.0
I got blubber	Hey	1.0
	I get a word thing that shows the different words that are said	1.0
	I dont want to see blubber	1.0
Sure Sham warm	Maya what did you write	8.0
	Whats your thoughts	8.0
	Hey so you think its gonna get wider	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Did anybody agree with Maya	3.0
I agree	Anybody have something different	3.0
	Grayson what do you think	8.0
Actually I said I agree with Maya	Okay	1.0
	Ruby what did you say	8.0
Well move farther to the right	Are you agreeing with Maya	3.0
I am	Okay	1.0
That guy right in front of me	Hey AJ wants to say something	1.0
So when it says double the first coordinate of all the points usually double means make it bigger	Okay and do you think its going to get bigger this way or this way or both	8.0
Wider	Okay	1.0
I said I think her new trapezoid	Excuse me	1.0
She wants it bigger and she created a rule that should make it wider	Okay Willow	2.0
So it would have to be wider	All right	1.0
	So lets turn to page 142 and number two Selena says what	2.0
It says Use Amys rule to	I cant hear Selena	1.0
Use Amys rule to write the coordinates for the new trapezoid	Okay so youre gonna use Amys rules doubling the xaxis and write down the new coordinates	1.0
	Fill out the table	1.0
	This table right here doubling the Xaxis	1.0
	0 x 2 is	8.0
	Its about one stays the same	1.0
	Were on page one 142	1.0
	If we double the first one 0 x 2	8.0
3 x 2	No zero	1.0
	This one stays the same and then you have the second number be the same	1.0
Do we just do	No	1.0
	Just stop at number two	1.0
	1 x 2 is 2 then you leave the four	1.0
		1.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	We are not eating	1.0
	It is not snack time	1.0
	Remember what I said were going to lose snack if we are eating whenever we want	1.0
	Maybe you werent here to hear this	1.0
	You know what to do	1.0
I can help her	Okay	1.0
	You can help her	1.0
	You can help if you know what to do	1.0
	Were doubling this first numbers and then these stay the same	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	The rule was to double the first coordinates	1.0
	0 x 2 is	8.0
Two	No	1.0
	This one	1.0
	1 x 2 is 2	5.0
Its two zeros	No	1.0
	We put the same here	1.0
	You didnt do it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Who feels confident that they have all the points so everyone can check	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Cora we havent heard from you	1.0
	Lets hear yours	8.0
	Wait	1.0
	Before she says I might want you to check yours to see	1.0
	If you agree give the the agree sign	3.0
Wait did you get that	Okay	1.0
	Say it one more time	2.0
00 24 104 100 and 00	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Now number three Roman will you read number three	2.0
Connect to the points in the same order in the same order youve lost them	Okay	1.0
	Lets just review real quick	1.0
	What do we do first Asher	8.0
Zero	Okay	1.0
	When youre plotting a point	1.0
You do the X first she walked over and then you find the plotter	Then you find my plotter	5.0
	You do X first and then Y and youve bought your point	1.0
	You dont make lines	1.0
	Some people Ive noticed they walked over they draw a line up	1.0
	Those lines are going to cause you not to have the correct shape	1.0
	You walk over then you climb up and you just put one point	1.0
You walk up and then you put a splatter paint	Okay	1.0
	If you make trapezoid okay I want to see the points	1.0
	You make this trapezoid is it going to be the same as her last trapezoid	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Whats going to happen to it	8.0
Its going to be wider	Alice	2.0
It doubles the size	It doubled the size	5.0
	Whats it going to be	8.0
Wider	Wider	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	Draw your trapezoid	1.0
	As you plot each point connect the dots	1.0
Not taller wider	Im surprised that its straight I mean thats still a trapezoid	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	The last one	1.0
	Im going to start taking peoples snack that think that its snack time	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Number five	1.0
	Gabriella read number five	2.0
	Number four sorry	1.0
Be specific about how it changed	Okay	1.0
	Write your thinking use as Josiah as many math vocabulary words as you can	1.0
		1.0
We wont have them tempting on our desk or over there when they get stored over there so well just have them away from us	Good thinking	1.0
Shes the only one who eating her snacks	Tell me why	9.0
	Make sure that youre telling me why use some math vocabulary in your	1.0
I wanted to get it so then we can use it in here	Okay	1.0
	For the rest of the math time we have about 20 minutes you were going to work on making a if you get Aaron do math boxes but you are going	1.0
	to heres Connors original picture and youre going to go through the steps just like we did and youre creating a new one	1.0
What is it going to be	Listen for your voice level	1.0
	A voice level where somebody in your team or next to you can hear you	1.0
Not shouting all the way across the room	We are going to be a one or a two at the most	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	More like a one	1.0
	Okay	1.0
Let me talk with the two	During this time you may eat your snack but the expectation is this is done and turned in to your pocket by the time at 945	1.0
	No were going to do silent reading because thats when I have to have a sub come in here for an hour	1.0
I know we can do that	I will set a timer so you can watch youre working on	1.0
	I will stop you every time your voice level is too loud	1.0
	Allison every time your voice is too loud Im going to stop you	1.0
Hand me a popcorn	Okay Chris are we in a one	1.0
No	Now lets get down to zero	1.0
	Try this again	1.0
	We are working in a one voice level	1.0
Can you be like  subtract	The multiples of seven or seventeens one is	8.0
Seven	Seven times two is	8.0
It just doesnt have anything in it	Great job with your one voice level	1.0
I dont understand	Today were not meeting in group	1.0
	The only reason youll need your math book is if you get done with the green paper then you can get math	1.0
Oh Im already doing it	I thought youre just doing math here you are reading for your green paper	1.0
	Thats what I was going at	1.0
	To me itll be both ways	1.0
I drink	Well what are the axis	8.0
You can double it	Number two it says be specific just like we were in the last one is whats going to get bigger	8.0
	The width the height both	8.0
	Those would be good math terms  excuse me	1.0
	Those will be good math terms to use	1.0
	Lets get started	1.0
Is that connected	What	2.0
connected	Well because I forgot to  so now we have 15 minutes left	1.0
Is that a little computer in the middle	Whats your rule going to be	8.0
Im just doubling now	Whats the rule going to be	8.0
What do you see at	The rule is to make it bigger right	2.0
Thats like bigger than my	Depending on what your rule is	1.0
Im I	Hey Lennon just looked at his and he said Wow thats a big coordinate grid	1.0
Yes	You might even be able to make your rule bigger than double	1.0
Physical	What is that	8.0
It just doubled up	Well that means you are ahead	1.0
What site do you go to	I dont know	1.0
	I dont go there anymore	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	You should have your journal in front of you	1.0
	All right right now the plan for that quiz is probably to requiz Monday	1.0
	I would highly recommend that you go through those  between now and Wednesday	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Both Amara and Cassidy and Briella are all in the photo here from yesterdays swim meet	1.0
	Its cool	1.0
	Do you guys	1.0
	All right	1.0
	You should be on page 95 in your journal	1.0
	Lets get on page 95	1.0
	Were almost a third of the way now	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	A third sounds about right	1.0
	All right eyes upfront please	1.0
	In red up here instead of calling things turning points what have we been calling them	8.0
	Vertices	1.0
	Not zeros because zeros are Xintercepts	1.0
	Remember for polynomials how many of these vertices do we have	8.0
As many as you want	Yes	1.0
	There could be more than one	1.0
	We dont call them vertices we call them	8.0
Turning points	Turning points	4.0
	We use the word local	8.0
Local min and max	Local min and max	4.0
	What weve been calling this has been local mins and maxes	1.0
	Same idea a turning point	1.0
	What could you say happens at a turning point	8.0
	In your teams talk about some ideas	2.0
	What happens at a turning point	8.0
Lets say its going down	Right	1.0
	Has the idea of a direction change	5.0
	The slope is changing	1.0
	Were going from maybe going down to going up	1.0
	We want to talk about those a little bit	1.0
	There is just one exploration here	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Seth could you read the instructions from the board for exploration one	2.0
nearest onetenth	All right	1.0
	The idea here is that everybody learns how to find the local mins and maxes using a calculator	1.0
	Everybody should grab a calculator either your own or one out of the cabinet	1.0
	If you dont have enough for everybody then take turns working with that	1.0
Are we going to have a little section on the test because we were thinking about	No	1.0
	I still want to make sure you know how to do this	1.0
	Yes yes	1.0
You originally wanted this test to have a calculator section	I lost you	1.0
Were the ones	The thing here is concepts	1.0
	Can you properly understand the concept	2.0
No I cant	Well between now and Wednesday I hope your answer changes	1.0
Sometimes I have to check if Im right	Heres the problem with a multiplechoice question	1.0
	I might say give you a thing like X2  5X2 and ask you to do something with that	1.0
	Or whats the Yintercept	1.0
	Well because you could use a calculator and figure that out not that you wouldnt know it anyway but then I have to figure out well how do I mask a specific case and ask a question thats a general case	1.0
	Then I would have to say Well if the polynomial is in the form ABX  times CD how would you determine what the Yintercept is	1.0
	The question actually becomes harder which is not a bad thing necessarily	1.0
	Yes	2.0
Maybe its just a regular graph on the level three	I dont know why thats an issue	1.0
	Some Ms Saunderss say Well I didnt have a classroom sample	1.0
	Figure out how to get a sample	1.0
I have so many	All right	1.0
	Start by figuring out how to match them	1.0
	Dont use the calculator to match them	1.0
	Use the calculator to check your	1.0
Is there  as	I have not seen that there wasnt	1.0
I wish it would keep snowing	Ladies and gentlemen the answers are on the board	1.0
	See if you can improve either exploration one or improve what you wrote for the communicate your answer	1.0
	All right eyes up front please	1.0
	Were going to move into the first concept summary	1.0
	Youll see this in your journal	1.0
	If you would go and just flip over to the one that says zeros factors solutions and intercepts	1.0
	What Id like you to do is simply go round the table each person taking a turn starting with the opening paragraph and walking down through each of these	1.0
	Then also talk about what a root means	1.0
	Lets have the person closest to the door start	1.0
	Go ahead and start with the intro to that	1.0
	Lets wait until we are done with our discussion here if you dont mind	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen open up your textbooks to page 168	1.0
	Page 168	1.0
	Textbook page 168	1.0
	Eyes at upfront please	1.0
	Example one	1.0
	Brad could you read the title of example one	2.0
	Push the title	1.0
Using	Amara read the function itself	2.0
What function	Yes	1.0
	Which one	3.0
	F of X equals	1.0
F and X equals AX	Are on page 168	2.0
F of X equals	All right	1.0
	Below what are the Xintercepts	8.0
The Xintercepts are 3 and 2	Brandon what happens at two for this particular one	8.0
	What happens at two for that particular one	8.0
It starts increasing	It starts increasing so it goes from decreasing to increasing	5.0
	What else would you say Caitlin	8.0
	What happens when X equals two	8.0
The graph will get thinner	The graph will get thinner	4.0
	Aiden	2.0
It hits a local minimum	It hits a local minimum and its a turning point	5.0
	Whats also true about that what have we said right from the beginning	8.0
	How did we describe whats happening right here	8.0
After 1X	We use that term that its bouncing so it represents multiplicity	1.0
	So in your teams talk about what does multiplicity mean what we have multiples of talk about it in your team	1.0
	Well if this is called multiplicity what do we have multiples of	8.0
	Of zeros	1.0
	We have multiple zeros	1.0
	We have multiple zeros that are equal	1.0
	We have more we have multiplicity	1.0
	Anytime that we have a exponent here weve got multiplicity	1.0
	We have multiple roots factors Xintercepts that are identical	1.0
	What happens if its an even number	8.0
It bounces off	It bounces off	4.0
	Were making that connection here	1.0
	Now some of you during the quiz had asked me is it okay that we just draw these turning points in wherever	1.0
	If I know that thats a Yintercept and thats a Xintercept could I just come up here and come down there	2.0
	Or could I come up way high and come down through that there	2.0
	We didnt talk about how just figure out the shape that goes in between those Xintercepts	1.0
	Now whats the simple solution	8.0
Plotting points	Yes	1.0
	Pick a couple of points in between	1.0
	If I know that those are my two Xintercepts lets pick up enough points that we can characterize what that curve looks like to be more accurate	1.0
	All right weve talked about end behavior a lot	1.0
	Brad what do we look for with regards to end behavior	1.0
	What tells us what end behavior is	8.0
If its going up and down	Up and down	4.0
	What would I look at in this to tell me about my end behavior	8.0
If the X value is positive	Tell me how I figure out that the X value is positive	8.0
The leading coefficient	Theres my leading coefficient	5.0
	If I multiply this times this times this because theres two I still have a positive leading coefficient	1.0
	Andy whats the positive leading coefficient tell me	8.0
Onesixth	Yes the one six	5.0
	What does that tell me	8.0
It tells you that its going to be straight on the vertical	Okay so how about the end behavior	8.0
	How does that tell me about end behavior end behavior	8.0
	Think about that	1.0
	At the ends you think	1.0
infinity	Okay lets just take that first statement as X does what	8.0
	As X goes towards infinity whats happening to Y	8.0
You cant really go towards a number that doesnt exist because its	Sure you can	1.0
	You just keep going	1.0
	Because its just a little bit bigger and just a little bigger and just a little bigger	1.0
Youre still going for towards it	It does tell you about direction	1.0
It goes infinitely	What would the next statement then be Ethan	8.0
Thats a specific format for end behavior	It is yes	1.0
	In fact if you look in the textbook youll see that they use that format over and over to talk about end behavior	5.0
	You see its looking kind of like this	1.0
	This is what I would like you to talk about	1.0
	In your teams take a look at everybody knows goes and youre going to be the starter for this	1.0
	Youll take that first bullet and just answer them and then just go around your team taking each of those and answer it	1.0
	Go ahead and get started	1.0
	What caused Y to be zero	8.0
	Those are my Xintercepts	1.0
	Because I have 2 I have X2 and X2	1.0
	I have the solutions 3 two and two	1.0
	Its repeated	1.0
	So theres a different characteristic here	1.0
	Were bouncing off the Xaxis with an even value and itll go through if its odd	1.0
	All right so most of us are in groups of four	1.0
	Those of you that arent you have to adjust	1.0
	I want each of you to take in one of these and walk through all of the sentence steps	1.0
	Right so youre going to take turns	1.0
	Somebody can just choose to start with number one and talk about all of those and so give that person feedback	1.0
	Are they on track	3.0
	Do they need some coaching to change the answer here	3.0
	Go ahead and decide who starts this is important	1.0
Im really sorry for being annoying	All right ladies and gentlemen any questions on these	2.0
Is there any way you can	From these whats always true about the Yintercept	8.0
	In other words 12x1x4x4	1.0
	Theyve gotten rid of the square	1.0
	All right well pick up on Monday  finishing this	1.0
	Also do 39 on Monday	1.0
	If you would please turn off the microphones but leave them in the book	1.0
	Were going to be continuing with our learning from the last couple of days	1.0
	One thing I want to make sure I point out is that after our review on Friday you showed such a better understanding	1.0
	Awesome awesome job especially that group that had tangles and worked with me for a while	1.0
	It really paid off	1.0
	As a class we did awesome on that exit slip	1.0
	The number one issue on that exit slip that got people twos was that the problem was subtraction a lot of you added	1.0
	What type of math error would that be when we look at silly mistake math mistake or process mistake	8.0
	What type of math error do you think that would be	8.0
	Think	1.0
	Todd	2.0
I think it would be a silly mistake	I think so too	1.0
	Total bummer that you got something wrong just because you didnt pay attention to the sign and you made an assumption of what the sign was because weve done more adding than subtracting	1.0
	All right lets look at our success targets	1.0
	Carrie	2.0
	Daria	2.0
If it is it is also a common denominator	Lucy	2.0
	Okay Im going to have you use this because Im seating two feet from you and I cannot hear you	1.0
Making a list of improper fractions	Weve already read that one and weve already read the second one	1.0
	Were on the third one	1.0
Multiply by two or  product as a common denominator	Boys and girls each of you high five someone close to you	1.0
	Lucy if you need a group of three well figure that out	1.0
	Lets do Brett and Bailey Andrea and Remy Lucy and Leo and then Asher you can be a group of three either with these two or these two	1.0
	You choose	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Tell your partner what resource can you look at if you forgot over the weekend how to find common denominators for fractions	8.0
	Tell your partner and you can show them too but use your words	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay class	1.0
	Point	1.0
	Something very important that is missing from our success criteria that I want to make sure that you remember is steps three and four	1.0
	Finding that equivalent fraction which is where a lot of people had their tangles	1.0
	Youre showing really nice understanding of this piece but then struggled with finding the equivalent fraction but like I said from our exit slip most of those tangles were all worked out	1.0
	Were going to start our lesson with a little video	1.0
	As you watch this video be ready to share with your partner something new you have learned	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Dear Tim and Moby what is a mixed number	1.0
	From Dino 11	1.0
	Well a mixed number is made up of a nonzero integer and a fraction	1.0
	1 12 2 34 27 38 these are all examples of mixed numbers	1.0
	Moby and I are working on a mixed number right now	1.0
	Were supposed to add 2 12 liters of oil for the car 2 12 really means 2  12	1.0
	Converting a mixed number to a fraction is just a matter of adding two fractions	1.0
	Well look at 2 12	1.0
	To add 2 and 12 we write 2 as a fraction with a denominator of 2	1.0
	2 is the same thing as 42	1.0
	Now adding them together is easy 42  12  52	1.0
	A fraction like 52 with the numerator larger than the denominator is called an improper fraction	1.0
	No theyre just called that	1.0
	Theres a shortcut for converting mixed numbers to fractions	1.0
	Yes how much oil do we have leftover	1.0
	3 34 liters of oil	1.0
	The shortcut is to multiply the whole number by the fractions denominator and then add the numerator to the result	1.0
	We place that result over the denominator and get our improper fraction	1.0
	4 x 3  12  3  15	1.0
	15 over four 154	1.0
	See Moby	1.0
	Mixed numbers arent so tough	1.0
	Moby	1.0
	Maybe you should go easy on that stuff	1.0
	That video was a review	1.0
	What I would like you to do is either something new or something you forgot and you saw this you were like Yes I remember that	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Go ahead and chat	2.0
	Person with the longest hair please go first	2.0
	Maybe you can pop down and sit right here in this corner while were here on the carpet	1.0
	In that way you can work with a group or you can also talk to Mr Andrew	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	When I call your name I want you to tell me what your partner said not what you said	1.0
	Take a moment to think about what your partner said or if you forgot ask them	1.0
	Im going to give you about 15 seconds to do that	1.0
	Okay so that buzz of conversation is valuable to me because it showed me how that we had a lot of students who when their partner talked tuned them out	1.0
	Im going to be asking a lot more frequently and you never know when what did your partner say	1.0
	Youve got to be listening to your partner	1.0
	Joey	2.0
and then you add it to the numerator	What are you multiplying by the denominator	8.0
	You multiply the denominator by what	8.0
	There we go	1.0
	Thank you for your awesome math vocabulary	1.0
	I appreciate that math vocabulary I heard	1.0
	Sorry Im not rewarding you with much but such is luck	1.0
	All right so I didnt have you bring your math journal so Im going to put math journal page 160 up and youre going to use your whiteboard to record your answers okay	2.0
	As youre going through this be ready to share because its about estimation	1.0
	Again its a little bit of a review in which problems you were able to solve in your head	1.0
	Were not doing anything with todays targets of finding the common denominators	1.0
	This No this is the one with the answer	1.0
	We dont want that	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets see how can we do this	1.0
	Well just have to do it one at a time	1.0
	Number one	1.0
	You are going to write either half one or one and a one half on your whiteboard for its estimate	1.0
	If you can solve this in your head without having to find common denominators and do that Im not asking you to go through that in your head because thats where youre going to make a mistake if youre like Okay what are the common denominators	8.0
	No were not going to do that	1.0
	If you can do this quickly in your head like this  youre going to write the answer	1.0
	If you cant leave it blank and just write one of these	1.0
	Number one lets take about 10 seconds	1.0
	Please do not waste the time by rewriting the problem	1.0
	The only thing you are writing is one of these numbers and if you can do it in your head quickly the answer	1.0
	Youre not copying everything	1.0
	My friends who just did that thank you for listening	1.0
	Share with your partner	2.0
	How did you find the estimate that I see on your board	8.0
	Show me your thinking	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I see a mixture of half and one	1.0
	Luis what was your estimate and how did you find it	8.0
Half	Lets speak in a complete sentence My estimate was	1.0
My estimate was half because	Now heres my question for you	1.0
	How did you solve that mentally like that	8.0
I did	Then you werent supposed to solve it	1.0
	If you had to go through those steps in your head I asked you not to solve it	1.0
	Please make sure that you are following instructions friend because heres why	1.0
	Heres why Ashley eyes on me Im being particular about that because estimating Julia is super important to see if your answer is reasonable or not	1.0
	If you find the answer first and then estimate are you really estimating	2.0
No	No	4.0
	What if you get the wrong answer	8.0
	Does the estimate help you	2.0
	If you use the answer to estimate	2.0
	No	1.0
	You always estimate first then solve	1.0
	Now the correct answer is half	1.0
	Who wants to share their thinking if they got half	2.0
	Bailey	2.0
I know that	Okay and then what did you do to get your answer of half	8.0
I know that to get to half	Yes	1.0
	The estimate of a half	1.0
I know two	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I think half is a better answer than one because I know that one fourth is half of a half	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	If I think of my pie and I cut a piece in half and then I cut it in half again thats only half of a half	1.0
	I know that two fifths is less than a half so if Im adding a half of a half and less than a half its going to be here not here	1.0
	Let me draw a picture to show you what I mean	1.0
	One fourth is half Heres half of a half	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	Julia your eyes are here	1.0
	Then two fifths I know and Bailey was saying like whats half of five	1.0
	Two and a half right	2.0
	Twofifths is going to be a little bit less	1.0
	Im not drawing it totally accurate because this is just an estimate so its a little bit less	1.0
	If I take a little bit less than a half plus that its not going to be closer to one its going to be closer to a half if I were to put these two pieces together	1.0
	Any questions on that	2.0
	Again the idea of estimation is that it happens in our head	1.0
	All right number two I dont want you to write the answer	1.0
	I only want you to write the estimate	1.0
	Be ready to share with your partner how you found your estimate	1.0
	10 seconds	1.0
	Okay share with your partner	2.0
	Whoever talked last time first zip it	1.0
	Let your partner talk	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Id love to see your talking with your partner	1.0
	Waterfall	1.0
	Anna explain your thinking and what your estimate was	8.0
	Everyone show me your estimate real fast	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Everyone seems to agree	1.0
	Anna share your thinking and I want to see active listening thumb	8.0
	Okay Ill put you back in my pile	1.0
	Peyton share your thinking	8.0
I got one because	What did I say you could not do	8.0
Add them	Add them first	5.0
	I said estimate dont add first	1.0
	Share your thinking	8.0
	If you didnt add them first how would you know that the answer is going to be close to one	8.0
Because they all have the same denominator and	Theres active listening thumb I saw up today	1.0
	Share your thinking Cooper	8.0
I agree but not really because you didnt really explain	Then share your thinking	8.0
	How would you get to one	8.0
	How did you get the estimate of one	8.0
I looked at the denominator and	I want to clarify something right now because both people who shared out made that same mistake	1.0
	The denominator does not tell you if its going to be close to one	1.0
	Just because the denominator is the same doesnt mean its going to be close to one or a half or anything	1.0
	Thats not what helps with the estimate	1.0
	What helps with the estimate	8.0
	What have I talked to you about before	8.0
	Cooper	2.0
The numerator	The numerator yes and the relationship between the numerator and the denominator and thinking about what does that fraction Sebastian look like	5.0
	If I would have pictured is a pizza what would it look like	8.0
	Thats where were estimating estimating kind of shows you understand the value of the fraction and so from what Im hearing I see you have the right estimate but that we cant say it makes me wonder if you understand the value of each fraction so I want to you to think about a pizza with nine slices	1.0
	Show me your thumbs up when youve got that image in your head	2.0
	When we did estimating we were looking at these three numbers what is it closest to	8.0
	One ninth	1.0
	Look at one of those slices of pizza	1.0
	Which of these numbers is it closer to	8.0
	You can show me a zero you can show me half like this like a fraction line or you can show me one	8.0
	One little slice of that ninth pizza what is it closer to having no pizza having half a pizza or having a whole pizza	8.0
	Okay so I see most of you here at zero so we know this value is just a little bit	1.0
	All right four ninths whats it closest to	8.0
	Picture four pieces of pizza now	1.0
	Half one or zero	1.0
	Okay I see most people showing a half	1.0
	What about three pieces of pizza whats that closer to half one or zero	8.0
	You should not be waiting till I look at you to participate we should be thinking and participating	1.0
	This is closer to half	1.0
	If I have This is a little bit less than a half but close to a half	1.0
	This is a little bit less but close to a half so I put that together	1.0
	Ive already got over a half and this a little bit pushing me even closer to our answer of one	1.0
	When we estimate we really want to think about the value	1.0
	Now find the answer to the actual problem	1.0
	Write it on your whiteboard	1.0
	Show me your answer	1.0
	Brett can you explain how you got your answer its okay just explain	8.0
Then the denominator stays the same so the eight ninths	Okay thank you active listening thumbs and I love your use of math vocabulary Brett	1.0
	Is eight ninths close to one	2.0
	Go picture that pizza again	1.0
	I have eight slices do I have almost a whole pizza	2.0
No	Our estimate was correct	1.0
	While Im switching screens share with your neighbor how come you could solve this problem quickly in your head but not this one	1.0
	How come you could solve number two in your head quickly and not number three	9.0
	One sorry	1.0
	Anna what are you thinking	8.0
	Because what	2.0
	Number two and number were different problems	1.0
	Why could you do this one in your head easier than the other one	9.0
	is the question	1.0
	Maya share your thinking	8.0
You can add the second problem in your head and not the first one because the second problem had the same denominators so you could just add it but the first problem had unlike denominators so you have to go through the whole process to get a common denominator	Very nice	1.0
	Again great use of that math vocabulary	1.0
	All right no that is skipping ahead too far	1.0
	Okay take a look at this problem up here what do you notice about that problem	8.0
	The first thing Im asking	1.0
	Think	1.0
	Share with your partner	2.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	Anna what did you notice about that problem	8.0
The denominators is	sit down listen	1.0
and whoever added this and the denominator is	Okay and is that wrong or right class	3.0
Wrong	Why	9.0
	Remy	2.0
Im thinking that actually out the	Right and remember if a complete sentence we say its	8.0
Because	Because so can you rephrase that	2.0
Yes	What do the denominators do class	8.0
Stay the same	All right so lets look at that second question now	1.0
	Can you read after it says what you notice	2.0
	Cooper can you read that second question starting with the word how	2.0
How would estimation help the person to solve this problem	Okay	1.0
	Think if they estimated first how would that have helped them solve this problem	8.0
	Capping our markers because were thinking right now were not drawing	1.0
	Show me your thumbs up when youve got an answer	2.0
	Share with your partner please	2.0
	Colton and Piper have you guys talked already	2.0
	Okay Red Robin	2.0
No	Sebastian	2.0
	How would estimation help	8.0
Estimation would help to see if your estimation is closer to your answer	Okay the question is how to solve this particular problem so Sebastian answered how does estimation help any problem	8.0
	I want specifics to this problem so lets share with our partner again specific to this problem so in other words estimate	1.0
	What do you notice when your estimate versus this answer that this student got	8.0
	Okay five four three two	1.0
	Bailey	2.0
That person can see if they did it wrong	What did they do wrong	2.0
	Im asking you to estimate	1.0
	What would the estimate of that one be	8.0
	Let s think what is one 13 closest to boys and girls zero half or one	8.0
Half	Half	4.0
	A 13 is closer to half than it is to zero	1.0
	If you picture that in your head that piece is split into three pieces	1.0
	Bailey would you like to keep going	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Closer to a whole would it go over a whole	2.0
	Would this answer be bigger than one	2.0
Yes	Yes because 56 is almost a whole and then you guys just told me that 13 is closer to a half so thats going to push it over and be bigger than one is that answer bigger than one	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Estimation can help you catch mistakes like this	1.0
	Thats why we estimate first	1.0
	All right what I need you to do right now is your little group of two needs to turn with a group right near them to make a little circle of four	1.0
	We lost our extra so we will have a group of five because Anna is going to come down and join okay	2.0
	15 seconds to do that so I need to see a little circle of people multiple little circles	1.0
	Piper if your partner is Colton you need to go to Colton s circle	1.0
	Actually you guys why dont we make a big circle	1.0
	Colton push out a little bit and Luis you come in so we have actually a circle of six	1.0
	Anna you can join either one of those two circles	1.0
	Again were operating through kindness so gesture and make her feel welcome to join you	1.0
	Okay were going to solve this problem correctly right now in whats called a Round Robin so one persons whiteboard is all youre going to use	1.0
	That should be the person with the shortest hair in the group	1.0
	Everyone else put your whiteboards down	1.0
	Your body needs to be right here and make the circle	1.0
	The amount of time you waste not moving correctly is really ridiculous	1.0
	Colton if you can scooch a little bit so Piper has space to fit in	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Okay were going to break this up step by step and youre going to pass the whiteboard for the next step	1.0
	The first person is going to list the multiples of three	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Group	2.0
	No	1.0
	Only the first person is working so youll zip	1.0
	If you notice them make a mistake you may correct them or coach them	3.0
	Rude	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Pass the whiteboard	1.0
	Okay heres the deal when we did this how many multiples did we typically find	8.0
Five	Five yes	5.0
	Double check did you do that	2.0
	Didnt I write three equals You dont have to write because thats not a big deal you dont have to do that	1.0
	Okay pass the whiteboard to your left	1.0
	The next person does the next step	1.0
	A a group whats the next step	8.0
	Now boys and girls some groups are doing a super awesome job of doing this quickly and efficiently some groups are wasting time because theyre trying to be funny	1.0
	Lucy do we need to keep going	2.0
	As soon as we hit the same multiple we can stop	1.0
	Its okay to keep going but thats also wasting time	1.0
	All right looking at my poster in the back	1.0
	Pass it to the next person who is going to do step two	1.0
	Some people worked ahead which is not following instructions	1.0
	Well youre behind	1.0
	Oh no youre not you already found it	1.0
	Other people missed that	1.0
	Now all youre doing is that one piece and then its the next persons turn	1.0
	Are you sure thats the lowest common multiple	2.0
	All right look at step three	1.0
	Reese can you please read step three	2.0
Find the equivalent fraction using the lowest common multiple	Multiple	4.0
	The next person is only Anna please dont work ahead  is only going to find the equivalent fraction for 13 thats it then youre going to pass it to the next person to find the equivalent fraction for the next number	1.0
	Go	2.0
	No I need to see your work I dont want to see just a number	1.0
	Two people could have gotten it by now	1.0
	Okay Im confused Remy what are you doing	8.0
	If I think back to my learning when we found equivalent fractions we wrote the original fraction equals something six and then we multiplied this by something	1.0
	Thats what I want to see when Im looking for equivalent fractions	1.0
	But what did I multiply that by	8.0
You do both fractions	No thats fine	1.0
	Thats right but what I need to see Why I wasnt okay with you just writing that even though that was the right answer is I need to see that you understand the thinking so you can repeat it for any fraction not just one	1.0
	This should be three times what	8.0
	Pardon	2.0
	Then this one would be the same	1.0
	All right final person	1.0
	Rewrite the original problem and solve	1.0
	Okay five four three two and one	1.0
	Especially my group who met with me on Friday I had a strategy to help you remember what were your new fractions and I dont really see anybody using it on their whiteboard	1.0
	Do you remember what did we do Madison	8.0
We had a box	We put a box around our new fractions with our common denominator	5.0
	Thats for this step so youre not searching through 5000 numbers looking for your new fractions	1.0
	I know your group has finished when they have stood up and theyre ready to show me the answer	1.0
	Okay Colton that was a very rude tone that you used	1.0
	Okay where did 66 come from	8.0
I dont know	Okay I see her work here accurate but then when I looked up at my problem whats that second fraction	8.0
	Whats the denominator of that fraction	8.0
Six	Do I need to do anything to it	2.0
No	No leave it alone	5.0
	Write 26 because thats my new fraction plus 56	1.0
	If the denominator is already our least common multiple we leave it alone	1.0
	We don t have to do anything	1.0
	All right show me your answer	1.0
	I see 76 and I heard one and 16 both are accurate	1.0
	Please return to your seat	1.0
	Snack time by the way is long over almost 30 minutes over	1.0
	You have ten seconds to get back to your seat	1.0
	Ten nine eight seven six	1.0
	You can keep it save it for lunch	1.0
	Dont throw that out	1.0
	What a waste	1.0
	I cant even believe you would think about doing that	1.0
	That doesnt mean throw out perfectly good food	1.0
	No just dont eat it	1.0
	Save it for your lunch	1.0
	Have a dessert at lunch thats all	1.0
	There are starving people in this world	1.0
	You shouldn t waste food	1.0
	All right I appreciate Table 2 I think	1.0
	Peyton you were the one first	1.0
	So far its not your lucky day	1.0
	Your luck is still coming	1.0
	Okay I appreciate people carefully getting up hopefully not stepping on our markers	1.0
	Please turn in your journals to page 161	1.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	Before we continue I just want to show you something really quickly and then Ill tell you what our next step is going to be and how were doing this next page	1.0
	Today were working with mixed numbers	1.0
	We just had Luis you are not allowed to sharpen your pencil when the Ms Keene is This is because I can only come up with six different warnings they re all different	1.0
	Our problem was 56 right	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	What if I threw in this	8.0
	When we have a mixed number and were adding nothing changes except we need to add our whole numbers	1.0
	Our new was 26 right	2.0
Yes	When were rewriting our problem the only difference is instead of just rewriting our fraction we have to rewrite our fraction and our whole number	1.0
	With your purple partner tell them whats different	1.0
	First person tell them the difference second person tell them the fraction Im going to write next	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Right now even if your purple partner is not here my expectation is your pencil is down and engaging with your All right	1.0
	Class what do I write	8.0
56	Using a whole number changed nothing	1.0
	You still need to go through all those steps	1.0
	The only difference is when I write it out I make sure I rewrite that whole number	1.0
	Now I add whats two plus five	8.0
Seven	We originally said this was 76 right	2.0
Yes	I wouldve marked that wrong but whats the better answer	8.0
	Oh goodness	1.0
	Julia why eight and 16 instead of one and 16	9.0
Since the top one is bigger than the bottom you add the seven plus another one	Because hen we turn 76 into one and 16 we have to include that new whole number with our old whole number exactly	1.0
	Either of these answers would be correct	1.0
	Any questions	2.0
	Review whats different when we throw in a whole number	8.0
	Go	1.0
	Okay five four three two one	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Were going to do this journal page differently than weve done journal pages before	1.0
	Its called an All Right Robin	1.0
	What youre going to do is youre going to look at number one and everybodys going to solve it on their whiteboard	1.0
	When everyones finished at your table youre going to show your whiteboard and talk until you agree on an answer	3.0
	Once you agree you write it in your journal	1.0
	With your team review the steps of All Right Robin	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Yes you are going to have to go back to your team	1.0
	They re already gone	1.0
	Yes I can	1.0
	Well in the meantime describe that brown one that s right there Anna	1.0
	Why do I hear talking	1.0
	Yes but people who are talking now were done	1.0
	The people who were talking were finished and they were just talking	1.0
	All right I put the steps in just in case you forget	1.0
	There should be zero talking until step three	1.0
	Were going to do this until 1020 okay	2.0
	If you finish with journal page 160 and 161 during that time I have an additional activity for you to work on but I highly doubt anybody will so if you dont get to the additional activity thats okay	1.0
	You may begin	1.0
	Okay good	1.0
	It sounds like I just pulled the bunch down	1.0
	No you guys are doing it wrong	1.0
	Can you please look at the directions	1.0
	We re on page 161	1.0
	No I did not if I said that I apologize	1.0
	It says right here what were supposed to do Use the whiteboard as a tool so too bad	1.0
	Okay five four three two one	1.0
	It is very clear to me that you either didn t understand or chose to not follow directions	1.0
	Pencil is down to listen	1.0
	Who can share	8.0
	When should I hear talking	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Which step is that	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	Some people were talking straight from the beginning so please follow instructions	1.0
	I will be asking teams who are not to erase 10 points off of their points okay	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You guys already showed and talked	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	What number are you guys on	1.0
Eight	Just do the whole problem out on the whiteboard and then show it	1.0
	Do all of number one	1.0
	Okay ding ding ding I dont know where my bell is	1.0
	Ding ding	1.0
	Boys and girls the estimate piece is throwing some people off so I just want to talk about that super quick	1.0
	Its been doing that I hope that doesnt mean its going to break	1.0
	Im trying to find our journal page here we go	1.0
	No still not the right journal page	1.0
	No	1.0
	Is this the right one	2.0
Yes	Youre sure	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	For the estimate thats throwing people off we spent a lot of time on estimating today so obviously its important	1.0
	Look and think thats close to three and a half plus thats also close to four and a half	1.0
	Which equals eight	1.0
	Theres my estimate took me 30 seconds	1.0
	Your estimate should not take you more than 30 seconds	1.0
	If its really sticking you just skip here	1.0
	I dont want the table to be waiting for someone who is staring t the estimate for 10 minutes	1.0
	Each of these problems should take everybody two minutes or less	1.0
	Also if you notice a team member super stuck and youre finished what could you do as a kind classmate	3.0
	Todd	2.0
You can help him	You can help him	4.0
	Yes you have to do the estimate that took me 30 seconds and then you have to show your work for the problem and then you show it to your group	1.0
	Any questions	2.0
	Make sense	2.0
No	Keep working	1.0
	You guys keep going as long as you go	1.0
	You guys have showed it	1.0
	Where are you stuck	2.0
	My only disagreement with Joey is how did this become this	8.0
	I dont see nowhere	1.0
	If youre going to turn it into a mixed number thats awesome but then I want to see first your improper fraction then your mixed number	1.0
	Do you have your whiteboard	1.0
	Because thats what were working with right now were working on our whiteboards	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If everybodys done time to show	1.0
	You guys are the rockstar group	1.0
	Instead of going through this are you done  not the smartest you just work and get done	1.0
	Which one are we on now	8.0
	You need to be writing something on your whiteboard because thats our step right here	1.0
	Write all the work and answer on the whiteboard	1.0
	Im noticing that all three of you agree and he actually agrees too because isnt this the same thing	2.0
	But it looks like maybe youve got someone whos stuck so what we should see as a group is maybe helping her out	1.0
	Im not sure youre on the right number	1.0
	I think thats why shes stuck	1.0
	Were on this one	1.0
	Thats your problem	1.0
	I observed what she was writing down and I was like Where is that coming from	1.0
	She was on the wrong number so that the quick fix	1.0
	Well because she doesnt feel she needs help because she was working on a different number	1.0
	She was working on this one correctly	1.0
	Shes right she doesnt need help and you were right to ask	1.0
	Thank you for being kind	1.0
	Lets just move on to number two then okay	2.0
	Okay so the learning target again is how do we use what we know about equations to help us solve percent problems	1.0
	You are going to with your partner or partners solve these word problems	1.0
	Remember to think about instead of the is over of think about part over whole part in whole	1.0
	Do we know the part do we know the whole	2.0
	Also think about what is the question asking	1.0
	how just get an answer but why dont we just get an answer but thats not the answer its looking for	1.0
	Theres like one more step in the math problem	1.0
	Yesterday 15 of the 126 graders at a school were late	1.0
	How many sixth graders were on time to school	8.0
	Fill that conversation with your partner while you try figuring out	1.0
	I would like everyone to reread the problem to make sure that your answer is answering the question	1.0
	Yesterday 15 of the 126 graders were late	1.0
It cant be	Its not the thing that I put on here to make the heater turn on	1.0
To make the what turn on	The heater	1.0
	Heres your answer	1.0
	If you did not get that answer we need to talk about why your answer is not the right answer	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Who would like to share how they got 102	8.0
	Lynda	2.0
What I did is I had X over 120 equals 15 over 100	Before we go there or continue how did you know that it went like this because I have a lot of kids who were confused and they thought the 120 maybe went on top	1.0
	How did you know	8.0
I knew that because it says of the 120 and of goes	15 of 120	1.0
	It doesnt say that 15 is 120 so it doesnt go up there	1.0
	15 is not is it was of its down there so then whatd you do	8.0
After that I multiplied 120 by 15 which is 1800 and then I did 120 times X which is 100X	Well this is 1800	2.0
Yes and then I divided 100 by 100 to give X by itself and I did the same on the other side and then I got 18	What does that 18 represent	8.0
	What is 18	8.0
	Lynda pick someone to answer that question	1.0
18 is the amount ofSSthat were late	Your 15 were late	1.0
	That is the 15 so 18 were late	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lynda what did you have to do to figure out because the question says how many were on time	8.0
What I did is I subtracted 18 by 120	You subtracted 118 by 18 From	5.0
From yes	120 and you got	8.0
	Did anybody do this differently	3.0
	Okay yes if 100 of theSSis 120 right	2.0
	Thats all the kids in the 6th grade in this school and 15 were late what percent were on time	8.0
	Camilla	2.0
	85 were on time right	2.0
	If all the kids part of them were late and part of them were on time	1.0
	If you know that 15 is one of the partsand you have 15 you have to have 85 would be the on time which would equal all the kids	1.0
	Knowing that could you have put a different number in your proportion	2.0
Yes	If I put Lets say that I said 85 of the kids were on time and without simplifying out these two you have 100x equals Somebody do 120 times 85	8.0
	No 85 times 120	8.0
Yes 10200		4.0
	Divide 10200 by 100	8.0
	You get that X is equal to 102 is 102 85	2.0
	Yes	1.0
Yes	You could have done it that way and is a lot faster somewhat	1.0
	Theres just one last step	1.0
	Really think about what is that question asking you because a lot of you are  Youre not thinking about the problem	1.0
	Okay lets go back to In the parking lot 16 of the cars are blue there are four blue cars	1.0
	How many cars are in the parking lot are not blue	8.0
	All right	1.0
	I think most of you have come up with answer	1.0
	Percentages I just heard aSsay When Im I ever going to need to know any of this in my life	1.0
	Percentage is a huge thing you need to know in your life especially when it comes to money and buying things	1.0
	You want to get the best deal for your money	1.0
	This may not have anything you do with money but this is just helping your brain understand this	1.0
	All right so in the parking lot 16 of the cars are blue	1.0
	There are four blue cars in the parking lot how many cars in the parking lot are not blue	8.0
	In your  you have parked overall equals percents of 100	1.0
	Part of the parking lot or the full parking lot	1.0
	Zara what did you do	8.0
Me and Lane first we did simplify the  16X equals 100	Hold on so you had to do In your proportion where does the four go	8.0
On top	Okay	1.0
	If you looks at this four cars is 16 so how many cars is 100	8.0
	You did this	2.0
	16x equals four times a 100 is 400 divided by 16 on both sides and youve got that x is equal to 25	1.0
	What does that 25 mean	8.0
	Zara what does that mean	8.0
It means that theres 25 cars in the parking lot	If there are 25 cars in the parking lot it doesnt mean that 25 of them are not blue Reagan	1.0
	It means theres 25 total	1.0
	Thats the whole amount in the parking lot	1.0
	Its a little parking lot	1.0
	Four of them are blue so Zara how many of them are not blue	8.0
		4.0
	You would subtract	1.0
	Questions on that one	2.0
	All right	1.0
	You spent 116 at Target on holiday clearance items	1.0
	That is 25 of the total price of the items you purchased before the markdown	1.0
	How much would you have spent before the markdown	8.0
	If everything was 100 you had to pay 100 how much would you have to spend on that one	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Guys if you went to Target and you bought the stuff and it was not on sale would you pay more or less than 116	8.0
More	This 116 is this the whole amount or part of the amount	8.0
Part	Where does part go in your equation	8.0
	Part over whole	1.0
	You did but this is what this is not what you saved	1.0
	How much would you have paid	8.0
	Lets start off this one	1.0
	This one is a real life problem although usually its worked in a different direction	1.0
	Usually you might see the original price and you would know that its 75 off so then youre trying to figure out how much youre saving but were doing this a little bit backwards	1.0
	You spent 116 at Target	1.0
	That was 25 of what you should have spent so its less than what you should have spent	1.0
	Its the part	1.0
	I like that I saw Carmen she said that this is really just on four	1.0
	Made it a whole lot easier and then one times X is X	1.0
	This one is What is this	8.0
	116 times 4 is 464	1.0
	The total amount you would have paid was 464	1.0
	Piece of cake	1.0
	There was no other thing	1.0
	It did not ask how much did you save	1.0
	If it did ask how much you saved how much did you save Spencer	8.0
		5.0
	Spencer and Anderson went ahead and figured that out	1.0
	really read the question carefully	1.0
	Question on this one	2.0
	Im really excited for	1.0
	I dont think its this one	1.0
	Its the next one	1.0
	This one	1.0
	A restaurant served you a 16 fluid ounce glass of juice that is a 30 ice	1.0
	30 of the glass has ice in it	1.0
	How many fluid ounces of juice do you actually get	8.0
	Remember you put ice in a cup its taking up space	1.0
	Thats why some people like light ice or no ice in their drinks because then you get more liquid	1.0
	How many fluid ounces of juice is actually in that cup if its 30 ice	8.0
	Talk to your group	2.0
	Figure it out	1.0
	Lets talk about this one	1.0
	There is a lot of you who came to that conclusion to suit your answer really quickly but it wasnt You guys are not understanding what your answer represents	1.0
	A restaurant serves you a 16 fluid ounce glass of juice	1.0
	Is that 16 ounces the whole glass or part of the glass	8.0
Whole	Whole	4.0
	The whole thing think about it the whole glass is 16 ounces	1.0
	We also know that 30 is what	8.0
Ice	Ice	4.0
	30 of it is ice	1.0
	A lot of you did this	1.0
	You know that it was part over whole equals 30 over 100	1.0
	What does that 30 represent	8.0
Ice	Ice	4.0
	Is your answer juice	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Thats what a lot of you thought	1.0
	This 30 represents the amount of ice	1.0
	100 is the whole glass	1.0
	30 is ice	1.0
	Were using I for ice	1.0
	I dont want to use an IWhen you do this we have ice in part a little bit	1.0
	10X equals 16 times 3 is 48 divide by 10	1.0
	I get that X is equal to 48	1.0
	48 ounces of juice	1.0
	What is that 48 ounces of Travis	8.0
Ice	Ice	4.0
	How much does it hold total	8.0
	16 you would have to subtract the four and eight tenths and you get 11 and twotenths juice	1.0
	You could have thought about it this way	1.0
	If its 30 ice what percent does it have juice	8.0
		4.0
	You could have then done X over 16 equals 70 over 100 because 70 would be juice	1.0
	I would again cross those off simplify	1.0
	10X equals 7 times 6 is 42 112 divide by 10	1.0
	Then you get X is equal to 112	1.0
	Thats for juice	1.0
	Think about your answers guys	1.0
	30 ice	1.0
	If you use 30 thats representing ice	1.0
	The question is asking juice	1.0
	That makes sense	2.0
	You have time for the really hard one	1.0
	If you do not get one of these yellow goldenrod papers that means that you did not turn it in to me	1.0
	I did not put a grade on that	1.0
	Really the only people that were close to a three were Allison Adrianna and Catalina	1.0
	Those were the people that theirs were	1.0
	I did not write a grade	1.0
	They were closest to a three	1.0
	We looked at them us fifthgrade Ms Carrolls and I sorted the people that were possibly a two a one a three	1.0
	I didnt put a grade on it because thats not what I want you to focus on	1.0
	I want you to focus on how to what would make this paper a three	1.0
	Then you can look into your paper and see Do I have these things and if I dont what do I need to do differently	8.0
	Heres one without a name	1.0
	All right so lets First of all can I have someone volunteer to read the problem	2.0
	Okay Adrianna	2.0
Write a number that has a nine and that is onetenth the value of the nine in the number and eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	So we are working on deconstructing the prompt in writing	1.0
	If we were to look at this and deconstruct this first of all what are our verbs that we would circle	8.0
	What are our verbs	8.0
	Byron	2.0
Analyze	Okay survey circle the word analyze	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Whats another one  Byron	8.0
Write	Write	2.0
	So circle write	1.0
	Allison	2.0
Prove	And prove	5.0
	Those are the three that you want to circle	1.0
	Those are the three things that you want to make sure that youre doing when you are doing this problem	1.0
	You want to analyze it and analyze means what	8.0
Focus on it and look closely	Okay look closely at it	5.0
	Write we know what write means	1.0
	Then we need to prove that our answer is going to work	1.0
	Do you feel okay	1.0
	You just look kind of pale	1.0
	All right so lets look at this so we can all see this together	1.0
Ms  does this	Yes it moves towards me	1.0
	Youre not able to see me right now but I dont know that it matter	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	They can hear what youre saying too so  all right so if we look at this we first have to look at this number and it says Analyze this number	1.0
	Were looking for the eight and the nine	1.0
	If I were to write this number I might underline these two because those two numbers are the only ones that are going to change	1.0
	Okay so talk in your team and talk about whats going to happen to the eight and whats going to happen to the nine	1.0
	Talk in your teams about what needs to happen to the eight and the nine	1.0
	All right close up your conversations	1.0
	Close up your conversations	1.0
	Frankie what did your team say needs to happen to the eight	8.0
But they said they need to be switched around	Okay so these two need to be switched	5.0
	Eight and nine need to be switched	2.0
Yes	Did your team say why they think that	9.0
No	Collin what did your team say	8.0
They said that youre supposed to switch the nine and the eight so the ninth to the 10th space then  by one	Now it is in the tenth place	5.0
	Are they saying to keep it in the tenth place	2.0
No	Does somebody want to help him	3.0
	Okay so you think Which five the first five or the second five	8.0
The ninth	Okay so you want to change this right here you want that part of it to look like that	1.0
	Andrea	1.0
Because	The eight needs to go to the tenth	5.0
	All right so show me if you agree or disagree with where the eight and the nine are right lets start with the eight agree or disagree in the place of the eights at	8.0
	Thumbs up or thumbs down	2.0
	Bianca will you show her where the  is	3.0
	Now those of you that have their thumb up you are correct but why	9.0
	I need to know why its going there Jared	9.0
Because when they said eight has to go ten times the value of where the eight is so it would be going up a place	Adrianna what do you want to add on	3.0
That means you would have to do 8 x 10 so that would be 80 and 80 would be in the tenth place	Thats going to help us with our explanation	1.0
	8 x 10 tells us that the eight goes in the tenth place	1.0
	We want to use math vocabulary when we write out our explanation	1.0
	So what about the nine do you agree or disagree where the nine is	8.0
	Remember we had that verb prove how can we prove that the nine needs to go there	8.0
	Damien	2.0
It says Write a number that has nine and that 110 is not a full number so youre not going forward you have to go backwards	If you multiply a whole number by a fraction	8.0
Its going to be	Its going to be what	8.0
Its going to be a hundredths	Its going to get smaller	1.0
	In this case youre right its going to go to the hundredths because it started in the tenths	5.0
	Now here I could write does this number right here fit the rule	2.0
	3281595 does that number fit the rule	2.0
Where does three come from	Thats what I wanted you guys you were trying to make it with this number and that may have been the confusing part	1.0
	Maybe not	1.0
	You could have switched numbers that would have been fine too just like whoever told me to put Was it Catalina	2.0
Yes	Whoever told me to put the nine between the two fives thats fine or I could totally make those five something else as long as that nine is in the hundredths place	1.0
	Heres what I would say in a problem like this even if you had multiple nines as long as you have a nine in the hundredth  as your Ms Carroll I dont know if that tells me that you fully understand	1.0
Nine nine nine eight eight eight	I think its better if you can just have one nine and one eight	1.0
	What Im really looking at is that in the hundredths place you have the right number and in the tenths place you have the right number	1.0
	Heres where the tricky part comes heres my answer	1.0
	Heres my explanation	1.0
	This is where I want you to really look	1.0
	Allison lets hear yours	8.0
	Who are my three people that were close to a three	1.0
	Were going to listen to theirs first	1.0
	Allison lets hear yours	8.0
Then if you switch the eight with the six in 7568 that is how I got 7586595	Whats possibly missing	8.0
	She didnt say why those places go there	1.0
	I understand that she gets it but she didnt say why	1.0
If she would have said The reason I put it there was because it said that it should be 10 times more so 8 x 10 is 80 which would make it get put in that place	Adrianna lets hear yours	8.0
You want me to do the answers first	I want you to read your explanation	8.0
What I did with the nine is I made it go to the 100th place because it says nine  is 110 the value so I would make the nine go in the one hundredth	She has the why	1.0
	I dont know she might have	1.0
I dont get Never mind	Lets look when we do this lets see if theres a reason	1.0
	I put three and I put the three of you under the three but I felt like there was something that maybe Allisons it was the why	1.0
	Im not sure about yours Adrianna	1.0
	Lets hear yours Catalina	8.0
	Her why she has part of her why but its not completely clear	1.0
	Lets look at what would make this good	1.0
	I want to click over and show you something that we wrote down if I can find it that I want us to look at together	1.0
	Lets look at this	1.0
	Heres some things that are going to make this its this problem some things that are going to make it right that you get a three	1.0
	Check yours Adrianna	1.0
	Correct answer eight in the tenths and nine in the hundredths	1.0
	Put a thumb up if you did that	2.0
	If you didnt put a thumb down if you got that part of it	2.0
	That was a silly mistake	1.0
	The next one says explain the correct answer using I think I just figured it out using details and math vocabulary hundredths tenths place place value 10 times 110	1.0
	If you use some of those math vocabulary and you had correct details do a thumbs up	1.0
	Did you use transition words	2.0
	Thats	1.0
	where I think	1.0
	Did you restate the question	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Looking at this we have the correct answer	1.0
	We need to restate the question I changed 7568955 to 3281595 because I had  Im not done restating	1.0
	I had to change the 8 to be 10 times larger and the 9 to be 110 smaller	1.0
	First heres my transition words first  get rid of that	1.0
	Whats distracting over here	1.0
	First I multiplied here is a math term 8 x 10  80	1.0
	I moved my 8 from the 1s place to the 10ths place not 10	1.0
	Next I multiplied 910 by 110 and that equals 900th	1.0
	I moved the nine to the hundredth	1.0
	What	2.0
	Oh that was a decimal thing we were doing	1.0
	I got the final answer of 3281595	1.0
Thats because there was another 10	Adrianna	2.0
If I multiplied 10 by eight would that be sort of three I guess	Yes I think the only thing you were missing did you restate	2.0
No of course I didnt	Then did you use transition words	2.0
I used transition words	Now heres what I want you to do	1.0
	I want you to flip this over and if for some reason you dont have this paper then get a piece of paper	1.0
	Ms Carroll No Im going to give you a new one	1.0
	Im going to give you a new one and you can work on it as a team	1.0
	Sit down lets sit down	1.0
	Heres the new one	1.0
	Up for the eight I dont want a zero in it	1.0
	So write a number	1.0
Do you want us to explain it to	Yes	1.0
	You dont have to	1.0
	All right write a number with a 6 that has 110 the value and an 8 that has 10 times the value	1.0
	Youre going to write a number and then youre going to explain what you did restating the question and using transitions	1.0
	You can decide do you want to do it with somebody at your team or do you want to do it by yourself	1.0
	You can decide but work on this right now and then Im going to collect them	1.0
	Okay friends the first one is a comma and this one is a decimal point	1.0
	Now this one I am going to grade	1.0
	Use transitions	1.0
	Im going to set a ten minute timer	1.0
	Okay now do your explanations	1.0
	Usually you have to go with this first	1.0
	Okay then where the other one youre moving is the eight	1.0
	Where does this eight go it says its ten times bigger than it is now so where would the eight go	8.0
	When youre done you can put it in your pocket	1.0
	You could start off I changed this number to	1.0
	I took because of mine and I said because one tenth because the nine had to be one tenth and the eight had to be ten times the size  then I want to	1.0
	This put it in your pocket either way doesnt matter	1.0
	All right guys	1.0
	Were going to be in our textbook page 136	1.0
	Page 136	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Page 136 in the textbook	1.0
	Notice this is going back to 34	1.0
	34 is what we focused on on Monday	1.0
	Whats that all about	8.0
Factoring	Factoring	4.0
	You need some good practice in factoring	1.0
	Were going to start with the factors theorem	1.0
	Douglin	2.0
	You dont even have your book	1.0
	Youre not paying attention to me so give me this	1.0
	You wont turn it off	1.0
	Give it to me	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Page 136 the factor theorem	1.0
	Our factor theorem is showing us that if we had a polynomial and its got a factor then basically this is saying that when I plug in the K value I get an interim zero	1.0
	That means I dont have a remainder	1.0
	If I dont have a remainder then that is a factor	1.0
	If I do have a remainder then that isnt a factor	1.0
	Im going to show you an example here in just a second	1.0
	If we look at dividing 125 by 25 how many times does it go in	8.0
Five	Five	4.0
	Whats the remainder	8.0
	Zero	1.0
	It goes in evenly	1.0
	25 is a factor	1.0
	Whereas if I take 125 and I divide it by 20 how many times does it go in there	8.0
625	Okay so now we would normally then write this as our answer is six plus five over whatever were dividing by	1.0
	Of course we can reduce that	1.0
	The idea here this is just a fancy way of talking about polynomials	1.0
	If were going to talk about polynomials if we dont have a zero remainder that is not a factor	1.0
	Number five determine whether a linear binomial is a factor	1.0
	Theyre asking us the question is that a factor of this	1.0
	One of the ways of doing this is to plug in the K value	1.0
	Remember this is an X K format so my K value is	8.0
Two	Two	4.0
	I plug into two and I come up with a four	1.0
	Is it a factor	2.0
No	No its not a factor because we end up with a remainder	5.0
	For this second one whats the K value then	8.0
	5 and I do synthetic division with it	1.0
	Now if I do this synthetic division Im looking over here so my remainder is	8.0
Zero	Is X5 a factor	2.0
We couldve plugged in 5	Youre a good straight man	1.0
	If I did synthetic division I can answer the question but I cant go any further	5.0
	If I answer the question and its zero then I can use this to write that next factor	1.0
	I cant do that if Im just plugging it in	1.0
	For example if thats my answer and since I have zero there I know that thats one of the factors so I can rewrite my polynomial with that factor	1.0
	Then I also know that 3X whats going to be the exponent that goes with that three	8.0
	It goes down one	1.0
	Im going to skip the X2 so now I have X5	1.0
	I can answer the question just plugging it in but I cant get to the factoring part	1.0
	The synthetic division helps me do the factoring and then I need to ask myself Well can I factor this	1.0
	and then use the different factoring skills that I have to see if we can do that	1.0
	The better way of doing it is with synthetic division	1.0
	Example six theyre basically telling us in example six that X3 is a factor and they want us to factor it completely	1.0
	Its not just asking if its a factor its saying it is and use that information to do the factoring	1.0
	We go through this synthetic division process	1.0
	We confirm because of our zero remainder that X3 is a factor	1.0
	Then if I drop down one Ive got X to the third	1.0
	I dont have a square	1.0
	I dont have a linear term	1.0
	Ive got a constant though and I write that in	1.0
	Then the question is am I done factoring or can I factor further	1.0
	I can factor further using the difference of two cubes	1.0
	This was also introduced in this lesson 34	1.0
	If I recognize that I have two cubes I can then factor it as the AB	1.0
	In this case it would be X1 and then the quadratic that goes with it	1.0
	Then I ask myself Well can I factor that quadratic	1.0
	Are there factors of 1 that add up to 1	8.0
	No so I cant factor that any further and Im done	1.0
	We practice synthetic division quite a bit	1.0
	Hopefully you feel a little bit more confident with that	1.0
	Were going to practice that quite a bit now	1.0
	What Id like you to do then is go to the journal page 79	1.0
	Journal page 79	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Page 79 lets work number 15 together	1.0
	The first thing we need to do is set up our synthetic division process	1.0
	If we know that X1 is a factor remember XK is the format so X helps me understand that 1 is my K value	1.0
	Then Im looking at the coefficient of my cubed term	1.0
	I dont have a quadratic term	1.0
	There isnt an X2 in this I have the zero	1.0
	I bring down the 13 and the 12 and so I need to start my process	1.0
	Thats the setup	1.0
	Any questions about the setup	2.0
	Yes Zach	2.0
How do you feel like X	Well the format of this whole process this whole idea is that its XK and that what I put over here has to be the K value	5.0
	So instead of just looking at this and thinking about 1 is the K value Im reminding you that the format of this is an X	1.0
	So if I write it as X it shows me that my K value is actually 1	1.0
	Ive got to flip the sign basically when I go to put it over here	1.0
	All right	2.0
	Other questions on the setup here	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Step number one person number one at the table remind your team whats step number one here	2.0
You bring down the 1	All right eyes upfront	1.0
	Very simply that first step is just to bring down that 1 then well multiply to get the 1 and we add them together	1.0
	Then were just going to keep repeating that process	1.0
	1  1 add those together multiply those two together add those together	1.0
	What does that zero tell me	8.0
	It is a factor	1.0
	I can rewrite this the polynomial with X1 and then I have to convert this back into a polynomial	1.0
	So its going to be 1 is the coefficient of X because were going to drop down one	1.0
	This is my linear term	1.0
	That was my coefficient of the quadratic coefficient of the linear and my constant	1.0
	Then ask the question What are the factors of 12 that add up to 1	8.0
	3 or 4	8.0
	4 because we want it to add to 1	1.0
	These are all linear binomials because X1	1.0
	If I was to graph this itd make a line	1.0
	That would make a line that would make a line	1.0
	Thats as far as I can go in my factoring	1.0
	This question is not asking you this next part but I want you to see that when we moved from 34 which was this section to 35 when we were talking about solving weve got to go through all of these and then we have to figure out using the zero product property I just solve through all of those so in each case Id have to say X10 so X is 1 4 3	1.0
	If I have to solve using this method that would be the step that we add onto it	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Use that as your model practice 16 and 17	1.0
	Notice that when youre done with 16 and 17 youre just going to go back to 1	1.0
	For the rest of this period youre going to practice factoring	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets get going	1.0
	That is applying this right here	1.0
	What I have to do is factor Q and come back to Q	1.0
	Actually were here	1.0
	I have to recognize that this has	1.0
	Weve rewritten it as Q so that I know what my A and my B values are	1.0
	So then I can just simply use this pattern	1.0
	Im going to do AB	1.0
For the 6X	Then Im going to square the A value multiply the A and B together times 5 and then Im going to square then new X factor	1.0
6218 thats plus two right	Does that make sense now	2.0
	Its tying in	1.0
	Wait	1.0
	Can you guys come quick	1.0
No	Did you keep it	1.0
You split the middle	With long division we subtract with synthetic division we add	1.0
Yes thats how I do it	Notice how I have a 3 and a 1 but I dont have an x2	1.0
	because weve got to cover it down one step at a time	1.0
	Make sure you do this	1.0
	The first thing I would do in factoring that is ask that question is there a common factor that I can pull up	2.0
	Now I could take out a	1.0
	I could take out the twos and then youre left with three here and a three here	1.0
	not one we have to multiply A  B  add up the B and then	1.0
	This is my map to how to factor quadratic stuff	1.0
	The shortcut is to find the factors of 12 so you do 66 is 36	1.0
	I can just list all them out that add up to 1	1.0
	What was the factors of 36 that add up to that 18 and 2	8.0
	Notice how those two they do multiply to 12 and then they add to 1	1.0
	Did that help	2.0
Can you hear me now	Share	8.0
	You need to come and explain to her how I got the mean here	8.0
Wait how does 18X turn to X3	I do multiply 8  C and thats 9  So 10X is going to be X9X	1.0
	I multiplied 8  C	1.0
Just 8 not the 96	The x2 is not part of the equation	1.0
	So I get 9	1.0
	Are there factors of 9 that add upto 10	8.0
	How about 1 and 9	2.0
	So I do like 1x and add 9x and they add upto 10	1.0
	So I have to change my equation	1.0
	You factor that out and what do I end up with	8.0
	Make sure you havent lost your 2 or your x2	1.0
	It doesnt matter what order they are in when you multiply because we use the same characters	1.0
	Great	1.0
How do you factor	Notice what is the A value for that  You multiply 33	1.0
	Then simplify the what factors of that and the 10	1.0
	What that means is we split the linear term and now instead of writing plus 10x  plus 9x	1.0
	We cant lose three table factors because you notice what X X mean	1.0
	You do I with whats called	1.0
	In other words 3x2x9x	1.0
	Add the x2 out there	1.0
	I am going to do one thing here if you let me	1.0
	because then I can pull that out and that out	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	The answers are on the board at least we can check out	1.0
	Heres where it going to be helpful to do an intermediate  with what is it thats actually cubed plus what is it thats actually  Now I know what the A and the B are in that little part of the formula	1.0
So we have five minutes	For this one are there factors of 2 that add up to 1	8.0
	And that would be	1.0
1 and 2	There you go	1.0
	That tells you are going to be	1.0
	This it had 3x210x3	1.0
	We are just going to deal with that and what was the other quadratic that we had x2 x2  So two different strategies	1.0
	Let me combine them into one and youll see that they are the same	1.0
	If I multiply those two together what do I get	8.0
	I get 2	1.0
	What are the factors of 2 that add uptp 1	8.0
	We do the same thing here by multiplying those two and what are the factors that add up to 10	1.0
	If my A value is 1 my factors are x1 and x2	1.0
	If A is not 1 and I do that x1 then x9 notice because that times that equals that guy	2.0
	No	1.0
	Thats where the strategy is different then I am using this to split that	1.0
	Over here this became my factor over here Instead of 10x  These are the same its just our strategy for factoring	1.0
	This is called factor by grouping	1.0
	I am going to group  so what do they have in common	8.0
	What do I pull out of this	8.0
	Thats what I am looking for for those two to be the same	1.0
	Now factor this so that I dont have any addition in the middle	1.0
	I am not multiplying that by that	1.0
	I am actually taking that and adding that	1.0
	Now I got the	1.0
	If I had 2x  and I factor that I dont factor out the 2 twice	1.0
	Well this is 2X  25	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen hopefully youve got some good factoring practice	1.0
	How many people got one two three four done	2.0
	I have got a few that got three	1.0
	Four	2.0
	What	2.0
	I said multiple times	1.0
	When youre done with 15 16 and 17 go back to one and start working on factoring	1.0
	When the bell rings were switching gears but heres the answers to that extra practice youve been looking at	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen Im going to encourage you to take a photo of the answers and take your journals home or take those pages out and do these practices	1.0
	These are the kind of strategies that you need to know how to do	1.0
	You got to be able to factor	1.0
	Get those answers and then come back to these pages and spend some time practicing that	1.0
	Were going to bounce back into the textbook now	1.0
	Page 147 in your textbooks	1.0
	Page 147	1.0
	If youre person number two raise your hand	2.0
	Who is number two	2.0
	Walk your team through answering this four example three polynomial	1.0
	On the count of three give me the degree	8.0
	One two three	2.0
Three	The leading coefficient	8.0
One	I heard a variety of answers	1.0
	Whats the end behavior look like	8.0
	The constant	8.0
	We need that information for this rational root theorem	1.0
	Whats the root word here	8.0
	Ratio	1.0
	How do we write ratios	8.0
	Theres a clue	1.0
	When were talking about rational root theorem were talking about fractions	1.0
	Were going to be prereading fractions	1.0
	The formality is This is the way of expressing any polynomial	1.0
	Its got some coefficient ese bene and X is raised to some number all the way down to intercept zero which is our constant	1.0
	It has integer coefficients so we dont have any fractions in the polynomial no fractions in the polynomial	1.0
	Every rational solution alphabet equals zero	1.0
	We get that zero	1.0
	We dont have a remainder	1.0
	Its going to be a factor	1.0
	We start	1.0
	In our numerator position theres factors of a constant	1.0
	Numerator factors of a constant	1.0
	Its 120	1.0
	Is two a factor	2.0
Yes	How about three	2.0
No	Four	2.0
Yes	Five	2.0
Yes	Six	2.0
No	Seven	2.0
No	Eight	2.0
No	Nine	2.0
No	10	2.0
Yes	20	2.0
Yes	Those are the factors of my constant	1.0
	coefficient	1.0
	What are the factors of one	8.0
	Thankfully thats a little bit easier	1.0
	with the two in the denominator	1.0
	We can also have positive and negative values of each of these	1.0
	How many different factors do we have	8.0
	12 factors	5.0
	You have an issue	2.0
	Not of 20	1.0
	Were thinking of what multiplies to 20	1.0
	This makes a great multiplechoice question or part A maybe on another three questions	1.0
	Weve already figured out all the possibilities here	1.0
	Now were going to figure out what do we do with that information	1.0
	Im going to test my first one a positive one	1.0
	Then Im going to test my next one a 1	1.0
	If none of them have a zero remainder then Im going to keep going until I find something that has a zero remainder	1.0
	Guys	1.0
	We find out that 1 is not a factor but 1 is	1.0
	What does that mean in terms of the factor itself	8.0
	Remember its the K Im sorry XK	1.0
	Its X	1.0
	Because Ive done synthetic division I now know the next factor and I can apply my math to factoring skills to that quadratic	1.0
	Come up with those factors	1.0
	Theyre all linear binomial I am done factoring	1.0
	The solutions the zero product property	1.0
	Im setting X1 0 and solving for X X4 0 X50	1.0
	I come up with my final solution set	1.0
try numbers or is it specific numbers you try	Notice over here when we set this up if I was to write this I have 1 1 2 2	1.0
	I test until I find one that works	1.0
	Once I find one that works I now know that Ive got a factor	1.0
	This tells me the next factor that goes with it	1.0
Theoretically	Probably not 12 because how many numbers would have worked	8.0
Three	Three of them wouldve worked in this case	5.0
	It wouldve worked for 1 for 4 and for 5	1.0
	You could have had to do Nine before you found one	1.0
	This is the rational root theorem	1.0
	We didnt get to that yesterday	1.0
	We had a delayed start so we didnt quite have enough time to get to this part of it	1.0
	Were going to practice this with the extra practice in the journal	1.0
	Were going to start here on problem one and we want to try and work through as much of these	1.0
	Page 83	1.0
	Were back to the journal	1.0
	Whats your answer whats your solution	8.0
	Right now this one doesnt have 0	1.0
	So how are we going to	1.0
I never signed the form you can use this audio	Whats true about 2 8 and 6	8.0
	They are all even numbers	1.0
	What can I pull out	8.0
	Standard 10	1.0
	What about the Xs	8.0
	Are there Xs in all of them	2.0
	So how many Xs are you going to pull out	8.0
	One	1.0
	So you are going to factor out 20X first	1.0
	Whatever you put to  has to multiply to that	1.0
	Now Ive got a simple quadratic	1.0
	Are there factors of 3	1.0
	Do you have a question	2.0
	Ill be with you next	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Whats the one thing you got to do now	8.0
	How do we solve for R Yes you said that equal to 0 that equal to 0 and that equal to 0 and you have your three answers	1.0
	Otherwise thats 3	1.0
	Then here you pull that up	1.0
	Then the first thing you have to do is  You got the right idea about what you are factoring out but you are going to do it with everything on the one side of the equation	1.0
	If I am multiplying three things and it has to equal 0  because I cant do 3410 Its got to be 0	1.0
	What would make that equal to 0	8.0
	Once you have it all factored you go R1 you 6R10  you solve them all for the R then you have your answer	1.0
	4 out of 80 is 20  Those are pretty close could just doublecheck our work	2.0
	Does that times that equal that	2.0
	grouping those two then we group the other two	1.0
	Now we are in lock	1.0
	So what do we have left after you pulled that out	8.0
	Whats true about 25 and	8.0
	When I factor the difference of two squares I get two factors	1.0
	Whats the other one	8.0
	Notice the difference of two squares can be factors of with a plus and a minus version	1.0
	In other words if I start with this I have a plus or minus version of that factor	1.0
	I am going to have those two factors	1.0
	Alright ladies and gentlemen Im going to suggest the same thing on this practice set is that you get a picture of the answers and then continue to work on these	1.0
	Youve got to be able to factor 34 youve got to be able to solve 35	1.0
	All right in math today we are going to have a constructive responseIf you remember the last time that we did a constructive response what were some of the things that some of you needed to add to make it to show that you understand how to do a constructive response	8.0

	All right	1.0
	On your desk you have folders with the problems and so you can look in the folder	1.0
	Some are goldenrods some are whites	1.0
	Its the Ameliae problem and then Im going to have you talk as a team about some of the vocabulary before I have you report out	1.0
	Thank you Amelia	1.0
	Shes getting hers passed out so everybody can look at it with me	1.0
	Its getting passed out so everybody in the team can look at it while I read it	1.0
	Okay everybody has one in front of them	2.0
	All right so it says a baker has 35 pounds of sugar to split equally amongst 6 containers	1.0
	How much sugar will go into each container	8.0
	His containers only hold six pounds	1.0
	Will the containers be able to hold the sugar	2.0
Wait what did you say we had to discuss	Youre finding out some math vocabulary that would be good for this specific problem	1.0

Is this  to those who get done	Well that should have already been done	1.0
Thats the only problem	Evelyn has a question	2.0
If you want the answer in simplest form or	Evelyn had a question	1.0
	Do you want the answer in simplest form or the answer that you get	5.0
	You can do it in either way	1.0
	Remember in fifth grade we dont have to necessarily have stuff in simplest form	1.0
	If you know how to do it thats probably what I would do	1.0
	If you dont thats okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
	Okay Im going to set a timer on my phone because if I set a timer the words were hard to see	1.0
	Ill just set the timer on my phone	1.0
	All right it will be 13 minutes	1.0
You wont be mad if we just try	I got about eight and a half minutes left	1.0
	Hey a little bit less than four minutes left	1.0
	If youre done raise your hand and Ill come pick it up	1.0
	Okay the timer just went off	1.0
	Some of you are still working on it	1.0
I just want to	Okay you give that to me	1.0
Im almost done explaining	Did anybody when they did this did they write the number of sentence	2.0
Yes	Raise your hand if you wrote a number or sentence	2.0
I think I did	Thats what I meant you did okay	1.0
	Did anybody draw a picture	2.0
Yes	Did anybody use another Excuse me	1.0
	Did anybody use another strategy	8.0
	Amelia	2.0
Yes	Did you use another strategy	8.0
Yes	Okay what was it	8.0
	Dont explain everything you did just tell us the strategy	8.0
I equally split them and I said what the first answer I got and then I used the picture to help me and I got my final answer	Okay all right anybody else	2.0
	No one else seriously	2.0
	Show me	1.0
I used the division thing that I	Okay and is that long division traditional division	8.0
	Is it partial quotients	2.0
I just knew the answer	I will be looking at these but how did you feel on this	2.0
	Thumb up in the middle thumbs down	2.0
I was in between in the middle and thumbs up	Okay	1.0
In between good and in between the middle	Okay well Im excited to see your explanations to see if theyre better from last time	1.0
Or worse	No I hope theyre not worse	1.0
What we are doing the beginning of the year middle	All right friends	1.0
	You wanted to scoot two pages into your math notebooks	1.0
	I want you with your shoulder partner to take about two minutes to just back and forth read through the Get Started problemsolving	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	You have about 45 more seconds to read through	1.0
	If youre done	1.0
	keep recording	1.0
	This is about the voices	1.0
	It is not about your pictures anyways	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Boys and girls we have gone through story problems many times	1.0
	What is the first strategy that you need to do when you see a story problem	8.0
	Talk to your shoulder partner	2.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Tina whats the first thing that we need to do	8.0
We have to make a comment on	Great	1.0
	Annotating it	5.0
	What does annotating actually mean	8.0
	Telisa	2.0
Annotating means write about the areas like what to do and like underline certain words in a sentence	What certain words are we supposed to underline	8.0
	I agree with everything Ximena said I just want to get even more specific	1.0
	What are some of the certain words that we need to underline	8.0
	Luke	2.0
	Youre getting almost too specific	1.0
	In general what do we need to make sure that we underline	8.0
	What type of clues	8.0
	Clues that tell us which operation to use yes	1.0
	What other types of clues	8.0
	Oh my gosh theres an active listening problem for the first group thats two	1.0
	Im telling you that they might	1.0
	Theres 100s and 50s in there somewhere	1.0
	Catch you doing the right thing	1.0
	Clues that tell about the operation	1.0
	What else	8.0
	Ill take volunteers please	1.0
	Avery	2.0
numbers important numbers	Any important numbers	5.0
	Think about Mike	1.0
Any important	Anything that tells me Thats kind of like what Luke said that clues that tell me what operation Im going to use	1.0
	Greyson	2.0
You could underline things that are really really important	Verbs is one thing I was looking for	1.0
	The things that tell you what to do quickly	1.0
	The things that tell you what to do	1.0
	Do you need to explain your thinking	2.0
	Do you need to Verbs often tell us what operation to use as well	1.0
	Take about 45 seconds independently to annotate this problem on page 101	1.0
	I think were fine until we start	1.0
	So we will be finishing	1.0
	20 more seconds	1.0
	No were just annotating and you sir just underlined	1.0
	You need to annotate	1.0
	Annotating is not just underlining	1.0
	Look at your problem if you just underlined you did not do the right thing	1.0
	Remember we write maybe what operation we think we should use	1.0
	We write what things mean	1.0
	Maybe we draw arrows to connect	1.0
Pizza roll 51 year milk is splashing milk	Today is our experiment day	1.0
	Our experiment is failing	1.0
	That happens	1.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	I want the person with the shortest hair to go first explain what you annotated and why	9.0
	Others partner youre either going to agree or maybe youre going to say things that youve also annotated or you might even tell your partner something like How is that important	3.0
	Im not sure that needs to be underlined	1.0
	Because some people will get annotation crazy and underline everything	1.0
	Go	2.0
	All right waterfall	1.0
	Hayden come on down	2.0
	Annotate tell us why	9.0
Just do one thing or	Everything	1.0
	Everything should be annotated but you need to be talking to us	1.0
	Thats why I gave you the mike	1.0
	Hold the mike up closer to mouth	1.0
I did	What you said was fine	1.0
	Just have confidence in yourself	1.0
	Youre just telling us why you thought it was important	1.0
	Thats all	1.0
So you know youre going to divide	So then should you annotate something over that	2.0
Yes	Yes	2.0
	Go	2.0
Thats all I did	Anybody have anything they would like to add to any No	2.0
	Jessie	2.0
	Come on	1.0
Because thats what theyre sharing	Anybody have anything else	8.0
	Carrie	2.0
	I like what Jessie did because when we make our number sentence thinking back to the order of division knowing what it is youre splitting is so important to put that number sentence in the right order	1.0
That was to start off	Now I want you to write your number mile	1.0
	What number mile would we have	8.0
	Well find a partner and check your answer talk with someone find another person check your answer talk with someone and then Ill be calling them to explain their thinking	1.0
	You have a couple of times to solve independently	1.0
	Check with someone talk with someone share strategies and then share out	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I havent taught a math fifthgrade lesson in quite a while so some things I do might be exactly like Ms Franklin does them	1.0
	Some things I do might be a little different but we know thats okay	1.0
	So if I do something and youre like Wait a minute	1.0
	Maybe not really different maybe Im doing that for a reason but Ms Franklin you can also say Ms Travers sometimes we do this instead and thats totally fine	1.0
	Do you usually start at your desks	1.0
	Carpet	1.0
	What do you do	1.0
	Did you have homework to go over or not	1.0
	we dont because we didnt have homework over break	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	at our desks	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	I will need you right now to have your whiteboard and marker and the other thing that you will need today do you have a math spiral	1.0
Yes	Great	1.0
	Would you please take out a spiral	1.0
	But you can take a couple of notes about that in your spiral	1.0
	There is a strategy well learn today that will help you progress	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	whiteboards and markers	1.0
	I just wanted you to have your spiral ready for when we need it	1.0
	My friends our lesson today is five one new math journal round two of math for fifthgrade year	1.0
	Heres what also is exciting	1.0
	Unit five unit six unit seven and unit eight	1.0
	Thats it your former math units in all of fifthgrade	1.0
	is that right Ms Franklin	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	It is	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Thats exciting isnt it	1.0
Yes	I would like to hear all of our if you are wearing a long sleeve shirt right now you are going to read todays lesson objective	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	Go	2.0
Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	Thats a lot of information	1.0
	I want you to think about what that is saying right now	1.0
	Think about it	1.0
	Reread it	1.0
	Think what is this asking us to do today	1.0
	Is there someone whod be willing to share your own words	8.0
	What is our learning objective today	8.0
	What is this asking us to do today	8.0
	Bobby are you willing to	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Tell us	8.0
It is saying you find denominators and multiply them but we are not multiplying the denominator but multiplying fractions	Youre close	1.0
	You found some keywords in there today	1.0
	We are going to be using a multiplication rule to help us with common denominators	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
	Because when we have fractions and we are adding and subtracting were adding and subtracting fractions today that have unlike denominators	1.0
	Is denominator top number or bottom number	8.0
Bottom	Bottom number	5.0
	In our fraction were going to say denominator for the bottom number	1.0
	Whats the name for the top number on the fraction	8.0
	Say it	2.0
Numerator	Excellent	1.0
	We already have that vocabulary	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	We will be adding and subtracting fractions today that have unlike denominators	1.0
	success criteria	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	That is on the next slide	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now short sleeves youre reading success criteria	1.0
	Are you ready	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	Go	2.0
I know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	We will use a multiplication rule to make equivalent fractions	1.0
	Well use that strategy for adding and subtracting fractions	1.0
	At the end of math today I do have a problem or two that I can have you do independently for Ms Franklin and I to check Do you have it today	1.0
	Do you have what we worked on today	1.0
	Lets start on our whiteboard	1.0
	Ms Franklin how do I get to that reading math	1.0
	you cant do that on this	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Grade five	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You got it	1.0
	Talking to somebody	1.0
	Five and one	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I dont remember somethings about	1.0
	Where do you want to go	1.0
	I would like for us to start our mental math	1.0
	You cant slide	1.0
	use a mouse	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Friends our mental math today is warming up our brain	1.0
	Your answer is going to be zero one half or one whole	1.0
	You are going to estimate whether the sums and differences are closer to zero one half or one whole	1.0
	Your answer right now will be zero one half or one whole	1.0
	Theres our first thinking problem	1.0
	If you have one half plus one eighth youre just estimating in your head	1.0
	Picture those	1.0
	Think about those	1.0
	If youre adding those fraction parts together is your answer closer to zero one half or one whole	8.0
	Starting with a half and were adding a little bit more	1.0
	That might help you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Youre going to show your answer to your face partner	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	Show	1.0
	Three two one zero voices fifthgraders	1.0
	Thats one of my strategies youll hear	1.0
	Youll hear me say Three two one and get to zero voices	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So theres a couple of seconds to finish up your conversation	1.0
	Gabe what you wrote isnt here	2.0
	Will you share your thinking that I heard you talk about	8.0
If youre adding on another eighths that would be five eighths and one and five eighths is really close to four eighths and its one eighth away from a half and its three eighths away from the whole	If you have similar thinking to Gabe please stand up	3.0
	All right	1.0
	Touch down	1.0
	Sit back down	1.0
	If you had a different thinking from Gabe please stand up	3.0
	Stay standing if youre willing to share	2.0
	Go ahead	2.0
	Will you remind me your name please	2.0
Im Jenny	Jenny	1.0
Since youre adding to one half you would round this up to one whole	Speaking of that Im seeing some hand signals	1.0
	You have some hand signals going on Ms Franklin	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So somebody is like	1.0
	Jenny will you call on someone else to add on to what you were thinking	3.0
Youre going to round it back onto one half because of the middle more	My friends very smart thinking and I love your reasoning	1.0
	I love how all of you in here did some great thinking about that problem	1.0
	Were going to do just a couple more	1.0
	Erase your boards	1.0
	Three fourths minus two thirds	1.0
	Remember your answer is zero one half or one whole	1.0
	We subtracted three fourths minus two thirds	1.0
	Will the answer be closer to zero one half or one whole	8.0
	Get some thinking ready in your brain because youre sharing with your face partner again	1.0
	This time I want the person with the shortest hair to share first	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Three two one show and share	1.0
	Three two one zero voices	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	Ive heard some great conversations up here again	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Would you be willing to share Julie	2.0
	Its Julie right	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Julie	2.0
So if you are rounding it it would almost be a whole minus a whole which we thought would be whole zero	Stand up if you have similar thinking to Julie	3.0
	Great	1.0
	Touch down	1.0
	Stand up if you have a different thinking	3.0
	Stay standing if youre willing to share	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Now Ill see your hands signal for what you were thinking about Julie	1.0
	She said closest to zero	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets check our answer here	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Thank you all for sharing your thinking	1.0
	All right	1.0
	We are going to erase our boards and do one just a little bit more challenging	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Remember we are saying is our answer closer to zero one half or one whole	1.0
	We have ninetynine hundredths plus one tenth	1.0
	Think about what	1.0
	Will your answer be closer to zero one half	8.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Get ready with your face partner again	1.0
	This time were all going to start sharing first	1.0
	Three two one	1.0
	Show and share	1.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	Zero	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I heard some great conversation up here	1.0
	Is this team bright	2.0
	Great	1.0
	Eliza would you be willing to share	2.0
	Would you mind standing up and facing your classmates this way	2.0
	There you go	1.0
	Where should your eyes be	2.0
	I just want someone in your class to share with	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
When you have one tenth it would be just a little less than one hundredth than one	Stand up if you have similar thinking with Eliza	3.0
	Stand up if you have a different thinking with Eliza	3.0
	Okay	1.0
	Touch down	1.0
	Stand up if youre unsure	3.0
	Eliza would you call on someone else to share their thinking	2.0
Thats over a whole which we decided will be closer to a whole	Both of you have strategies that the answer is closest to one whole but we have some different thinking about	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Thank you for sharing	1.0
	All right my friends	1.0
	If we look up here on the PA is closest to one whole	1.0
	Thank you for your awesome thinking	1.0
	You may erase your whiteboards	1.0
	Were going to get on with todays lesson	1.0
	Hopefully that got our brains nice and warmed up	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ms Franklin Im going to have to do some thinking and remembering about	1.0
	What do you usually use resources	1.0
	Here	1.0
	This one	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Got it	1.0
	Then you see the  the lower left	1.0
	I do	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Were on that message	1.0
	Friends Im going to have you stand up please	1.0
	Youre going to do your mathematics standing up and you just might need someone on your desks with some fraction pieces	1.0
	You are going to solve three problems and then we are going to have some team talk about the problem	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Math message	1.0
	Whoa	1.0
	Do you ever do that or do you usually read it out loud	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Lets turn it to about half of that	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Following problems	1.0
	You may use fraction circle pieces a number line or drawings to help	1.0
	When you finish talk to a partner about which problem was easiest to solve and which was the most difficult	1.0
	Be ready to discuss your reasoning	1.0
	One three fifths plus one fifth equals blank	1.0
	Two one half plus one fourth equals blank	1.0
	Three one fourth plus one third equals blank	1.0
	Hey I just want to remind you where because you also have in your math journal where in this math journal I bNoaheve is there a fraction number line that you have as a resource	1.0
	Front or back flap	1.0
	Can you check for me	1.0
Back	Because one resource instruction circles one resource that said is number line fraction circles number lines or drawings	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	My friends you can look at your fraction number lines in the back flap of your math journal	1.0
	Im going to give you about two minutes of quiet working time and I will be asking you to defend your answers with a picture a drawing using your number lines using your fraction pieces and then well have some talk time	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	We just want to start the independent thinking time	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	My friends Im sorry if I wasnt clear	1.0
	I want you to do some thinking time quietly for just a couple of minutes and then well do some talking time	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Two minutes of independence	1.0
	Thats by yourself thinking time writing time drawing time and then Ill leave you talking	1.0
	If you find the fraction circle  lacking some pieces there are some extras	1.0
	So if youre missing like blacks or greens	1.0
	Im going to make this just a little bigger for you	1.0
	Is that better	1.0
Yes	Those are your three problems	1.0
	I see you that you had an answer	1.0
	How would you prove	8.0
	Thats lovely	1.0
	Youre going to do all three	1.0
	Im going to pause can I pull up your whiteboard just for a moment	1.0
	Well this is one way you can be showing your thinking	1.0
	If you look over here friends where he has all three of his problems separated on his whiteboard	1.0
	See if you could remember your problems one two three or just divide your board into thirds	1.0
	Does anybody have an extra set of fourths because there was a bag that we need to do today	1.0
	All four of the fourths	1.0
What color	Theyre yellow	1.0
Yellow fourths	eight of them please so just one part please	1.0
	Im going to need yellow for fractions of	1.0
	Can you please show me on your fingers would zero minutes one minute or two minutes be enough time for you to show your thinking on all three problems	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were going to compromise	1.0
	One minute	1.0
	In just a couple of seconds  will be sharing number one with your shoulder partner	1.0
	If you dont have a shoulder partner then youll just have a group of three for the time being	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So would you please just share your thinking on number one the answer and how do you know or why do you think your answer is correct with your reasoning	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Shoulder partner conversation	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Just number one	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	I heard some really good conversation and I really liked one of the models that I saw one over here	1.0
	Could you please turn your eyes and ears over here toward Robin	1.0
	Robin would you stand up and show your whiteboard for us	2.0
	Do you mind	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Tell us how you did number one	1.0
	If you dont mind holding your whiteboard up you can see how she drew it with two different colors	1.0
	Tell us about your thinking Robin	9.0
First I split the circle into fifths and then I shaded in pink the three fifths and then I shaded it orange the one fifth too	Robin Im sorry to interrupt	1.0
	We cant see anything that youre talking about	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
Then I did an orange of one fifth so you could see thats two different numbers	I see how you have the pieces are the same size	1.0
	Theyre all fifths	5.0
	You have five pieces of equal fives	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So you shaded in three of them and then one of them and your total is	8.0
Four fifths	Stand up if you have similar thinking to Robin	3.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Pick up three claps	1.0
	Please	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Touch down	1.0
	The same conversation shoulder partner question number two	1.0
	Go	2.0
So what I did is I took one half and  a fourth  so then I drew it and I came up  and then I connected another one	Wow	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	One half plus one fourth	1.0
	How many fourths make up a half	8.0
Two	Okay how many fourths make up that	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Three two one and zero voices	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen again I heard some great math conversation	1.0
	Noah would you be willing to share because I saw a different strategy over here	1.0
	I saw the number line strategy rather than the fraction pieces	1.0
	Would you be willing to share	2.0
	Can I have you guys please turn your eyes and ears this way over to Noah	1.0
I did a number line strategy and	Can I switch	1.0
	Absolutely	1.0
	Wheres that white remote	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Great idea	1.0
	Thanks Ms Franklin	1.0
	This is why team teaching is so awesome	1.0
	There we go	1.0
So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer	Three fourths	2.0
	Thats what you had	2.0
	Sometimes when we stand up in front of everyone we dont always say exactly what we mean	1.0
	I want you to hear a vocabulary word that I heard Noah say	1.0
	He said he converted one half to	8.0
Three fourths	So that it is	8.0
An equivalent fraction	An equivalent fraction	4.0
	Say Equivalent fraction	2.0
Equivalent fraction	What does that mean	8.0
	What is an equivalent fraction mean	8.0
	How did you know	9.0
	Do you want to tell us a little bit more about that Noah	8.0
	Can I show a gesture because some people are naturally  to that	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	Show me	1.0
	I love it	1.0
	But how do you know theyre equal	9.0
	How do you know one half	9.0
If you have a number line youd see two fourths sits directly underneath one half so thats why you have an equal	If you look at your number line two fourths is equivalent	5.0
	Its the exact same amount of space as one half	1.0
	Good	1.0
	that	2.0
So thats not	I agree with you that the root of the equivalent is equal but how would you show it or prove it with math	8.0
	Whats your math reasoning	8.0
Fraction pieces	Fraction pieces would be another way	5.0
	Right	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	did you want to add on	3.0
Oh I couldnt	Okay	1.0
	Awesome	1.0
	Great	1.0
	My friends thank you so much	1.0
	Give Noah three claps	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Last one were going to talk about is number three	1.0
	Please talk with your shoulder partner again	2.0
	Go	2.0
You said	So 14 and 13 is looks like this	1.0
I knew	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	Zero voices	1.0
	I just love all about thinking in this classroom	1.0
	I would like lets see	1.0
	would you be willing to go up and show your drawing	8.0
	His drawing represents fraction pieces	1.0
	Would you be willing to do that	2.0
	Then Kyle would you be willing to show your strategy you used because thats what todays lesson is all about	8.0
	Would you be willing to show that next	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	My friends would you please turn your chairs turn your body so that you can see the front screen	1.0
So 14 is equivalent to 312 and because it was equivalent to 312 and then 13 was equivalent to 412 I did 312 plus 412 is 712	Stand up if you had similar thinking  Give  three claps	3.0
	I want to show you a little bit of something else	1.0
	If you were looking at the actual color fraction pieces these would be the colors and the pieces you would use 14 is the equivalent to one yellow piece 14 is equivalent to	8.0
312	312	4.0
	Three green pieces 13 one orange piece is equivalent to	8.0
412	Now that they have common denominators then you can add the numerator	1.0
	Correct	2.0
	Now we have 312 plus 412 is 712	1.0
	Did you want to add something	2.0
	I saw your hand	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I love when this happens when a student in the class sees the next math opportunity before we even teach it	1.0
	I think some of you out there did that	1.0
	I just happen to walk by Julie and I saw	1.0
	She is going to show you what we call the multiplication rule for finding common denominators	1.0
	This is something thats going to help you for the rest of math this whole year and your life	1.0
	So take out your math spiral	1.0
	I would write this in there	1.0
	Were going to show that problem with the multiplication rule	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Come on down Julie	2.0
	My friends I want you to do is have your spiral next to you and your pencil ready to write down what were calling the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So if this was me and I was taking math notes right now I would write multiplication rule	1.0
	You are not sure how shes going to put that	1.0
	For finding equivalent fractions	1.0
	Do you need this Ms Franklin	1.0
	No	1.0
	You can erase it if you want	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You got it	1.0
	We are starting with 14 plus 13 is that right Julie	2.0
That will be 712	Youre using the multiplication strategy to help you get common denominators	2.0
Uhhuh	The multiplication strategy gets you two equivalent fractions so that then you can add the numerators	1.0
So thats what I did to	So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator	9.0
Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator	So if I multiply the denominator by the other denominator and then whatever you multiply the denominator by you also need to multiply the	8.0
Numerator	numerator by and thats how you can get an equivalent fraction	5.0
	What Im hearing Julie say is were going to do 14  3	1.0
	So Im going to rewrite that like this	1.0
	14  4 times this denominator	1.0
	We have 4  3  12 and 1  3 equals	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	So what I know now is 14 is equivalent to 312	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	How would you do it this one	8.0
	It is one	1.0
	Then what would we do to 13	8.0
	What would we multiply 13 times	8.0
	Show her	1.0
	You can do it on your	1.0
	times say it Katie	1.0
One fourth	Times 44 which equals one	1.0
	What would we get	8.0
	Four twelves	1.0
	Now I have a new problem 312  412 equals what	8.0
	What did you guys get	8.0
712	Thats what we call the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions and well do a couple more before you do it on your own	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets give Julie a round of applause	1.0
	Thank you my dear	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So friends weve been sitting for a while	1.0
	Its time for a mix and mingle	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Its okay	1.0
	Were going to take it step by step	1.0
	Go ahead and take your math spiral and your pencil and stand up please	1.0
	You know what	1.0
	Im going to change my thinking because I think if we do a couple of the problems in the journal then we will be more on track	1.0
	Your math spiral might help you but also grab your new math journal and please turn to Page 154	1.0
	Ms Franklin that would be on my screen on practice on the factors	1.0
	Math message	1.0
Just look into the second page	There we go	1.0
	That was a good guess Mrs	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	My friends would you turn to this page 154	1.0
	Its not weird the first page in your journal is 154	1.0
	I always think thats funny when youre in the new version	1.0
No its 153	Its what	1.0
No its 153	Turn to Page 154 for me please	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Here were going to try the multiplication rule for equivalent fractions	1.0
	My friends youre seeing 12	1.0
	Were going to use the multiplication rule to multiply	1.0
	If we are multiplying the denominator by two youre going to multiply 1  2 is 2 and 2  4 is 4	1.0
	You will have a new equivalent fraction	1.0
	12 is equivalent to 24	1.0
	Theres like a little saying I like to tell	1.0
	Say it	1.0
	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	1.0
	Everybody say it with me	2.0
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Say it with a Southern drawl	2.0
Okay	Lets talk through how will we do 12  3	1.0
	Can you write on this	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You just have to erase with that blue  thats sitting on the corner of my desk	1.0
	You want me to use this or the kit	1.0
	I could use that	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	I just do	1.0
	We would do 12  3	1.0
	Talk me through it Kenley	1.0
	You know what	2.0
	Alice is here	1.0
	Kenley is here	1.0
	Alice Kenley Yes	2.0
	Alice	2.0
So then your new fraction is 36	What is 33 equivalent to	8.0
	Show me	8.0
	One whole	2.0
	Are you making that number bigger by multiplying it by one	2.0
No	Youre renaming it	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	I dont mean to step on you	1.0
	No	1.0
	I appreciate I think its so awesome to have two people teaching at the same time without thinking about much is it	1.0
	Right	1.0
	How about our five	8.0
	12  5 what would that look like	8.0
	I would say someone want to talk me through this one	8.0
	Yes Eliza	2.0
Three times five it would be two times five would be 10 and then you would say	Well do one times five first which is inside	5.0
	Were youre blue bag	1.0
	Thank you my dear	1.0
	I like the way I see people filling in their math drills as we go through these examples	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Because thats the numerator	1.0
	Right	1.0
Which would be five and then two times five will be 10 which you would get 510	This would be	8.0
Five tenths	Now this is what Im seeing in the classroom	1.0
	Teachers love this	1.0
	Some kids are like Yes	1.0
	Ive got this	1.0
	Some kids are like I am stuck	1.0
	So heres what were going to do	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were going to do mix and mingle for the two bits on the bottom	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You have another fraction box and we are going to actually do it with our mix and mingle partner	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So stand up with your math journal and your pencil please	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You are right here now on this 25 box and youre going to mix	1.0
	Go	1.0
Mingle	Who thinks the timer is amazing	1.0
	Ms Travers was really prepared	1.0
	High five the person closest to you	1.0
	If you dont have a partner walk toward the carpet please	1.0
	If someone is walking towards the carpet invite them to join your group please and here we go	1.0
	Would you please use equivalent fractions to find common denominators for 25	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Two fifths	Friends lets do the two fifths the whole lot the two the three multiplied by the two the three and the five	1.0
Miss Herd I figured out	Did you	2.0
Uhhuh	Down below	2.0
Can we answer that	In just a minute	1.0
	Are you ready to	2.0
Yes	and then Im going to say Go	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	My friends wrap up your conversation with your partner	1.0
	Stand and up and thank this partner	2.0
Thank you partner	Now were going to do another strategy thatTlikes a lot	1.0
	Pairscompare	1.0
	Join so that you have two with another two	1.0
	So now you will have four pairscompare right now so youre having four together	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Check your answers again with a new partnership	3.0
	Go	2.0
	See if you have the same thing	3.0
Then 2  5 is 10	Ladies and gentlemen please thank your new partner and youre going to do one more mix and mingle	1.0
	Go	1.0
Mingle	High Five to the person closest to you but it needs to be someone you have not already been partners with today	1.0
	So if youre with someone youve already been partners with you need to go find another partner please	1.0
	Wave if you need someone	1.0
	Awesome	1.0
	Walk toward the carpet if you do need a partner and join another group	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Freeze please	1.0
	Your next question	1.0
	Oh wait	1.0
	So everybody has zero a voice for me	1.0
	Your next question is this	1.0
	What do you notice about the fractions in the gray shaded boxes	8.0
	I want you to think first	1.0
	What do you notice about the fractions in the gray shaded boxes	8.0
	Talk to this partner about what you noticed and write down your thinking	2.0
	Go	2.0
It has to be	Thats something to do with multiplication rule	2.0
Yes	intention in line	1.0
	What are we thinking about for our learning intention today	8.0
The second number we multiplied was both two times five like this	Theres the vocabulary from	1.0
	All right	1.0
	turn the screen back to todays learning and  Today were using equivalent fractions to finding common denominator to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a	8.0
Multiplication rule	Okay	1.0
	So what we are going to do is I want you to take another couple seconds to finish your thinking and jot down your answer	1.0
	When I come back and check our thinking on	8.0
	What do you notice about the fractions at the gray shaded boxes at our teams in just a moment	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Think about it now	1.0
	They were the same	1.0
	Please thank this partner and head back to your seats	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Please bring your conversation to a close	1.0
	I want to show you something I saw in most kids journals	1.0
	I saw this but what Im really curious about is what you have written on your line	1.0
	What do we notice about the factions in the gray shaded boxes	8.0
	Faith will you share with us your thinking  please	8.0
Also the numerator is 110 of the difference from	Thank you for starting us up	1.0
	Would you call on someone else please	2.0
Me and my partner said is that  the denominator is 10 and the first one is 510 and the second one is 410 so theres a 110 difference too	Anything you would add with that Ms Franklin	1.0
	I like their use of vocabulary	1.0
	I sure do too the use of vocabulary	1.0
	Now that we have that my friends thats going to help us with our next step is doing the actual adding and subtracting of fractions	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to flip back over here because sometimes I think it is helpful to just see how someone else worded it	1.0
	They have common denominator of 10	1.0
	25 is equivalent to 410	1.0
	12 is equivalent to 510	1.0
	Now that you have that my friends can you now that you have common denominators can we add	2.0
Yes	Lets do it	1.0
	Ready	2.0
Lets do this	Pencils ready	1.0
	I would like you to please solve number one A and B and C and then we will talk again	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Think to yourself what is 12 equivalent to what is 25 equivalent to	1.0
	Notice how to use the chart because youve already	1.0
	Youve already done it	1.0
	12 is equivalent to	8.0
	Use the gray boxes	1.0
	Hint	1.0
	Hint	1.0
	Use the two fractions in the gray boxes	1.0
	Thats why theyre gray	1.0
	this is 12 and 25 so here is 12 times	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	you did multiply  so there is 12 minus 25	1.0
	My friends a couple of things I just noticed is remembering for us to think about what is 12 equal to	8.0
	12 is equal to	8.0
510	510	4.0
	We use the multiplication rule	1.0
	This 12 is the same amount as 510 and then this 25 its the same amount as	8.0
410	410	4.0
	This is what youre adding	1.0
	You should not need your fraction toolkit	1.0
	Youve got this	1.0
	This is what you need	1.0
	This is what you need right here	1.0
	We already did the hard work up here in our chart	1.0
	We know that 12 is equivalent to 510 and 25 is equivalent to 410	1.0
	Now that we have that we can solve	1.0
	510  410 fifth graders what is it	8.0
910	Answer right here is	8.0
910	Great	1.0
	Now we do subtraction	1.0
	Whats 12 equivalent	8.0
510	Whats 25 equivalent to	8.0
410	What is 510  410	8.0
110	Youre brilliant	1.0
	We did the hard work up here	1.0
	We did the multiplication rule up here in the chart	1.0
	We use that information	1.0
	After you have equivalent fractions then you can add and subtract	1.0
	So my friends what is greater 12 or 25	8.0
12	Got it	1.0
	If you are feNoahng likeTand Ms Franklin I am like I got this	1.0
	I can keep going on my own	1.0
	You will have about five minutes on your own	1.0
	No because were going to the library so well have to come back and finish	1.0
	If you are needing a help then well do about five minutes of some help time after	1.0
	So stop and think right now	1.0
	Oh sorry	1.0
	this is you	1.0
	No please	1.0
	Finish	1.0
	Reerase	1.0
	I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	1.0
	How are you feNoahng about being able to do that at this point	2.0
	We know you need more practice but how are you feNoahng right now	2.0
	Well come back and finish practicing	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What do we say to Ms Travers	2.0
Thank you Ms Travers	Thank you for having me in your classroom today	1.0
	So we have one team that theyre confused about their homework	1.0
	They would like to come for a group with it	1.0
	Do we have somebody thats feCharlieng confident about their homework to give us and explain their thinking for us	2.0
	Wow nobody is feCharlieng confident	2.0
	I know we had a substitute yesterday but I know Angel said some things contently weve been interacting with	1.0
	Yes its okay	1.0
	Yes there you go thank you	1.0
	Lots of volunteers now	1.0
	Marvin can you come up and show yours please	8.0
	Give a round of applause for our volunteer	1.0
	Were watching to see what his thinking is were not working in our math journals or that ladies	1.0
Then I kept the Yaxis coordinate the same	Because	9.0
Because were not going to make it tSSer were just going to make it wider	Shelby and you dont like this why	3.0
I think its in double both numbers in here	Lots of people are not agreeing with you	1.0
	Pick somebody thats not agreeing with you to respond to you	2.0
I just thought we had to make it bigger	Can you go back to the prompt to help us see that	2.0
	Read that for us Marvin	2.0
Her brother said she could change her picture to make it look like a real house	What should the picture look like	8.0
	What are the keywords there	8.0
	Everybody look and see what are the keywords to help you see how to modify this	8.0
	I like the way people are looking at their work on the board or theyre looking at their own homework	1.0
	What are the keys to tell you how to modify this	8.0
	Share with your shoulder partner	2.0
	Partner A shares their thinking	2.0
	What are the keywords here River	8.0
Twice as wide as it is high	What does that mean	8.0
	Keep the height the same and make it twice as wide	1.0
	Do we agree with that	2.0
	SS right and so any other questions about this	2.0
	Team four do you get it now	2.0
Yes	Rylee whats still confusing you	2.0
I just dont know how I got done	Because Marvin is right there	1.0
	You what	2.0
I just dont get	What could we ask Rylee to help him understand this	8.0
	Does it have to be just related to todays homework to help him understand this	3.0
	Think about any of the lessons weve been doing what could we ask him about that would help him understand this	3.0
	Stormy	1.0
	Which axis would you multiply to make it wider	3.0
Xaxis	What do you think	3.0
	Do you agree with this answer	3.0
	Let me know	1.0
	There is your feedback Rylee	1.0
	Thats the one that you want to make twice as big as the original	1.0
	Thats just what Marvin did SS right	2.0
	A round of applause	1.0
	Id like you to please leave your paper where its at and join me on the front	1.0
	Thanks for getting here quickly	1.0
	This was the problem that you were doing yesterday	1.0
	This is the problem art he wants to make a picture on his reading folder and he wants it to look still like this booklet	1.0
	He wants to make it larger so that its not more noticeable on his notebook	1.0
	You guys remember that	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Where are my handydandy	1.0
Book	What do you think a good response would include to this problem	8.0
	What would you need to do in order to have a good response to this	8.0
	Now Im just going to jot down your ideas on a sticky note that we can throw under here	1.0
	What would a good response include	8.0
	This was one of the questions	1.0
	Lets read it together	2.0
Write a rule that Justly can use to make the picture of the book larger	Read this question	2.0
Be specific about how you think the book will change	Thinking about those two questions what would we be looking for in an answer	8.0
	Need your elbow partner	1.0
	Raise your hand if you dont have an elbow partner	2.0
	So then Makou will be Rebecca partner	1.0
	There your partner can just come up and talk with Stevie	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Talk with your partner what are we looking for in order to have a good answer for this response so far	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	What will the response include so far	8.0
	Ready Ansley	2.0
You have to answer any questions	Can you talk about question one first so that we can go in order please	2.0
We cant just say double the coordinates like you would end up doubling the Yaxis or Xaxis	Okay so a specific rule to make the picture	2.0
Yes	Anybody want to give any feedback on that	3.0
	Are you agreeing	3.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What about number two what are we looking for there	8.0
Charlie	What youre looking for there is what you think the book actuSSy look like and how you think the book will change	4.0
	So describe the picture and it says Be specific about how you think the book will change what do you mean by that	8.0
These details about how you think the book will change	What do you think of that	3.0
	Anything else people want to add for either one of those	3.0
	Im just jotting them down on the sticky notes so we can Asterluate some work together	1.0
	I guess I should be putting this on the chart because its going to be hard to see it when we are looking at work	1.0
	I will have to try to splitscreen but well see	1.0
	Lets go to this next part what do you need to do in order to make the prompt for this component	8.0
	Talk with your elbow partner	2.0
	Okay Hunter what needs to be on here in order to make the prompt	8.0
You have to	What are those items in between the parenthesis cSSed again	8.0
Coordinates	Yes the ordered pairs of coordinates	5.0
	What would we be looking for	8.0
	Help him out partner	3.0
Double the first one there	Do they have to be doubled	2.0
	They just have to be larger according to the prompt so the coordinates are accurate and make the picture larger	1.0
	It doesnt have to be double they just have to be larger	1.0
	They need to be accurate and larger	1.0
	Anything else that people think for this	8.0
	Milan	2.0
You have to remember to write the parenthesis and the comma	Okay so parenthesis and comma for the ordered pair	5.0
	Phyl	2.0
ActuSSy make it follow your rule like two times the original	Okay follows the rule that you wrote nice thank you	1.0
	Anything else	2.0
	Charlie	2.0
How many plotted lines are there	First of SS this is use your rule so write the new coordinates so lets just stay there	1.0
	Now go on to the next part read number four	2.0
Connect the points in the same order that you plot them	Stop and think what are you looking for in order for it to be a good answer to the problems	8.0
	Sutton	2.0
You need to make sure that connect the points in the same order	What do you think	3.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What else	8.0
	Isabel	2.0
	If these are the coordinates here when I plot them whats important to make sure happens	8.0
That they go in order	Okay thats true youre going to do them in that order	1.0
	What else are you going to do about these coordinates to make sure that they are following your rule	8.0
	Plot the coordinates for the new book	1.0
Make it more tSSer	They actuSSy make it larger	1.0
	What else though	8.0
	Talk with your partners what else are we looking for when they plot these coordinates	8.0
	Hey back to me	1.0
	Sandra what are we looking for about them plotting the coordinates	8.0
We need to make sure that the coordinates	I hear you saying we need to make sure that theyre plotted correctly and accurately would that be the same	2.0
	Theyre plotted correctly and accurately what did you want	8.0
	to add	1.0
Make sure youre plotting them based on the rule	Yes based on what youve written	5.0
	SS right what do you think Im thinking	8.0
	You guys are slow here today give me feedback so we can move along thank you	1.0
	Number five read it	2.0
How was your prediction incorrect	What would you need to do in order to be proficient with this	8.0
	Claud	2.0
Compare your predictions with problem two	Yes actuSSy answer these two questions	5.0
	When you answer these questions what would make them good answers	8.0
	Talk with your elbow partner about that please	2.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Leslie thank you	1.0
	What would we be looking for for your answers to these questions	8.0
You would be looking for to check if your plots matched the actual	I think thats another question I agree that youre going to do that but thats a different question	1.0
	How are your answers to these questions going to be good answers	8.0
	What are we looking for for a good answer of how your prediction was correct how was your prediction incorrect	8.0
	What are we going to do that make sure that those answers are clear to our reader	8.0
To compare them	Okay actuSSy answering the question yes	1.0
	What are we looking for	8.0
	You actuSSy answer the questions but what are we looking for that helps us answer the questions correctly	8.0
	What are we going to use that helps us be clear to our reader	8.0
Reasoning	Our reasoning good	5.0
	What else	8.0
	Help her out find somebody thats showing you this to help you out	3.0
	Charlie	2.0
I like your thinking and I think you could use details of the instruction and complete sentences	Okay so detailed	1.0
	How can we be detailed	8.0
	What helps us be detailed	8.0
	Stevie	2.0
Because youre already more proficient and now youre improficient and explain how you are	What Im looking for here is math vocabulary	1.0
	Youre using words like Xcoordinate Ycoordinate ordered pairs so the math vocabulary	1.0
	You guys are on the right track youre just not stating it as clear as I would like	1.0
	Make sure youre using math vocabulary	1.0
So restating the prompt	Yes restating the prompt	5.0
	How my prediction was correct is good	1.0
	SS right so now weve got a list what were you looking for or good answers here	8.0
	Lets look at some work	1.0
	Where is it	1.0
	Heres someones actual work and I already see some people questioning some things	1.0
	No	1.0
	Talk with your elbow partner what did you notice about this part	8.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Dylan what observations did you and your partner have about this work	8.0
the exact same size or smSSer and why do we need it because unless youre closer to that	Okay but if you look back at the prompt it didnt say where it needs to be it just said he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder so is it breaking the rule to have it there	2.0
No	No so yes looks like its the same size I agree its supposed to be larger	5.0
	What would you like to add Milan	3.0
I was going to say that if you send that	Im sorry it was Vanessa that still had her hand up	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
When youre timesing your coordinates you have to plot it according to the coordinates that you plot on your grid you cant have it floating in the air because that not possible because one of your coordinates	Okay so I want to ask you is if somethings larger but in a different location does that mean that it doesnt fit the rule that they ask for	2.0
	Lets go back to that original question	1.0
	I think its over here	1.0
	No its over here	1.0
	No its right here	1.0
	After drawing the picture Justly decides he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder	1.0
	Does it say that it has to start on these same coordinates in order to be larger	2.0
No	No	4.0
It could be on any point	It could be on any coordinates as long as its larger	1.0
I know but how can they be tiny multiplying the coordinates and still have it like if you were timesing one of the coordinates	Multiplying	4.0
I get how it would be larger but I dont know how itd be	Thats a great question	1.0
	Everybody think about it	1.0
	Everybody think about how could you make this bigger but change the location	8.0
	How can you make this larger lets even just say twice as large just for arguments sake how can you make this twice as large but put it in a different location	8.0
	Talk with your elbow partner about your idea	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay back to me please	1.0
	Kirby what did you and your partner decide	8.0
We decided it doesnt matter wherever it is when youre following the instructions telling you what to do	Okay good youre on the right track but how could I move that and make it twice as large	8.0
	Like this right here from here to here is how many sections wide so far	1.0
	From here to here how many sections are they showing	8.0
	Its one so we want it to be how many sections wide	8.0
	Two but where will we put it then	8.0
	We know that its going to have to be two sections wide so can you make this larger but just put it at different coordinates	2.0
Yes	Milan	2.0
	Im sorry Vanessa	1.0
If you multiply zero by anything its always going to be zero	Okay but Sandra respond to her	3.0
If you add instead of multiplying if you change your rule to adding adding something to zero will make it one or two or three or four so you could move it instead of making it bigger	This needs it in terms of getting larger or its not even larger	1.0
No	The fact that its in a different location does that change this persons work	2.0
	No	1.0
	The part that doesnt work is that they kept it the same	1.0
	SS they did was move its location in the coordinate plane so thats not meeting the objective	1.0
	I heard somebody saying the dots are too big	1.0
	Does it matter what size	2.0
No	No theyre definitely on the coordinate they just are emphasized	5.0
	The problem is its not twice as large	1.0
	SS right lets look at the next one	1.0
	Lets read this	2.0
	This was where you read a rule Justly used to make the picture that was larger	1.0
	Read the rule with me	2.0
Justly can multiply the Xcoordinate by six	Okay I think my contact might be in bathroom six	1.0
	The tunnel looks like a pipe too	1.0
Yes	Look and see	1.0
	Did this person make it larger	2.0
Yes	I see some people that I missed	1.0
	Ryan	2.0
He did make it larger but if he was going to only multiply the Xcoordinate that would only make it wider and not forward	He meant to say what	8.0
Multiply the X and Y axis by six	So he wasnt as detailed as he should be right	2.0
	Lets look at this next one	1.0
	Describe what you think the new picture will look like	8.0
	Be specific about how you think the folder will change	1.0
	The folder will be	8.0
	Read it with me	2.0
The folder will be tSSer	Is it just tSSer	2.0
Wider	Its tSSer and wider yes	5.0
	Lets look now at this rule	1.0
	Looks like he multiplied it by six right	2.0
Yes	Thats five six	1.0
	Yes he multiplied both coordinates by six so he was not specific up here	1.0
	Those two things hes a little confused but this part he actuSSy made the coordinates following a different rule to what he wrote so would he be proficient	2.0
No	No but he did reSSy make me work	5.0
	Lets look at this one	1.0
	Talk with your elbow partner what you notice about the	8.0
	Lets hear one of your observations Isabel	8.0
Its tSSer and not wider	Did it have to be tSSer and wider	2.0
No	No it just had to be larger so would you say that this is larger	2.0
Yes	Yes so that would work	5.0
	What else did you notice Brendan	8.0
Hes not reSSy explaining how his prediction is correct	I see a lot of people agreeing with you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lastly there should be one more observation	1.0
	Whats the other observation Leslie	8.0
The other observation was that well its good overSS but they could	Tune here Leslie right here	1.0
They just said how it was correct	I see a lot of people nodding their heads thumbs up	1.0
	Yes you need to make sure you address that	1.0
	If there was nothing incorrect you still say that	5.0
	Based on my prediction it came out the way I expected	1.0
	I didnt see anything that was different so that you at least address the answer to the question	1.0
	I get what Im looking for	1.0
	I have questions about it	1.0
	Today Ill flip	1.0
	Nice I pushed the wrong button sorry	1.0
	Im out of practice being gone one day and look what happens	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	Lets go back to the learning intention here	1.0
	I can discuss other Ss roles and pictures on the coordinate grid and revise my work	1.0
	Remember the word revise means to relook at something and make changes	1.0
	Where else do you use revision in your life	8.0
	Do you think you can think of some other ways that we look at something and make changes	8.0
	If you always talk first you talk second	1.0
	Talk with your partner how did you revise your work	8.0
	Get back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Asher where else do you use revision in your life	8.0
I use revision when Im writing to revise if I make a mistake in my wording or if I just make a mistake	I see a lot of people agreeing with you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Kerry whats another way you use revision in your life	8.0
When you give me high scores and maybe youre just trying something new like in one of those sports you said if youre trying because first you get it wrong and then eventuSSy you get it right	I love your thinking	1.0
	I love your example	1.0
	Coachable people definitely use revision in their sports	1.0
	Definitely	1.0
	Josiah whats another example	8.0
	What did you and your partner talk about	8.0
If you see something wrong you could erase it or make changes to it	Great example	1.0
	Anybody has one that wasnt mentioned that theyd like to share	8.0
	Alison	2.0
Make it right	Thank you	1.0
	Whats another example Carolyn	8.0
I ll say buying from the grocery store and you have the grocery store list and you just ran out of a certain item and you forgot to put on the list you revise the rest after youve done that	Thank you	1.0
	Great examples	1.0
	I think weve got this concept of revision	1.0
	Revision means to relook at it and make some changes	1.0
	Today for success criteria lets read this together	2.0
You need to understand others thinking to get answers to the questions harder at work make revisions see past lists of what other response would include	I jotted down here smart thinking from our lesson I will magnify it just to make sure you can read what Ive written here so good response	1.0
	Reads with me	2.0
Beside the picture details about picture looks coordinate accurate for larger	You guys said they need to have parentheses and commas	1.0
Answer the questions	Youre going to have two answers Leslie	1.0
Restate the problems reasoning detail and the amount of	Can you guys see that if I leave that up there to check your work today so you can make your revisions	1.0
	Hows this	1.0
	Is that too bad	1.0
	What if I do it this way	1.0
	Is that better	1.0
	Like this	1.0
Yes	Or a little smSSer	1.0
Yes	Like this	1.0
	If you need to come up here to look at this feel free to	1.0
	Theres one paper without a name so if you dont get your paper back its yours	1.0
	When youre finished working today revising your work go ahead and go to your paper from knock boxes and thats journal pages that you were given yesterday please	1.0
	I dont get what to do I have questions	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Remembering you re using a different writing material so I can see the difference between your original work and your revised work	1.0
	Is that yours or not	1.0
	Or is it Blakely	1.0
	Ive passed every paper I had back so if you dont have yours look for it because they were not turned in then	1.0
	Theres this  paper	1.0
	Put some of the  writing like this	1.0
	that want to group come and get a copy because theres three of them	1.0
	Just come get paper here	1.0
	Theres three papers	1.0
	Im pretty sure this is it	1.0
	Theres three papers	1.0
	Theres the	1.0
	Just get what you need	1.0
	Theres this paper	1.0
	This one has	1.0
	No like this	1.0
	Do you see how	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Did you guys turn in your work yesterday like you usuSSy do in class where the team leader turns them SS in or did you walk over and independently turned it in	1.0
Independently turned in	Why are you breaking the rules when Im not here	1.0
	Because now someones paper is missing	1.0
	This is  and not collect any work from people and now someone is missing their work	1.0
	Should you follow the way we do things even if Im not here	1.0
Yes	Ask yourself is your work getting accomplished	2.0
Oh my God	Thank you	1.0
	please stand	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	intention in  we were supposed to be able to discuss other Ss their roles their pictures to help you revise your work	1.0
	You will be looking at it so that you can make improvements or changes	1.0
	You had to be able to understand other peoples thinking	1.0
	Were looking for clear answers to the questions	1.0
On your work	Pack your work that you made revisions and you were using this list that we  created in order to help you make those revisions	1.0
	How well did you make the learning intention today	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Please make sure that team leaders get the work turned in	1.0
	If you are not finished consider it homework	1.0
	I had several people that were finished with math box and math journal work	1.0
	If you would please stack your math journal over here	1.0
	This should  for me so I can start working on	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	join me on the	1.0
	All right	1.0
	The next problem My other questions how much money is in his savings account after eight driveways	8.0
	Paige	2.0
	200 after eight driveways	5.0
	There you go	1.0
	All right heres your next problem	1.0
Look like a lot of you are like Im not really sure or not what to do after I  my equation	Make your table set it up  five minutes 5 10 15 20	1.0
	Or do your recommended 10 minutes its your choice to ake up to your increments	1.0
	I know that when Im on an elliptical people work out likeone minute and like Okay Im done	1.0
	No you need to think about that	1.0
Look at all those chickens	All right	1.0
	Lets see  two one	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What are my two variables in this problem	8.0
	Theyre my independent and dependent variables in this problem	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What are my two variables in this problem	8.0
	Theyre my independent and dependent variables in this problem	1.0
	Terry	2.0
Variables RC for calories and M for minutes	Okay so which is independent which is dependent	8.0
Dependent is calories and independent is minutes	It will be total calories	5.0
You could even be more specific and say total calories burned	The total calories you burn depends on	8.0
How many minutes you workout	Minutes you workout	4.0
	Its minutes you workout on the like we could say minutes on the elliptical	1.0
Is the elliptical device thing	Yes	1.0
	Hey Shh	1.0
	Please stop	1.0
	All right what is our equation	8.0
	Byron	2.0
20010M T	She says T for total we can say C for calories	1.0
	You were correct	1.0
	What does this 200 represent	8.0
	Byron	2.0
It represents the 200 calories you burned when you weightlifted	This person weightlifted and burned 200 calories	5.0
	That is already there that is our constant	1.0
	That 200 calories is there	1.0
	Now the person is going to workout on the elliptical so theyre going to burn 10 calories per minute more to get our total	1.0
	We have the constant 200 and then its going to change	1.0
	Now if you created a table so if your table is here and you have your independent variable your X which is your minutes lets do it 10 minutes Actually first of all Im going to start with zero minutes	1.0
	If I start with zero minutes on the elliptical how many calories have I burned	8.0
	Roland	2.0
	200 if I substitute zero in for M 20010x00	5.0
	2000200	1.0
	Now if I work out for 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 40 50 Im just going to do by my tens	1.0
	If I workout for 10 minutes how many calories have I burned	8.0
	Substitute a 10 in for M Reed	2.0
300	It would be 20010x10 10x10100 so that would be 300	5.0
	However if I workout for 20 minutes how many calories is it	8.0
	Isabelle	2.0
500	If I substitute 20010x substitute 20 in 10x20200	1.0
	Whats 200200	8.0
		4.0
	If I workout for 30 minutes	8.0
	Raphael	2.0
	What is it increasing by every time now	8.0
By 100		4.0
	Originally please stop humming	1.0
	Originally we start with our 200 and then from there its going to be 100 every single time	1.0
	How many of you drew a graph	2.0
	It says to draw a graph right	2.0
	Graph the equation	1.0
	Some of you have not done so lets do a graph now	1.0
	Youre making a graph please	1.0
	You were graphing this	1.0
	If youd like to use a graph paper  that was helpful	1.0
No no you dont	You have a graph drawn	2.0
	Go ahead hurry up	1.0
	If you drew the graph you were looking at your two columns	1.0
	This column I started with zero	1.0
	This is my X so Im going up by 10 every time	1.0
	10 20 30 40 so when I drew mine 10 20 30 40 50 60 went up by 10	1.0
	I should also label it	1.0
	What is the Xaxis representing	8.0
Time	Minutes worked	8.0
Minutes workedout	Minutes on the elliptical	1.0
	You cant just put minutes	1.0
	What does the Yaxis represent	8.0
	Reed	2.0
Calories burned on the elliptical	Yes so no thats total calories	5.0
	On my Yaxis I go zero 100 200 300 400 500 600	1.0
	I am doing these by 100	1.0
	Now If Im wondering how some of you started this	1.0
	If you started here like at 200 then that means your next one would have to be 400	1.0
	You have to think about your scale factor	1.0
	Im looking at this and I know that its increased by 100 every time	1.0
	My original jump was at 200	1.0
	My first plot my first dot should be at 0 200 So I should go over zero and up to 200 This is where Im starting Ive already burned calories	1.0
	Brett Im not sure what youre doing	1.0
That bathroom light is off	Looking at my table then when I go over 10 I should go up to 300	1.0
	Over 10 up to 300	1.0
		1.0
	Every time Im increasing by 10 minutes Im increasing by 100	1.0
	Your graph should look like this	1.0
	It starts here because youve already burned 200 calories before you start	1.0
	It should not start down here	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes	My graph starts at 200 0 minutes on the elliptical and weve already burned 200 calories because I already lifted weights	1.0
	Then my graph will start to grow from there	1.0
	We are going to do a quick brain break so stand up	1.0
	With your right hand and do not look	1.0
	Your left hand	1.0
	Switch	1.0
	You started seeing what	1.0
	thumbs up  switch	1.0
	Switch	1.0
It wont work	Return back to your seats	1.0
	I am going to regroup you again	1.0
	I like that I see some groups making a table first	1.0
	Identifying independent and dependent variables and then making a graph	1.0
	All right lets talk  A train averages 40 miles per hour between two cities	1.0
	What are our independent and dependent variables in this one	8.0
	What depends on what	8.0
Speed depends on time	All these problems you need to identify independent and dependent	1.0
	Jeremy	2.0
Miles per hour is dependent	Its not miles per hour	5.0
	Its miles what	8.0
	Youre not finding the miles per hour	1.0
	We know its 40 miles per hour	1.0
	Its miles what	8.0
Distance	What	2.0
	I heard it here	1.0
	Somebody whispered it	1.0
It was him	Miles what	8.0
Im right next to you	Gage miles what	8.0
	Miles traveled total	1.0
	Miles per hour is not the same thing as miles traveled total	1.0
	Miles per hour is if youre going 40 miles per hour	1.0
	Miles per hour is for whatMiles traveled in total is over a timeframe	1.0
	Maybe we use the variable M This depends on what	8.0
	Whats our independent variable	8.0
Hours	Hours	4.0
	variable each	1.0
	What is your equation for this	8.0
	Jeremy you probably have an equation	8.0
No	No	2.0
	Who has got an equation for me	8.0
	Porter	2.0
40M	40   total miles  hours	5.0
Yes	40 miles   the number of miles  hours	1.0
	40 miles per hour means 40   hours  the total miles	1.0
	Its 40	1.0
	Your graph should look something You should have a table	1.0
	Your table should be 140 280 3120	1.0
	Here is what your graph would look like	1.0
	What do we need to add to this graph though	8.0
	What should we add to this graph Martin	8.0
You could add the X and Y to show that its like the Y is going up and the X is over there	Okay what else could I add and I need to add though	8.0
	Nash	2.0
The labels	We need to label them	5.0
	What is this one down here	8.0
Hours traveled	This is hours	8.0
Hours traveled	traveled	4.0
	What is this one	8.0
	Reed	2.0
Id have the Miles traveled	Miles traveled total	5.0
	I also would like you to put a title on the top of it	1.0
	Here in the seventhgrade youve got to put a title on the top of your graph	1.0
	What is this whole graph showing us	8.0
Distance between two cities	Distance between two cities	4.0
	Reed	2.0
How long did you take to get between the two cities	I would say train traveling time or something maybe	1.0
Distance between two cities	At least you need to have your X and your Y graph labeled	1.0
	Do not forget that	1.0
	If you just give me a graph without those Lorna Im going to marsh you up or something	1.0
	If you a graph without your X and Y labeled youve a bunch of numbers that mean nothing to me	1.0
	Like on this one if I just had these numbers here that doesnt tell me anything	1.0
	I just know that they got 10 20 I got  but I dont know what it represents	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes	Great	1.0
	What time is it	1.0
	Its too late	1.0
	Well have to do it tomorrow	1.0
	You guys are supposed to remind me	1.0
We have eight minutes though	Yes but we have	1.0
No please	All right for math today our learning target is the lesson is area models for fraction multiplication	1.0
	So I can use area models to find fraction products	1.0
	What does product mean in math Olivia	8.0
Answer to a multiplication	Answer to a multiplication problem	5.0
	So I know I understand this when I can draw a large square divide it horizontally by one denominator and vertically by the other denominator	1.0
	Okay we did that yesterday	1.0
	Shade the parts of the square for each fraction and show the part that is shaded by both fractions and write a number sentence that shows the area model	1.0
So basically what we did yesterday	It is similar we may have to look at some tips	1.0
	Oh whoops or a nine	1.0
	That was yesterdays	1.0
Yes we did 57 so	Yes thats right	1.0
	23 of 23 So if we were to do that like we did yesterday so lets just draw	1.0
	Ill have somebody come up	1.0
	We need two different colors	1.0
	Lets start with just a black box	1.0
	Somebody come and show me 23	8.0
	Laim	2.0
Do you want me to	No I just want you to do 23 so you are just drawing one of them	8.0
	So Laim is deciding to do his vertically	1.0
	Emma are you paying attention do I need to move you two so youre not so close	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Do we agree or disagree with what Laim put up here for 23	3.0
I agree	Okay	1.0
	So can I have somebody come draw another 23 in a different way	3.0
	Oliver you want to try it	2.0
Sure	Lets pick a different color	1.0
Just like	We did this yesterday you werent here yesterday but this shows us 23 of 23	1.0
	When we have two colors and they have xs that tells us the answer	1.0
	So Elijah what is the answer of 23 of 23	8.0
Im still confused a little	Okay	1.0
	Who can	2.0
	Sophia	2.0
46	So we have 1234 that have both red and blue in them	1.0
	So thats our numerator	1.0
	Im just going to write it on this side	1.0
	And then Sophia said six 123456	1.0
	Not quite	1.0
Nine	Its nine because we want the total of all of the boxes	5.0
	So Sophia I think you were looking at just the six we used that just had blue and red in them somewhere	1.0
	But we want to look at 123456789	1.0
	So the answer to 23 of 23 is 49	1.0
	Right	1.0
	The activity on card 65 let me look at that and see I forgot to bring that out	1.0
	I want you to talk at your teams which would produce a larger product 12 x 13 or 12 x 15	8.0
	Discuss that in your team come up with an answer which one and then how do you know	8.0
	Okay so if you have to solve it whenever you have to do as a team come up with which ones larger	1.0
	Team One which one did you come up with	8.0
	Im going to put tick marks by what each team says	1.0
We came up with 12 x 13	So you think this ones bigger	2.0
Because	Oh yes tell me why	9.0
But if you do 12 of a 15 it would be 110 and a 16 has a bigger fraction than	Okay	1.0
	Team Two which one did you pick	8.0
Then also when you solve the problem for 12 x 15 it would  110 which is like Oliver said smaller than 16	If you have 16 of the pie you have more than if you had 110 of the pie	5.0
	Team Three what did you pick	8.0
We got 12 x 13	Why did you pick that one	9.0
So I just did the problem to make sure and	And this team	8.0
We did 12 x 13	Same one	3.0
	What was your reasoning	9.0
Because	Team 2 can you listen to Team 4 like they listened to you	1.0
We did the problem and we found out that it was the 16 and then 4  3 is	Okay	1.0
	Team Five which one did you pick	8.0
Because we ust kind of estimated 13 is bigger than 13 and 12  12 and so if you look at this  13 is bigger than	Okay	1.0
	So in this card what youre going to do is youre going to come up with five different problems in your team	1.0
	So if you have five people each person could come up with one	1.0
	These teams that have six if you want to go to a team that doesnt have five to make up your problem you can but youre making it up using these fractions and you can only use these and you cannot have the same problem more than once	1.0
	Let me find where it said okay youre using halves so you could use one half	1.0
	Were not going to use two halves	1.0
	You can use thirds so you could use 13 or 23 youre going to use fourths so you could use 14 24 is the same as a half so we re not going to put it 34 or you could use fifths 15 25 35 45 okay	2.0
	Let me see if theres anything else	1.0
	No thats it	1.0
	Okay so what youre doing lets say Im part of this team you guys are going to have this card	1.0
	Number one I would say my problem is going to be 35 x 23 thats my problem	1.0
	We have to find one of these squares that we can use its going to be divided in fifths and its going to be divided in thirds to show our work	1.0
It has to have that five and three or something	Yes	1.0
	Let me see if not then I m going to flip it over and draw it	1.0
	Okay so lets see fifths one two three four no	1.0
	One two three four five so this one has five and no its divided into one two three four five	1.0
	Thats five and five	1.0
Not necessary	No there isnt so I may have to flip it over or I may have to take off some boxes to make it work	1.0
	Yes I may have to draw extra or take some off	1.0
	All right draw it	1.0
Ive realized that we ve only done this with fractions can we use whole numbers	Yes	1.0
	We will do that but lets not jump ahead	1.0
	Your math message yesterday was 23 of 24 remember  of  means what	8.0
Multiply	Means to multiply	5.0
	All right Im going to give you your sheet each person come up with a problem and then solve it and see if as a team youve come up with the same answers for each problem	1.0
We each should have five problems	Yes	1.0
	Right here at the top theres a place to put five problems	1.0
Can the team with six people come to	Yes if you have six maybe go join another team so you can create a problem for them	1.0
Got it	Okay two things you need a something that youre siting by and right now if youre in groups of five and somebody needs to go be with a different partner then you can do that but you need one computer for the two of you	1.0

No yes	Hey you saw a half of it colored and then onethird	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If you count here theres one out of how many and then three out of how many	8.0
	Were getting good	1.0
	Its up there	1.0
		1.0
	Another true or false	1.0
red	I havent figured it out yet	1.0
	True or false	1.0
	Think about it	1.0
	The denominator tells you how many boxes you have total	1.0
	Okay last one	1.0
Were going to win anyway	All right	1.0
	The last thing that youre going to do silently on your own is page 177 number 2 and number 3	1.0
	Okay	1.0

	You can put your computer away and youre silently working on number two and number three	1.0
	group gets a point	1.0
	Yes we figured that out yesterday	1.0
	The other thing that theyll need in a few minutes is aSreference book	1.0
	Do you use those as partners	1.0
	Yes or usually I spin and have one person go get them which we can do	1.0
	Great yes	1.0
	All right would you please start with your whiteboard and marker	1.0
	You will need your math journals in a few minutes but were starting with just whiteboards and markers okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	My friends are mental math today is helping us think about fractions	1.0
	Is the sum greater than one whole or less than one whole	8.0
	Greater than one whole or less than one whole	1.0
	When we look here we have 24  14	1.0
	If you need to write it down on your whiteboard you can	1.0
	What were going to do is if you think the answer is greater than one whole show me a thumbs up	1.0
	If you think the answer is less than one whole show me a thumbs down	1.0
	You might need to you might not	1.0
	24  14	8.0
	Three two one show	2.0
	Answer is	8.0
Down	Less than	5.0
	Well say less than or greater than one whole	8.0
Less than	25  25	8.0
	Answer is	8.0
	Less than	1.0
	45 is less than a whole right	2.0
	46  36	8.0
	Greater than or less than one whole	8.0
	Answer is	8.0
	Greater than	1.0
	Is there a volunteer willing to share why they had greater than	9.0
	Claire	2.0
Then we have 36  46 then you would have 76	Which is	8.0
	When the numerator is seven is greater than six we know its	8.0
Greater than a whole	Greater than a whole	4.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Lets do this middle one right here in green	1.0
	Were just going to skip around	1.0
	Sometimes Travers will do things exactly like Miller sometimes Ill do things different	1.0
	38  48  28	8.0
	Do we think thats bigger than one hole or less than a hole	8.0
	Im waiting for a few thumbs	1.0
	38  48  28	8.0
	Answer is	8.0
Greater than	Why do you say greater than Cooper	9.0
I put two	You know what Im going to pause us right now because Im just getting the sense that were not all listening	1.0
	Cooper will you start again please	2.0
Then I have a question	Theres something that I want all of us to I want us to practice the language of Id like to revise my thinking because thats what good math students do	1.0
	Your brain might originally think something but then after you hear how other people solve you might change your thinking	1.0
	Thats really a good thing in math	1.0
	Its a great thing to be able to say I revise my thinking because and then explain why youd want a different answer now	1.0
	Yes my dear	2.0
You said	My dear	1.0
One whole	Well I dont think theyve set that problem out that way	1.0
	Have they	2.0
	Do you see one where it one whole	2.0
No	There you go	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets do one more my friends	1.0
	58  58	8.0
	Greater than one whole or less than one	8.0
You skipped some T2	I know I did	1.0
	The answer is	8.0
Greater than	Is it greater than or less than one whole	8.0
Greater than	Great	1.0
	Austin can you tell us why its greater than one whole	9.0
I know that 5  5 is 10 and 10 is greater than 8	108 is greater than one whole	2.0
Yes	Yes okay	5.0
	My friends would please leave your whiteboards on your desk	1.0
	Im going to have you come to the carpet please facing the screen	1.0
	Just like that	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Thank you for coming to the carpet so quickly and quietly	1.0
	Ms Miller when theyre on the carpet do they have a partner to talk to	1.0
	Well they dont really have an assigned partner I just tell them to talk to someone around them	1.0
	Great	1.0
Well its usually like	Or whos next to them	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	My friends our learning target today is were learning about how to use a line plot	1.0
	I want you to think about We come up here	1.0
	Were going to be recording data on a line plot and answering questions regarding the data	1.0
	The data that we look at today guess who its about	2.0
	You	2.0
What	Yes	1.0
	Were going to be collecting some data about each other and then organizing the data to make it makes sense for us	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	We will use data to create a line plot and answer questions	1.0
	The data will be about us	1.0
	Whats a line plot	8.0
	Thats our first question	1.0
	What is that	8.0
	Were going to be looking at something called a scale line plot	1.0
	Then we also have an important word to think about today	1.0
	Our math vocabulary word to think about today is interval	1.0
	Everybody say Interval	2.0
Interval	Okay lets think about what that means	1.0
	What is a scale	8.0
	A scale line plot and an interval	1.0
	Id like to hear all of your voices please	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
Identify the smallest minimum and the largest maximum numbers in your data set	Pause there	1.0
	Were going to have a data set a set of a bunch of numbers	1.0
	We need to find the	8.0
Minimum	And the	8.0
Maximum numbers	Thats going to help us	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	I want to hear all your voices were on the word these	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
The numbers on your scale should have the same interval or space between	I want everyone to think what does the same interval or space between them	8.0
	I want you to high five a partner standing by you	1.0
	Show me who youre going to talk to by high fiving that person	1.0
	Show me who you will talk to and then make a team of three if you need to	1.0
	I want to clarify what does this last sentence mean	8.0
	The numbers on your scale should have the same interval or space between them	8.0
	Talk with your partner	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Are you guys talking right here	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
Theres a pattern that	Each number has the same	1.0
have to find the same thing	With an equal amount of space	1.0
Yes	I think I heard a great conversation over here	1.0
	Would you be willing to share	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	said we should have the same interval or space between them	1.0
	What does that mean and why is that important	9.0
I think it means like how many inches they are	We need a unit of measurement to know what unit were talking about in our set of data	1.0
	I think thats a great start	1.0
	Would you call on the next person for us please	2.0
Me and Aiden said that an interval or space between them means the difference or the amount between	When you say them what is them	8.0
	The difference in between the	8.0
Student	Okay excellent	1.0
	Great	1.0
	Ethan will you add on to that please	3.0
Yes I also wanted to share	Excellent	1.0
We both have a bunch of paper and then	The spaces between	1.0
	When were talking about interval we want to think about that as an equal or same space between the numbers	1.0
Yes between the two of them	You got it	1.0
	Lets look at this fine plot	1.0
	We have scientists measured stag beetles in Europe	1.0
	I dont know what that is but I dont know	1.0
	Can you picture a little beetle in your head right now	2.0
	Everybody picture a beetle	1.0
	Okay back to our data	1.0
	Ill wait until youre ready	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Here are the measurements	1.0
	Whats the unit	8.0
Inches	Inches	4.0
	In order from the	8.0
Smallest	To the	8.0
Largest	We have one and a half to two inches two and a half inches and three inches	1.0
	This is the line plot that represents the data	1.0
	The line plot shows measurement data in Whats the interval	8.0
Half an inch	Half an inch interval	5.0
	I want you to think right now what are some questions you could I want you to ask a question about this set of data	1.0
	Thats tricky isnt it	2.0
Yes	Lets look at this line plot and lets think to ourselves What question could we ask about this set of data	8.0
	You want to start	2.0
Thats what was confusing	Thats a question you have	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	I have a question for you guys	1.0
	How many insects were measured	8.0
	Lets take partners you were just talking with	1.0
	How many insects were measured	8.0
	High five	1.0
	I want to hear your voices	1.0
	How many insects were measured	8.0
22	Im hearing a couple of different answers	1.0
	Aiden would you be willing to share	2.0
I think	Thank you for starting us	1.0
I	I appreciate you just jumping right in there and sharing your thinking	1.0
	Thats what good math students do	1.0
	Is there anyone else willing to share	2.0
	Josh	2.0
I counted the top I got 22	How	8.0
I counted the top it came out as 11	You counted this first row	2.0
	How many points in that set of data was	8.0
11	11	2.0
I just added eleven	Excellent	1.0
	Then 11  11 was	8.0
22	Excellent	1.0
	I did it a little different	1.0
	Did you do it a little different Paris	3.0
I took 3 and I added it to the 7 to get 10 plus the 9 plus the 3 to get 22	You actually looked at the actual line box and used some strategies to count them	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	I have another question for you	1.0
	What is the measurement of the longest beetle	8.0
	What is the measurement of the longest beetle	8.0
	Tell your partner	8.0
	Go	2.0
	High five	1.0
	Great job getting back to zero friends	1.0
	The measure of the longest beetle is	8.0
	Say it	2.0
Three and a half	Three and a half what	8.0
Inches	Three and a half inches	5.0
	What is the measurement of the shortest beetle	8.0
	Tell your shoulder partner	8.0
One and a half	One and a half what	8.0
Inches	Thank you	1.0
	You have to remember those labels in math right	2.0
	Lastly this one is going to make you do a little thinking	1.0
	What is the difference between the measure of the longest and the shortest insects	8.0
	Think about that first	1.0
	What is the difference between the longest and the shortest insects	8.0
	Tell your shoulder partner	8.0
	Go	2.0
	When youre ready to share give me a thumbs up	2.0
	Noah do your	8.0
I think its four halves is the differenceone and one half to minimum	Noah Im hearing you say four halves from one and one half to three and one half	5.0
Thats how I know its two	Good thinking	1.0
Then I revise my thinking with the	Noah what Im hearing you say is if you count by each interval each interval is half an inch and there is four halves or if you count three and a half minus one and a half you would get two inches	1.0
	The difference is two inches	1.0
	Friends I wanted you to just be able to see a line plot and recognize how to look at a line plot	1.0
	Now I want to have you Would you please go get your whiteboard and markers and come back to your same spot on the carpet	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Can you do this by the time the bell is done	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Thank you so much for being ready	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	We have some more data here	1.0
	Chuck planted sunflower seeds	1.0
	Two weeks later he measured the heights of the plants	1.0
	Here is the data	1.0
	My friends we have this list of data and we have some directions here how to help us organize the data	1.0
	Our first step to organize and think about the data is to put the measurements in order from what	8.0
Smallest to largest	Lets find out the smallest piece of data in the group	5.0
	What do you think it is	8.0
	Look at the data	1.0
	What is the smallest measurement	8.0
3 12	3 12	4.0
	Please write that at the top of your whiteboard	1.0
	Do we have any other 3 12	2.0
Its the only one	Do we have any 3 34	2.0
We have three	Ready my friends we have 3 34	5.0
	Please write it	1.0
	3 12	1.0
	We started with the smallest piece of data	1.0
	It was 3 12	1.0
	Then we have 3 34	1.0
	How many times do you see 3 34	8.0
Four	One two three four	5.0
	You should write down 3 34 how many times	8.0
Four	Four times	5.0
	Right now my friends we have written down 3 12 3 34 3 34 3 34 3 34	1.0
	Will you please look at your shoulder partners whiteboard and make sure that were all in the same place	1.0
	Give your shoulder partner a tip if they need to catch up with us on something	1.0
	Next	1.0
	Whats our next biggest measurements	8.0
4 12	Four inches	4.0
	How many times do we have four inches	8.0
Three times	One two three	5.0
	Please write four three times in your set of data	1.0
	All right then	1.0
	Then what is our largest piece of data	8.0
4 12	4 12	4.0
	Now my friends I want you to draw a line plot just like this but with this data	1.0
	Draw a line plot for the data	1.0
	Which numbers do you use as the first and last number on your scale	8.0
	My friends our intervals is what we have to think about right now	1.0
	We have half inches and quarter inches	1.0
	What do you think the interval should be on our scale	8.0
	Thats what we have to stop and think about	1.0
	I love how Im making some of you do some thinking	1.0
	Can I please have  a piece of paper	1.0
	Would you please talk with the person sitting next to you	1.0
	What should our interval be for this set of data	8.0
	We have to look at the denominator	1.0
I couldnt	You have your data on your sheet	1.0
It goes one half and then	By the way I love how you got started	1.0
	I can tell that you were thinking about your interval	1.0
	What measurement did you use to set up your line plot	8.0
	Im seeing a lot of great thinking right now	1.0
	Friends I want us all to think about if our smallest piece of data is Whats our smallest	8.0
3 12	Our largest is	8.0
4 12	4 12 right	2.0
	Were doing inches but we also have some 14 inches in between 34 of an inch	1.0
	When Im setting up my data for my line plot I want to think about if this was three inches and this was four inches	1.0
	Well we have 4 12 this should probably be five	1.0
	Lets start with our line plot set up like this my friends	1.0
	We need the same amount of space	1.0
	Thats what an interval is	1.0
	We need the same amount of space in between each of our intervals	1.0
	Whats in between three and four	8.0
	Whats in the middle of three inches and four inches	8.0
3 12	3 12	4.0
	Whats in the middle of four inches and five inches	8.0
4 12	4 12	4.0
Is it okay if I did this	We have to have the same amount of space in between	1.0
	Three inches and 3 12 whats in the middle	8.0
	3 14	1.0
	3 12	1.0
	In between three inches and four inches I need to make sure I have my quarter inches marked	1.0
	Then in between four inches and five inches we have 4 12 in the middle	1.0
	Im going to have everyone show me their whiteboards in a minute and Im really going to be checking for your intervals at the bottom	1.0
	We need to set up our intervals so that our line plot is set up correctly	1.0
	Whats in between 4 inches and 4 12	8.0
	You can look at how many spaces we have between 4 inches and 5 inches	1.0
	4 14 onequarter of an inch	1.0
	4 14 of an inch then 4 12 and 4 34	1.0
	Now that we have our intervals set up now we can put our line plot correctly	1.0
	We can place the Xs on our line plot right	2.0
Yes	Our smallest is 3 12	1.0
	How many 3 12 did we have	8.0
One	One	4.0
	Whats next	8.0
3 34	How many 3 34 did we have	8.0
I thought we had five	Let me go back to the data and check	1.0
	One two three four	1.0
	Was there a five	2.0
Yes I thought so	3 34 ones two three four	1.0
You need a half	Then my friends when we listed out our data what was our next biggest data point	8.0
	How many times did four occur in the measurement above	8.0
Three times	Three times	4.0
	One two three	1.0
	Whats the next data point	8.0
4 12	Do we have any 4 14	2.0
No we dont have any	We dont have any but we still need that	5.0
	We need 4 14 of this still on our line plot because it shows us correctly the data separated into intervals	1.0
	We dont have any 4 14	1.0
	Do we have any 4 12	2.0
Yes	How many	8.0
Two	Lets look at the data	1.0
Two	We have two	5.0
	Here is four inches and four inches	1.0
	Oops time is up	1.0
	Are we at 4 12 now	2.0
Yes	How many 4 12 did we have	8.0
Two	Two	4.0
Oh my God yes two	Is that the highest	2.0
thats the highest	Heres 4 12 and 4 12	1.0
	Is that the greatest	2.0
Yes	My friends this is our line plot	1.0
	The other thing our line plot means is we need to know what it represents	1.0
	What is this line plot all about	8.0
About	The distance or how long the stag beetle	1.0
	What does this information represent on the bottom	8.0
Length	Length	2.0
	In what	8.0
Inches	In inches	5.0
	Good thing its not feet or miles we dont want a three and a half foot stag beetle	1.0
	Thats why its so important that we have our unit	1.0
	Or three and a half miles	1.0
	We dont want a three and a half mile stag beetle	1.0
	Let me ask you a question	1.0
	In the data how many stag beetles were about four inches	8.0
Three	How many stag beetles were about four inches	8.0
	I want to hear your voices	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	Go	2.0
Three	Three	4.0
	We have stag beetles and we know that because we have three Xs each X represents one piece of data	1.0
I thought these were plants	These are beetles	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Are you ready	2.0
	You know what Max youre right	1.0
	Hes totally right	1.0
	Look at this first one was stag beetles	1.0
	Oh my goodness its a good thing you guys are careful readers because sometimes Im not	1.0
	Max awesome job my friend	1.0
	My friends T2 its not a stag beetle its a what	8.0
Sunflower	Max thanks for setting us straight	1.0
	We appreciate you	1.0
Yep	Guess what	2.0
	The rest of math today is data about you	1.0
	I need you to go put away that whiteboard and get out your math journal and a pencil	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Im going to show you the page when you want to be ready	1.0
	Ready	2.0
173	Ms Miller would you be my thinking partner please	1.0
	I would love to	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen youre going to be using a tape measure today	1.0
	Im going to give you some directions quickly and I need to know that you are with me	1.0
	Show me youre ready	1.0
	You will be using centimeters today and we are measuring to the nearest half centimeter	1.0
	You want a partner are going to measure each others heads	1.0
	I have rules about the tape measure	1.0
	You need to press the button gently and keep your hand on it while you are pulling it in and out because if you dont sometimes they break	1.0
	You need to be gentle and careful	1.0
	Ms Miller and I Would you do mine first	1.0
	Shes going to measure all the way around my head and then shes going to show you on the screen what the measurement is to the nearest half centimeter	1.0
Mason go to your seat	Now carefully put your finger where it is Ms Miller and now carefully show it on the dot camera	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Hey I need all of your eyes up here	1.0
	I got to show you something first though	1.0
	When I was measuring if you noticed the zero starts here not at the end of the tape measure	1.0
	Well make sure you start right here at the zero not at the plastic piece	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	When I wrapped it around I made sure that this where it ended right here where that five is I made sure that that was lined up with the zero Christian	1.0
	Now if you notice look 40 50	1.0
	50	1.0
	51 52 53 54 55	1.0
	Now if she said Measure to the nearest half does that mean that it will always fall on the half	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Friends youre going to be always looking wherever her finger was closest to the 55	1.0
	If it was closer to this middle mark the middle mark is the half centimeter	1.0
	Heres 54 centimeters 54 and	8.0
A half	half centimeters 55	5.0
	You need to look at exactly where your finger is were measuring to the half centimeter or the whole centimeter	1.0
	This is T2s just happened to be closer to the whole	1.0
	Your partners might be closer to half	1.0
	Just be careful you have to start it	1.0
What if you end it like	Were going to make sure that everybodys with us	1.0
	When I wrapped it around I made sure that that five met the zero	1.0
	Then notice that I wrapped it around from her forehead to the back of her head	1.0
	My friends your directions are on the top of your journal page	1.0
	Before you get up and find your thinking partner I want you to read all of number one in your head	1.0
	Go	1.0
	So that you know what to do	1.0
	Please read number one in your head	1.0
	You have a question Paris	2.0
No Im holding it	Youre ready	2.0
	Oh my gosh I love when youre ready	1.0
	My friends you have not very long no time to waste	1.0
	Three minutes with your thinking partner	1.0
	You are going to write down your head size in your journal	1.0
	Your thinking partner helps you find it	1.0
	You write down in your head size in your journal	1.0
	Your thinking partner is not the same	1.0
	Different	1.0
	before	1.0
	Ms Miller would you please call the first thinking partner in each group to come get a tape measure	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	These people are going to come and get a tape measure	1.0
	Ryan Hannahn Aiden Christian Kyle Fern Mason Paris Noah Jayden Josh Brian and Michael	1.0
	Id loved to see who your thinking partner is so you know who to go to	1.0
	Ms Miller do you have a timer	1.0
	I do	1.0
	Ms Miller where do we set a timer for	1.0
	You need to go find a thinking partner measure both partners heads	1.0
	Ready three minutes	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Maybe check it again just to be sure	1.0
	Check it again	1.0
	Sometimes you might have to measure twice to be sure	1.0
	All the way  plastic piece	1.0
	I know	1.0
	Can you put your finger right there	1.0
	I would agree	1.0
	Do you agree	1.0
	Yes so thats	1.0
	Now show her where we were	1.0
	closer to 49 12	1.0
	Friends you have one minute to be back at your desk	1.0
	Would you please take your tape measure back to the baskets	1.0
	Take your tape measure back to the baskets and head to your desk	1.0
	We are looking for the kids back in their seats	1.0
	I love how Colins showing us hes ready	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ms Miller is going to call your name	1.0
	Youre going to tell us your herd size and T2 is going to record it	1.0
	Its perfectly fine to have those two finishing up	1.0
	Were going to start collecting your data	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Im going to Lets start here at this team	1.0

I have the smallest head	Here Josh	2.0
	My friends heres what we have to start thinking about	1.0
	Ms Millers going to check something but you need to do some thinking	1.0
	Show me your eyes so I know youre with me	1.0
	Show me your eyes please	1.0
	When you think about whats our smallest what is our largest and what will our intervals be	8.0
	Do we have an adjustment	2.0
	Did we need to revise on our thinking	2.0
	We need to revise	1.0
	56	1.0
	Guys sometimes when we see If you noticed we had like an outlier	1.0
	We have to doublecheck our data	1.0
	If you notice these were all in the 50s	1.0
	and then we had a 64	1.0
	Hes actually 56	1.0
	We shuld to doublecheck	1.0
	This is our last data	1.0
	We need to think about this with our teams smallest largest and how are we going to set up the intervals on our line plot	1.0
	My friends would you please talk to your tablemates about what is the smallest what is the largest and how are we going to set up the intervals on our table	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Show your partners	2.0
	T2s hand is up	1.0
	Show your partners	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Where did your thinking land Paris	8.0
We said 49 would be the smallest and 56 would be the biggest	If you have similar thinking to Pariss team please stand up	3.0
	49 has the smallest and say it again	2.0
56 as the largest	As 56 as the largest	5.0
	Looks like we have a pretty good majority	1.0
	We agree	3.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Lets see sit down	1.0
	Paris did you guys talk about interval	2.0
Not yet	Was there any team that talked about an interval	2.0
We were confused	I am so glad that you said that	1.0
	If you think about when we set up this data should we do whole inches should we do half inches or centimeters should we do quarter centimeters	8.0
	How do we know	9.0
	Put your hands down	1.0
	Look at your face partner at your table group	1.0
	Now talk to that face partner	2.0
	What are you thinking about our interval how we should set up our line plot	8.0
	Go	2.0
	How are we going to set it up	8.0
	Why do you think is that	9.0
	Whole centimeters	2.0
	Half centimeters	2.0
	Quarter centimeters	2.0
I think we should put them off by half	Why do you think halves	9.0
Actually whole	Three two one zero voices	1.0
	Christian would you share the thinking that your team had about the intervals	9.0
We thought that we should do half centimeters because most people got half I think and we use centimeters to measure our heads	I heard Christian say We think we should set up our line plot in half centimeters because we have to make sure we represent all of the data up there	5.0
	Stand up if you have similar thinking	3.0
	We have to be careful listeners when T2s teaching	1.0
	Similar thinking	3.0
	Please sit back down	1.0
	Stand up if you have different thinking	3.0
About what	Stand up if you would like to add on or have a different idea or comment about how we should set up our line plot in intervals	3.0
Stand up Max	Max	2.0
Can I add	Yes	1.0
I think we should also set up in half centimeters because a lot of the numbers are halves between each of the numbers like 54 and 54 and a half and then 55 and then theres 54	We dont want to leave out any data	1.0
	We want to make sure we have enough room on our line plot to represent all of the data	1.0
	Cooper you were going to say something similar	3.0
I was going to say if we do ones	Get your pencils ready	1.0
	Lets start setting it up and Ill keep listening to you	1.0
	Okay	1.0
That would be a	What is our smallest piece of data	8.0
	What is our smallest number in the set	8.0
49	49	4.0
	Im afraid were not going to have enough room but well see	1.0
	Next will be 49 and	1.0
I cant do it still	Thats a good	1.0
	What do you think Ms Miller	1.0
	Someone said we dont have a 49 and a half	1.0
That was Anna	Why do we still have to put 49 and a half on it	9.0
one half as the interval	Yes exactly	1.0
	My friends we have to make sure that our line plot is set up with equal space between every single data point	1.0
	We have to represent the half inches and whole inches on the whole line	1.0
	Remember even on the example she showed in the SRB there were some that werent marked with any axis	1.0
	You have to have equal intervals	1.0
	If you skipped over a half then you wouldnt have an equal interval	1.0
	Make sure youre writing down what T2 is writing	1.0
	I think the large interval should be 56  because we wont fill it all	1.0
Yes were not going to fill it up	While were doing this my friends I might be confused about what these numbers represent	1.0
	What will our label be on part of the line plot	8.0
	What do these numbers represent	8.0
Centimeters	Distance around our heads in centimeters	1.0
	Good job	1.0
What about circumference	You definitely could use the word circumference	5.0
Or could we just write centimeters	I would add the word distance so that you know its not just a straight line because we are looking at the distance around something	1.0
T2 you said a 53 5 and a half	Thank you	1.0
	I will revise my math writing because thats what the math students do	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	How about that it worked out just perfectly	1.0
Just barely perfect	My friends before we go ahead and complete our line plot what should the title of our line plot be	8.0
Class	Class what	8.0
Heads	Class head sizes	2.0
	I love it	1.0
	Dont forget that titles need	1.0
Capitals	capitals on all the important words	1.0
You didnt put capitals	Its a label its not a title	1.0
	Good question	1.0
	Here we go my friends	1.0
Wait I missed that	Ms Miller would you mind being  White pointing to the data	1.0
	Sure	1.0
	and perhaps using another color to cross out the data that we use	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Our smallest is 49 right	2.0
Yes	How many times did 49 happen	8.0
One	A nice neat X in that box	1.0
	Do we have any 49 and a halfs	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Did we have any 50 centimeters	2.0
Yes	Lets count how many	1.0
One two	Two students in ourSShave a head size of 50 centimeters	1.0
Hannah and Alyssa	Did we have any 50 and one halfs	2.0
Yes one	Just one	5.0
	Just one	1.0

	No 55 and a half	1.0
	56	8.0
	We have	1.0
No more 56 12	Ladies and gentlemen I would like you to please giveT1a round of applause for helping me with the data	1.0
	I would like you to look at your thinking partner the one you measured your head with look at your person wave at them say Thank you for being my partner	2.0
Thank you for being my partner	I want you to stop and think about something else	1.0
	What is one piece of information that if Mr Oliver walked in right now and he said What are you working on	1.0
	What are you guys working on	8.0
	What are these Xs	8.0
	What would you tell him that we worked on today in math	8.0
	I want you to think	1.0
	Why did we do these activities	9.0
	Would you please stand up and go high five your thinking partner the one that youre matched up with on the board right now	1.0
	Stand up	1.0
	I want to see all kids standing and try finding their thinking partner	1.0
	Longest pair Id like you to talk first	1.0
	What did we work on today and why did we work on it	9.0
	Go	1.0
	What are those things called	8.0
	data right	2.0
	We collected some data	1.0
	Four three two one zero	1.0
	Please have a seat	1.0
	Were going to turn our eyes and ears to number four	1.0
Aiden	Aiden	4.0
You didnt ask anything	What	2.0
	Tell us why did we do this today	9.0
	What is this	8.0
Its easier to just let those two people that have 50 and the three that 54 12	Aiden this is what I think Im hearing you say	1.0
	Can I have everyones eyes and ears this way please	2.0
	When we have a long list of data like this its kind of hard to think about what it means and how much of each information we have	5.0
	When we have our data represented in a line plot we can see the information clearly and its easy to understand	5.0
	The line plots are easy to understand	1.0
	We could look up here and say Wow the largest head size in ourSSis what	8.0
56	56 centimeters	5.0
	How many kids in ourSShave a head size of 56 centimeters	8.0
Two	Two	4.0
	Now if we had just this list of information we have to skim it and scan it and think through it	1.0
	The line plot helps us organize the data	1.0
	I will be back tomorrow and we will do one more page to solidify our thinking about this okay	2.0
	Ladies and gentlemen you may listen to Ms Millers next directions	1.0
	You are going to put your journal away andT1is looking for the quietest	1.0
	Whos going to get to line up	1.0
Could we all just line up at the same time	Hows it going	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets do a refresher	1.0
	When we have a converted figure what is step number one	8.0
	Step number one	8.0
	Angelica	2.0
Identify your shapes	Identify your shapes	4.0
	If you want to be  I see a triangle	1.0
	I see a square and I see another triangle	1.0
	They might be the same size triangle Im not sure	1.0
	Should we wait and see I dont know	1.0
	Then youre going to write	8.0
	You cant just assume by looking at them right as a sequence	1.0
	You need to do the math	1.0
	No	1.0
	We have a triangle	1.0
	I dont think this pencil likes me this morning	1.0
	Im just going to use a pen	1.0
	Nottynotty	1.0
	Triangle plus a square plus another triangle	1.0
You might want to use your paper to hold it	What is the formula for the area of a triangle	8.0
	Neil	2.0
Base equals  divided by two	Base times height divided by two	5.0
	Im going to write that over here	1.0
	Base times height divided by two	1.0
	Whats the formula for the area of a square	8.0
Base times height	Base times height	4.0
	Now if you want to draw a line down to separate them you can	1.0
	I dont know if something	1.0
	All right	1.0
	What are the base and the height of the blue triangle	8.0
	I see no numbers anywhere around the blue triangle	1.0
	Should we skip it and come back to it	1.0
	Okay we can skip it come back to it	1.0
	What are the base and the height of the square	8.0
	Myra	2.0
Five	Five is the	8.0
Base and height	Of both yes	1.0
	Its five and five	1.0
	Everything okay	2.0
	Youre okay Dion	2.0
	All right now we have to find the base and the height of the triangles	1.0
	Daniel are you raising your hand for	2.0
	What	2.0
	You need to sharpen your pencil	1.0
Yes	Go ahead	1.0
	What are the base and the height of these triangles	8.0
	Base and the height	1.0
	Good job Ms Strahan	1.0
	Thanks	1.0
	There is this triangle here and theres this triangle here	1.0
	Talk with your team what do you think	8.0
	Wheres the paper	1.0
	Well you should turn your card	1.0
	Not totally	1.0
	So traveling from the 17 is Well get there	1.0
	What do you think the 17 represents	8.0
The number one	This right here is telling you that it goes from here to here and that is 17	1.0
	The 17 is the entire distance from this tip of the triangle to this tip of the triangle	1.0
	On this line thats how much space the square takes up	1.0
	If the whole thing is 17 do you know how much this space is	8.0
Five	Its five	5.0
	What do you think	8.0
	If the whole thing is 17 and this much is five whats left over	8.0
	If this is 17 and were going to take away five whats leftover	8.0
both	Whats 17  5	8.0
		4.0
	I cannot get this off	1.0
	If the rest is 12 and theres how many sections	8.0
Two	No this is gone because we know this is five	1.0
	Now we have this and this	1.0
	What do you think for you	8.0
I think it describes	No	1.0
	What	2.0
	If this and this theres two sections and if I were to put them together theyre 12 how much is each one then	8.0
	Whats half of 12	8.0
	Whats 12 divided by 2	8.0
	That means this one will be six this one will be six all right	1.0
	6  5 is 11  6 is	8.0
	Thats the whole	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	All right lets talk about how did we figure this out	1.0
	Were still working on it	1.0
	You know the answer	1.0
	First of all I heard a lot of questions	1.0
	People were saying whats this 17 right here	1.0
	What is this 17 on this line right here	8.0
	What does this represent Jorge	8.0
A graph	Its actually not a graph	5.0
	That would be a good guess	1.0
	How long what is Neil	8.0
Its the whole shape	The whole shape	4.0
	It is the distance from this end of the triangle to this end of the triangle	1.0
	If you see right here	1.0
	This is telling you that the whole thing is 17 wide	1.0
	The whole shape is 17	1.0
	Do we know any parts of this whole distance	8.0
	See how I have lines right here	1.0
	Ive drawn some lines to separate	1.0
	From here to here is the triangle	1.0
	From here to here is the square and from here to here is this triangle	1.0
	It also make it look like this	1.0
	You guys dont need to do this	1.0
	Im just helping you visualize	1.0
	Do we know any of those parts	8.0
	Emmy	2.0
We know  square five	We know that the square is five long right here	5.0
	We know that this much is five	1.0
	If the whole thing is 17 and now weve taken away 5 of it how much is left to figure out	8.0
Six	No how much is left to figure out Leon	8.0
	Two parts which are how long total	8.0
	What was	1.0
	12 so we know that we have 12 left and this part and this part equal 12 and they are the same	1.0
	They are 12 divided by 2 which is 6 so this is 6 and this is 6	1.0
	I can doublecheck it	1.0
	Whats 6  5	8.0
6  5  11	Its 11	5.0
	Whats 11  6	8.0
	17 thats what our total should be	5.0
	You could visualize the blue and the yellow on the bottom and recognize that if you were to move that straight up a little bit from the base of your triangle to the tip of your triangle thats the height of the triangle	1.0
	Could be right here	1.0
	Then youll be able to see your right angle at the base and you know about your height	1.0
	The base of my triangle the yellow one the base is here and the height is here	1.0
	The base is how much on the yellow triangle	8.0
Five	Five and the height is	8.0
Six	Six	4.0
	We are going to write five and six	1.0
	Base is five height is six	1.0
	How about the blue triangle	8.0
Same	Same thing	5.0
	Base is five the height is six	1.0
	This one I just started this way	1.0
	Right now that we have written our name of our shape weve written our formulas weve identified the base and the height of each of our shapes what is the next step	8.0
	Dean	2.0
Solve	Well we cant quite solve yet	5.0
	Start with the same letters solve though	1.0
Thats seven	Thats seven	4.0
	What is the word Im looking for	8.0
	I hear Whisper to me everyone	1.0
Substitute	Thank you	1.0
	Substitute substitute	4.0
	Make sure youre substituting the correct numbers	1.0
	We are on the blue triangle	1.0
	The base is five the height is six divided by two	1.0
	Plus the square the base is five the height is five	1.0
	Plus the triangle	1.0
	The base is five the height is six	1.0
	Its a triangle dont forget to divide by two	1.0
	Okay solve it	1.0
	Hi Will	1.0
	How was your weekend	1.0
Good	How was basketball	1.0
It was good	Did you win some games this weekend	1.0
Yes we won two games	Oh my gosh I got it	1.0
	is giving you a hard time	1.0
	I got it	1.0
	Theyve got to think about that	1.0
	Im persevering	1.0
	up your assistants	1.0
	Now I have to change from my girls to a different	1.0
	Do the  one	1.0
	All right got my answer	2.0
Yes	I dont know why my  is not  today	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Im going to pull some scripts to help me	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Sarah what Im I going to put here	8.0
	Help me in the blue triangle	1.0
Blue is the 15	Why 15	9.0
Because 5 x 6  30	Yes	1.0
30  2  15	5 x 6 Sarah says is 30	1.0
	30  2 is 15	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	How about the pink square Neil	8.0
	Whats the area of pink square	8.0
		4.0
	Leon whats the area of the yellow triangle	8.0
	Hi there	1.0
	Could you have Ms  call 5208 please	1.0
	Sure	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
		4.0
	Its the same as this other one	1.0
	30 divided by 2 which is 15	1.0
	Hey Joe what should I do now	8.0
You should add them up	Add them up so 15  25 is 40  15 is	8.0
	55 and its square units we dont know	5.0
	How many of you guys got 55	2.0
	Where are you going	1.0
	The person whos absent today has not fixed their subplans so the sub does not know where to go so I have to go to fix myself	1.0
	Do you want some coffee when I get back	1.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Okay sorry	1.0
	Anyone else wants some coffee when she comes back	1.0
Me	Okay here you go	1.0
	Go for it do this one	1.0
	Everybody together work with your partners with your team	2.0
	Figure out the area of this	1.0
	Now please listen	1.0
	Listen up	1.0
	This represents what	8.0
	This 18	8.0
	The total height of the shape so think about a part	1.0
	So please read our target Christine	2.0
	Dont step on that	1.0
	All right Matteo please read R	2.0
I know  common denominator	Daniela next one	2.0
is also a common denominator	And finally Dean	2.0
Multiply the two original denominators and use their products as a common denominator	All right the lesson you guys did on Monday or Tuesday with Mrs Porter you did a really great job almost every single person got a three on the exit slip	1.0
	That showed me you really understood finding equivalent fractions	1.0
	Were going to be using that idea today to continue our work with finding common denominators	1.0
	Im going to be teaching you several different ways to find common denominators were going to start with a little video to get you guys your brains into	1.0
I sure like pie	Please	1.0
	Oh youre Dan and Jonah I want to know how to add and subtract fractions from Joshua	1.0
	Pies are perfect for talking about fractions	1.0
	As you can see this is one pie thats one part of one whole or one over one in fraction form	1.0
	If I cut the pie right down the middle I get two pieces each piece is one divided by two or one half of the whole	1.0
	One half plus one half equals two halves or one whole	1.0
	In a fraction the numbers have names the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator	1.0
	The denominator tells us how many pieces make up one whole the numerator tells us how many of those pieces were dealing with	1.0
	The two in this case is a common denominator shared by both fractions	1.0
	When you add fractions with the same denominator you add the numerators while the denominator stays the same	1.0
	Each of these pieces is one divided by four or one fourth of the whole we can see that one fourth plus one fourth equals two fourths or one half	1.0
	Lets say we want to add one fourth of this pie to one half of another one	1.0
	Cutting pie one fourth and one half are fractions with different denominators	1.0
	To add them we need to find their LCD or lowest common denominator	1.0
	Its basically the lowest common multiple of the fractions denominators	1.0
	For our denominators two and four that number is four we want to write all of our fractions as fractions of four	1.0
	One fourth already is and as we saw before one half and two fourths are really the same thing	1.0
	Now that we have a common denominator we can just add the numerators two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths	1.0
	Subtraction is the same idea	1.0
	As long as we have a common denominator its just a matter of subtracting the numerators	1.0
	If we dont have a common denominator we find the lowest common denominator and rewrite our fractions to match	1.0
	Heres a good example	1.0
	Last year Jonahs pies were the highest selling items in the bake sale in fact five ninths of all the students in our school bought them but the year before only five twelfths of the school bought the pies	1.0
	Come on it was the first year you made them people didnt know how good they were yet	1.0
	Anyway to find out what fraction of students bought the pies the second year but not the first year we would subtract five twelfths from five ninths	1.0
	The denominators are nine and 12 whats the LCD	8.0
	Good 36	1.0
	Thats the lowest number that both nine and 12 multiply into evenly	1.0
	Lets rewrite our fractions as fractions of 36	1.0
	Lets see to turn nine into 36 we need to multiply by four which means we also have to multiply the numerator by four and to turn 12 into 36 we multiply by three which means we can also multiply five by three	1.0
	Now we can just subtract the numerators to get our answer between last year and the year before your sales increased by five 36ths	1.0
	All these pies we cut up theyre going to go bad unless I eat them	1.0
	Oh no this is your fault for making so many pies	1.0
	I want you to take a moment to think please and I want you to think what is something I already knew from that video that it reminded me	1.0
	And what is something new I learned from that video	1.0
	And if you truly did not learn anything new then you can say two things you already knew	1.0
	So think	1.0
	ET high five Christine and Eloise then Pete right behind you two  is there anybody else	2.0
	We will have one group of three Morgan why dont you be with Derek and then  why dont you just pop back here with Dean	1.0
	All right go ahead and talk something new you learned something you already knew	1.0
	Getting quiet means everyones shared	1.0
	Callie pass this to Callie tell what your partner said she learned	3.0
She didnt know how to do that	Okay	1.0
	Pass the mic to Parker	1.0
	Parker tell me something your partner already knew that the video reminded them of	3.0
My partner she already knew how to find the lowest common denominator	All right	1.0
	Boys and girls were going to learn multiple ways to find your common denominator because in order to add fractions you need what	8.0
	Think	1.0
	In order to add them you need what	8.0
	Morgan	2.0
LCD	Which means what	8.0
Lowest common denominator	You have to have a common denominator you cannot add fractions that do not have a common denominator	1.0
	Thank you I briefly saw please pass that to Justin active listening thumb the only one I saw	1.0
	Right now I want to review what you guys did a great job with on your exit slip	1.0
	The first way is just listing equivalent fractions	1.0
	I want you on your whiteboard to list the equivalent fractions for onethird and threefourths	1.0
	List four equivalent fractions	1.0
	T That one	1.0
	Im going to give you about 30 more seconds Im looking around and even though you did awesome on the exit slip Im seeing some people who remember and some people who are struggling	1.0
	If you are struggling feel free to ask somebody near you can you help me if you notice someone	1.0
	My friends who are struggling this is literally no different than your exit slip which everyone did a super awesome job on	1.0
	The difference and maybe this little clue will help you is that your exit slip was a chart that had numbers at the top remember those	2.0
Yes	Youre doing the same thing on your exit slip	1.0
	Same exact thing even though I didnt put that chart there the skill is the same	1.0
	Talk with your partner right now	2.0
	How did you find your equivalent fractions how and does this remind you or help you based on that was your exit slip that you were successful on	2.0
	Go	1.0
	I agree with this can you explain to him how you did it	8.0
	Who is partners here with Max	1.0
	Are you I dont know why its doing that	1.0
	Friend what you have here you dont even have the original fractions	1.0
	You actually never turned in your exit slip either	1.0
	Annabelle will you come and Annabelles partner	1.0
	Hold up your whiteboard and explain your thinking so far and partner come with her	8.0
	Front of the room	1.0
	Show your whiteboard to the class so they know what to look at	1.0
We multiplied all numbers by first two and just multiplied by three and four and then five	My question is whats it	8.0
The fraction	What parts of the fraction	8.0
The numerator and the denominator	Thats really important theres a huge difference	1.0
	Cap your markers place them put them down	1.0
	Theres a huge difference between saying we multiplied it and I multiplied both the denominator and the numerator	5.0
	If I am explaining that piece to a thirdgrader Pete and I say I multiply it are they going to understand what youre saying	2.0
No	We have to use our math vocabulary whats the math vocabulary I want to hear from you today	8.0
Numerator and denominator	Yes and	8.0
Common denominators	Common denominators thank you all take the mic back	5.0
	A lot of people were stumped and putting that chart up helped it click but to find an equivalent fraction all youre doing is multiplying the numerator Hadley and the denominator by the same thing	1.0
	You dont need a chart just know okay I can multiply it by two and get what	8.0
	What fraction	8.0
	If I multiply it by three think and when I point I want you to say the answer	1.0
	Whats my next equivalent fraction multiplied by three	8.0
Three ninths	Multiplied by four	8.0
412	Max multiply it by five	1.0
	Multiply the numerate and the denominator both by five what would my new fraction be	8.0
	Start with the numerator one whats one times five	8.0
	Now the denominator whats three times five	8.0
	And whats my fraction	8.0
	Yes exactly	1.0
	All right take a look at your show me thumbs up if you have those some sideways if you had some wrong thumbs down if you are really confused	2.0
	Now you should have done this in different colors	1.0
	Three fourths same rule same thing to find equivalent fractions we do what	8.0
	Who can raise their hand and share what do we need to do to find equivalent fractions	8.0
	Liliana	2.0
I need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	Yes nice active listening thumbs	1.0
	If I multiply both by two what do I get	8.0
Six eighth	Three	8.0
912	Four	8.0
1216	Five	8.0
1520	If Im looking to add these together and Im looking for the common denominator whats a synonym for common	8.0
	Think	1.0
	Tell your partner	2.0
Same	Tell me	8.0
Same	I want the denominator thats the same whats the denominator thats the same	8.0
	Ivy I need your body whole body turned around facing	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Your whole body though not just the top part	1.0
	Look at our numbers think show me a thumbs up when youre ready whats the common denominator going to be for these two factions	8.0
	My friends who dont have the thumbs up its right up here you dont have to do any more thinking we already did the thinking you just need to look for the one that means common or whats that synonym	8.0
Same	Daria what is my common denominator going to be	8.0
The common denominator is going to be 12	Awesome sentence there Daria	1.0
	I agree so if Im adding or subtracting these fractions 13 or 34s I would need to change them to 12 as their common denominator	5.0
	This is a review from Tuesday	1.0
	Hey show me thumbs up sideways down	2.0
	How are you feeling on this	2.0
	Okay if youre sideways thats okay	1.0
	Im going to show you three other ways	1.0
	When were adding and subtracting you get to choose which way makes the most sense to you	1.0
	The second way of doing this is checking to see if one denominator is a multiple of the other	1.0
	For example what if I have the fraction 23 and I need to add 515s	1.0
	If you know your times tables you already see something	1.0
	Share with your partner what you might notice from this	8.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Put that back in the middle	1.0
	Eloise what did you and your partner notice	8.0
That the denominators are the same	True I agree	1.0
	Did anybody notice anything different	3.0
	Parker	2.0
That if you multiply three times five you get 15 which is the common denominator and also five is a numerator for that	What Parker is saying is he noticed that three is a factor of 15	5.0
	Factor means that I can multiply two numbers to get the answer of 15	1.0
	This is something with fractions well do a lot	1.0
	If you didnt notice that right away because maybe times tables arent your jam you can think and list the factors	1.0
	What times what equals three	8.0
One	One time what	8.0
One times two	One times two is two	5.0
One times three	One times three okay	5.0
	I can also list the factors for 15 so one times what equals 15	8.0
	Okay does two times anything equal 15	2.0
No	What about three	2.0
Yes	Three times what	8.0
Five	What about four	2.0
No	Five	2.0
Yes	Yes we already have it	5.0
	Okay factors always come in pairs and in doing this you might notice hey threes a factor of both of them but that doesnt matter for this one	1.0
	Yes factors doesnt matter for this one because we cant divide five divided by three so I chose four numbers	1.0
	I could change it though	1.0
	Here we go six	1.0
	Now this is probably the most challenging way	1.0
	This is probably the way that people arent going to choose to do or if other ways are easy you can try this way because it does not work for every single fraction	1.0
	Im going to talk you through it but if you dont understand thats okay	1.0
	Weve been multiplying	1.0
	The same thing works with dividing	1.0
	I could take 653 and six divided No thats not going to work either	1.0
	See	2.0
	I told you it doesnt work	1.0
		1.0
	That will work 1052	1.0
	Now I can add 2323 to get my answer	1.0
	Okay like I said this way here isnt helpful but if I notice that 3 is a multiple of 15 or a factor of 15 I can do 35 which is what were going to move on to with our next step	1.0
	Finding the least common denominator	1.0
	To do this we find the least common multiple	1.0
	Lets see here let me think of some fractions	1.0
	Somebody give me a pretty easy fraction	8.0
	Lily	2.0
23	Okay	1.0
	All right Im going to say 14 to find the least common denominator what we need to do is we need to list the multiples of three and the multiples of four	1.0
	What are multiples	8.0
	Those are just our times tables thinking 31 is	8.0
Three	32 is	8.0
Six	Now what	8.0
5 4 12 15 18	Okay Im going to stop there	1.0
	Usually we can stop at four or five	1.0
	All right lets do the same thing for four	1.0
	Four	8.0
8 12	Do you notice something	2.0
Yes	What do you notice	8.0
	Share with your partner what do you notice	8.0
	Lily what did you and your partner notice	8.0
That theres two 12ths	That theres two 12ths	4.0
	Weve already hit our least common denominator and it is 12	1.0
	I dont like doing a lot of extra work so Im not going to keep naming my multiples	1.0
	As soon as I hit the same one I stop	1.0
	Now I need to make my equivalent fraction	1.0
	In order to do that I need to do what	8.0
	Share with your partner	2.0
	How do we make an equivalent fraction	8.0
	Allie came up here and told us or it was Sophie	1.0
	Sophie and Dean came up here and told us what do we need to do to make our equivalent fraction	8.0
	Talk with your partner go	2.0
	Amaya how do we find our common or how do we find an equivalent fraction	8.0
	Whats it	2.0
	Remember we corrected that with them	2.0
	What specific math vocabulary do we need to use	8.0
Denominator	And	8.0
Numerator	By	8.0
	Tilus do you want to help her out	3.0
Just remember the same number	Yes so what number are we going to multiply them by	8.0
	Its really easy to find	1.0
	I just count one two three four	1.0
	Im multiplied by my 3 by 4 to get 12	1.0
	Im going to multiply both of these by four	1.0
	24	8.0
Eight	34	8.0
	Okay now for four I did count	2.0
One two three	13	8.0
Three	43	8.0
	12 and there we go	5.0
	This is my favorite way	1.0
	This is the way I like to do it	1.0
	Yes	2.0
Does it work with every fraction	Works with every fraction	5.0
	You might have to keep going for a while before you hit a common one but it will work with every single fraction	1.0
	All right lets try on our whiteboards with our partner lets practice this one	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets try the problem thank you	1.0
	Lets try using this strategy of finding the least common denominator with the fractions of 15 and 34	1.0
	Find the equivalent fractions with the common denominator	1.0
	I want you to use the third method there	1.0
	Work with your partner	2.0
	I got it	1.0
	Maria I saw a whiteboard on your desk Im not sure what happened to it	1.0
	Lets use a whiteboard and not Thats just because we take notes on that	1.0
	Do you need a marker	1.0
	Is that the problem	1.0
	What are you doing just snatching it from me	1.0
	Come on man	1.0
	What can we do if we dont have the resources we need	1.0
	Whats the strategy	1.0
	Okay so can I ask why you didnt ask	1.0
	You know the strategy youve got to do it	1.0
	I think you dont know that	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets take a look at this	1.0
	Four	2.0
	Between 12 and 15 is only three numbers not four	1.0
	Okay Im going to give you about 30 more seconds	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Just rub it for me	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thats fine	1.0
	See how easy it is to ask and get our problem solved	1.0
	Fingers crossed that one works	1.0
	Yes	1.0
No its 2 20 20 20	Thats weird	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	See you very soon	1.0
	Thats good	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Teyden and partner come on down and show us what it is that you did	8.0
	Okay Daniela and Kayla would you mind cleaning that up so these boys can focus over here	1.0
	Talk friend thats why I gave you the mic	1.0
get a common denominator of	Okay	1.0
	Its confused because youre holding the pen and Maybe hand off the pen to your partner or something	1.0
No 14  and then 3515	Okay what do you guys think	3.0
	Derek how did you guys know to multiply 34 by 5	8.0
	The numerator and the denominator by five	8.0
	Think back to what strategy I used up there	1.0
	What did I do	8.0
	Who can remind Derek what I did	3.0
	Derek phone a friend or if you know say	1.0
She looked at the multiples and she counted how many multiples into the common denominator	Okay so count for me Derek how many multiples for the 4 until you hit the 20	8.0
One two three four five	Yes thats how we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by five	5.0
	Now class whats a resource Thank you boys	1.0
	Whats a resource you can use if youre not super awesome with your times tables	8.0
	What resource can you use to find them Molly	8.0
Find an	What part of it	8.0
The very end I think or beginning	It has what tool	8.0
Yes  multiplication table	Yes	5.0
	That multiplication table literally has the multiples in a row	1.0
	Super easy	1.0
	Although you should know it without the multiplication table especially since youre about to become sixth graders	1.0
	All right final one final strategy	1.0
	This is a students favorite strategy because it takes the least amount of time	1.0
	However its not always the best strategy especially moving into sixth grade when they will be expecting you sorry to reduce your fractions or use simplest form	1.0
	This strategy can cause you extra work but it works	1.0
	Somebody give me a fraction not a super complicated fraction	8.0
110	Okay I asked for it	1.0
	All right I need another fraction thats a little more challenging than 110 but keep it under 12 as our denominator	8.0
	Esther	2.0
46	Okay	1.0
	The final strategy is called the quick common denominator	1.0
	For this strategy I take my denominators and I multiply them	1.0
	I do 106	8.0
		4.0
	This is my new common denominator	1.0
	Its not the least one though always so I cant call it my least common denominator its just a common denominator	1.0
	What do I need to multiply 10 by to get my equivalent fraction 110	8.0
	What do I need to multiply 110 by	8.0
	Gracie	2.0
Six	Yes because we multiplied 10 by 6 to get 60 right	2.0
	Im going to multiply this by six the numerator by six and the denominator by six	1.0
	16 is	8.0
Six	106 is	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to do the same thing for 46 except what do I need to multiply 46 by	8.0
		4.0
	Yes	1.0
	The opposite	1.0
	410 is	8.0
	610 is	8.0
	Now I have my fractions	1.0
	4060 and 660	1.0
	Heres the deal	1.0
	If its not least common had we have done it out this way we would have stopped at 30 and we wouldnt have gone all the way up to 60 and that would have been the least common	1.0
	But this works theres nothing wrong with it okay	2.0
	Any questions	2.0
	Yes sir	2.0
I dont get how they got 1520	All right do I have anybody who wants to come up and clearly show where the 1520 came from using maybe the strategy I used over there	8.0
	Just that one part you asked for the 1520 right	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
Okay so what you do is you	Pass this to Luka	1.0
Okay	To clarify as well we found it because we already multiply that by five	5.0
	So I want to make sure that were clear were always multiplying what	8.0
	Two things the	8.0
Numerator and denominator	If you only do one of them its not equivalent okay	2.0
	All right	1.0
	In a moment Im going to ask you to return to your seats and Im going to ask you to look at page 156 in your math journals	1.0
	For page 156 youre going to be working with your purple partner and youre going to be doing SageNScribe	1.0
	get this to Hadley and Harley	1.0
	I noticed that these two friends are taking notes even though I did not ask them to which I think is a great strategy	1.0
	This will be up for you	1.0
	Youre going to SageNScribe for numbers one through seven	1.0
	You can decide who goes first I really dont care	1.0
	Yes	2.0
If the Scribe thinks that the Sage isnt correct can they help	Absolutely	1.0
	If the Scribe thinks the Sages wrong you can stop them give them a hint	5.0
	Like you might say I noticed when I was walking around somebody put 15 for one of the factors of four	1.0
	And I said Hey I noticed that 12 plus three is 15 not 12 plus four so that was my hint and then they figured out their mistake okay	2.0
	So you absolutely can	1.0
	If they totally dont get it help them as needed	1.0
	Quick review with your partner currently whats SageNScribe	1.0
	Whats my expectations	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Five four three two and one so on your math journal I should only see every other problem	1.0
	So if youre Scribe for number one I would see writing for one three five and seven	1.0
	If youre Scribe for number two Id see writing for two four and six	1.0
	If you have writing for every single one of them youre not doing this right and youre going to get a fine okay	2.0
	So lets head back	1.0
Purple	Purple yes purple partner	1.0
	And friends who are sitting right by me theres a pencil	1.0
	Theres a mechanical pencil	1.0
Can we get snacks	Yes you may eat snacks now	1.0
	My expectation is that you are working in 10 seconds	1.0
	Yes 156 to 157	5.0
	Were starting with number one	1.0
	Some of you are starting at the top of the page	1.0
	Thats not number one	1.0
	So whos my purple  You two	2.0
	either Eloise or you guys need to Ivy I could not tell at all you were Eloises partner because you were facing away from her	1.0
	Can you turn your whole body to face towards her	1.0
	Then whos going to go first	2.0
	Okay so that means youre telling her what to do	1.0
	For number one A is already done for us	1.0
	So now you need to use that information to do B	1.0
	Weve already found the  fractions here so were adding and what would the answer will be	8.0
	Pardon	2.0
	So where is the 18 coming from	8.0
Like maybe on your whiteboard its like	When she says 18 do you understand where youre supposed to write the 18	8.0
	Listen to the difference	1.0
	I agree but I would say instead Ivy I would say the denominator is 18	1.0
	Do you know what to write if I say that	8.0
	Okay write it or here upon B	1.0
	So the denominator is 18	1.0
	Perfect now she knows exactly	1.0
	Now what can you	1.0
	Here are your fractions already done for you	1.0
	Were adding so now were going to have the	1.0
	Brooke you already did the denominator	1.0
	The numerator is	1.0
	Just a little reminder to help these ladies out with the vocabulary	1.0
	So whats the numerator	8.0
	Help her specifically just like I told you	3.0
	Now you need to do it for this one but pay attention to the order because the order has switched	1.0
	So when youre looking at these the order has switched	1.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	Whats this number called in a fraction	8.0
Numerator	Not a mumerator a numerator	5.0
	Whats the bottom one called	8.0
Denominator	When you are talking to your Scribe you need to be specific okay	2.0
	Also I caution you very much with the subtraction problem pay attention to the order	1.0
	I also want to see all work on the page	1.0
	For example if I have to find number one all the hard work is done for you as an example you already have your new fractions	1.0
	You dont have to do any other work	1.0
	But number two you do	1.0
	You might say something like  Write a four  Now write the multiples of four	1.0
	Four eight	8.0
12 16 20	Then whats the other number	8.0
	We re on number two	1.0
Number two	No whats the other denominator	8.0
		4.0
	So then I might tell my person  Write a 12 write an equal sign	1.0
	Now write the multiples of 12	1.0
	Do I need to keep going	2.0
No	No so I might tell my partner to stop because you already found your common multiple	5.0
	So youre specifically telling them each and every step okay	2.0
	The other thing I noticed for number one is even though it has the answer for you you might want your Scribe to write	1.0
	So you might say what is it 56 minus 29	8.0
	Whats the equivalent fraction for 56	8.0
1518	I might say  Write 1518 minus  whats the other fraction	8.0
418	418 because this is showing your work right	1.0
Yes	Then I might say 15 minus four equals	8.0
	The denominator stays the same so it is 18	1.0
	I want to see you writing out the new problems with the common denominator okay	2.0
	Keep working	1.0
	Okay friends youve had several minutes to work and already worked with a whole partner group on number one and	1.0
	So whos the Scribe for the first one	2.0
	Whos the Scribe for number one	2.0
	That should have already been decided	1.0
	You guys have had like five minutes to work already	1.0
	So youre the Sage then if youre talking and he s the Scribe	1.0
	Callie I like how you got up to work and help her	1.0
	Hey good job	1.0
	You tricked me	1.0
	Actually for some reason I was  my head because I thought	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	I ll fix them	1.0
	Now you keep talking	1.0
	I gave you a ton of hints for yours Ivy	1.0
	Its up on the board what you need to tell her	1.0
	That should be finished so she can move on and tell you	1.0
	If Im being a Sage and I notice what shes doing Well first of all you told her four times two and one times two	2.0
	But Im confused thats why Im multiplying one times two	1.0
	Because if I do one times two I have to do two times two and that only gets me a denominator of four not 14	1.0
	So if Im going to be for Sage Id start just with this fraction and Id say multiply the numerator of four times two and put that as your new numerator	1.0
	All right keep going guys	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	Multiply the numerator four times two	1.0
	So right here next to it write times two	1.0
	Youre making yourself do more work than you need to because its already there	1.0
	Now that makes my new numerator so make a new fraction right here with your new numerator as eight	1.0
	It s my numerator so if I look at my work up here  is the numerator on the top of the fraction or in the bottom	8.0
	The top	1.0
	You want to put it when you write it on the top okay	2.0
	Now Im going to do my denominator seven times two	1.0
	Well you cant write 14	1.0
	I didn t tell you to write 14	1.0
	I told you to write seven times two	1.0
	Now seven times two equals 14 thats my new denominator	1.0
	Okay so my question is why are your fractions crazy wonky like that	8.0
	You want your fractions to look like this okay	2.0
	I know but youve got to then tilt your book differently so it comes out straight	1.0
	Did you hear how I told her that	2.0
	So you coach her for the next one okay	2.0
	Hold on sir	1.0
	I have a question class	1.0
	What have you found frustrating	1.0
	What have you found frustrating about the SageNScribe Eloise	2.0
My partner not telling me exactly where to put the numbers	Show me thumbs up if you found that frustrating	1.0
	Okay anything else found frustrating	2.0
	I heard someone say Not knowing what to say not knowing how to describe it	1.0
	Anybody else found that frustrating	2.0
	Yes I see that	1.0
	Ive seen that coming through both of those things people not being specific and people really struggling at what to say	1.0
	So if you havent struggled at what to say that probably shows you have a clear understanding of it	1.0
	Remember I said I wanted to work on your board on there	1.0
	What Im going to do now because Im going to switch from SageNScribe to just working together to solve at least two more problems	1.0
	I look at our time were going way over our math time and we need to wrap it up and you doing SageNScribe is making it go a little longer	1.0
	So if you and your partner want to continue SageNScribe go for it if youve got a jam and youre doing good otherwise I want you to just work together to solve	1.0
	Asking questions if you and your partner are stuck	1.0
	Mr Michaels and I are here to walk around and help	1.0
	Please use us because thats our job	1.0
So	No just from wherever youre at now just start working together	1.0
	Good question	1.0
	All right so were on number two right now	1.0
	She already told you how to do this one	1.0
	I was there when she told you how to do that one	1.0
	I was totally there when she told you not to do that one	1.0
	Well maybe she moved on to this one because this one she told you that denominator was 18 remember	2.0
	And she told you the numerator was 19	1.0
	You even wrote it	1.0
	So numerator is 19 because were taking five plus 13 okay	2.0
	Now this one you are subtracting	1.0
	So now were working together though Ivy so you dont have to worry about the SageNScribe piece	1.0
	What is it going to be if Im subtracting these two	8.0
	And that one I have up on the board	1.0
	See the 1518 minus 418 up on the board	2.0
	So why dont you write that right here and write this	1.0
	Derek and Daria I need to see you working not just sitting	1.0
	Its not acceptable	1.0
	We dont have time to waste	1.0
	This 1518 came because 56 is the same as 1518	1.0
	Then the second number	1.0
	418 yes	1.0
	Thats why we put them in that order	1.0
	Okay so I disagree with what you wrote down	1.0
	Thats not following our strategy so erase	1.0
	The answer is already up there too	1.0
	Then thats going to go right here	1.0
	Derek	2.0
	Okay then lets move okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	The next one I also did the front work for you and	1.0
	See the four and the 12 there	2.0
	We already know that the common denominator is 12 because we did that work together	1.0
	How Im I going to find the equivalent fractions for 34 what do I need to do	8.0
	Can I see one of your whiteboards and markers	1.0
	Aha there we go	1.0
	So its is 24 to 30 how big of a jump is that	8.0
	Ive got 34 I know I need a common denominator of 12	1.0
	What do I need to do	8.0
Wait is that in right now	Multiply You do count	1.0
	You can count up there	1.0
	See where it says the multiples of four Ivy	2.0
	How many over is 12 if I count	8.0
	More than two	1.0
	The four would be one the eight would be two the 12 would be what	8.0
	Three	1.0
	So I have to multiply always and this is where you made your mistake	1.0
	The numerator and the denominator by three okay	2.0
	So next to here multiply just like I did by three	1.0
	So you write what I wrote here	1.0
If youre not weird then youre weird in a bad way	Now solve that	1.0
	Whats the new fraction going to be	8.0
	Notice how I wrote times three times three	2.0
	I want you to write that times three times three	1.0
	So that way if you get stuck later you can go back to this one and	1.0
	What did you get  fraction	8.0
	But thats not a fraction	1.0
	Can you erase what you have please	1.0
	Youre making a fraction of Good keep doing	1.0
	Does this one need to change	2.0
	Whats the denominator	8.0
	Three times three equals what	8.0
	Four times three equals what	8.0
	This is my new fraction	1.0
	This is what I need to write in that	1.0
	Now this one already has the denominator of 12 so I just rewrite it	1.0
	I dont have to change anything	1.0
	Okay now were adding but were not adding that problem Okay Ill be there in a second	1.0
	Were not adding this problem were adding our new numbers	1.0
	Were adding these two numbers	1.0
	So Im really going to be adding 912 plus whats the other one Ivy	8.0
	But this is not 912 because it already has 12 so it has to stay the same	1.0
	So its 712	1.0
	Then I need you now to erase those answers because youre working ahead and youre not doing it correctly	1.0
	I have 912 plus what	8.0
	And you can write it right here right	2.0
	Your new problem 912	1.0
	So right here youre writing your new problem 912 plus  because it didnt change	1.0
	Now what does that  You can write it there on the line	1.0
	Its okay	1.0
	and Hadley come here bring your stuff	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
We multiply both of them by	Youve done everything Daria is only looking at you	1.0
	You are about to get a fine	1.0
	You need to work	1.0
	If you need to join your group if you need to listen to me thats fine but	1.0
	Okay so which one are you stuck on	2.0
	Were working through	1.0
	Are you stuck or is Hunter is stuck	2.0
	Youre both stuck	2.0
	Then join us and listen up	1.0
	Can one of you tell what weve done so far	8.0
	We already figured that out together	1.0
	Were multiplying the three by three and the four by three because if I look up there Kayla Im speaking	1.0
	The 12 is one two three numbers  okay	2.0
	Thats why I multiplied them by three and got my new fraction	1.0
	So see how  wrote it down here	2.0
	Thats what I want you guys to do right now	1.0
	All right so and if you have your problem now	1.0
	Okay so the denominator never changes so its going to stay at 12	1.0
	Your answer would be 16	1.0
	Okay now rewrite	1.0
	Same thing 34 is now 912 and the other one stayed the same	1.0
	Yes stay the same	1.0
	So now here youre just going to rewrite that problem with these new numbers and do the adding	1.0
	can I ask what youre doing	2.0
	Are you asking for help	2.0
	Because youre literally going too fast	1.0
	Just bring it to me because right now were doing math on something that it seems like we need some help with	1.0
Can you help me with this at least	Thank you	1.0
	Okay so youve got to add the top	1.0
	Good I agree	1.0
	Now which one is bigger	8.0
	Looking at the new fractions you cant compare without it so which one is actually bigger	8.0
	Because thats not true	1.0
	Look at these two 912 and 712 you have to compare the new fractions	1.0
	So youre comparing I dont like writing with a marker	1.0
	Can I borrow	1.0
	Youre comparing remember the new fraction of 912 and 712	1.0
	Which is bigger	8.0
	Nine or seven	8.0
	Yes so when youre doing this you have to rewrite the Just like we did here	1.0
	I agree with your answers	1.0
	Now rewrite this problem with our new fractions	1.0
	All right fifthgrader	1.0
	Im excited to be in here for some math today	1.0
	Our lesson builds off of the lesson youve had over the last couple of days about using read these words with me powers	2.0
Powers of 10	I want you to really do some thinking back to the last couple of days	1.0
	Today were going to be converting measurements in the metric system using what	8.0
Powers of 10	Powers of 10	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thats what our lesson is all about today	1.0
	Ladies would you please read the learning goal for us	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	I will	2.0
I will multiply and divide by powers of 10  in metric unit	Thats a lot of information isnt it	2.0
	The parts that are underlined thats whats really important in todays lesson	1.0
	Were going to be multiplying and dividing by powers of 10	1.0
	We did that the last couple of days	1.0
	Exponent Ball was the game you practiced that yesterday	1.0
	Were adding one more step to the multiplying and dividing by powers of 10 today	1.0
	Were going to be converting measurements in metric units	1.0
	Gentlemen we are going to read the success criteria today	1.0
	The success criteria has three steps	1.0
	When youre working on these problems today youre going to say Okay I have three steps I need to do in each of these problems	1.0
	Lets read the first one that starts with the word break	1.0
	Boys ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Break the problem in two parts	2.0
Break the problem in two parts	Determine how the units are related	2.0
Determine how the units are related	Name the rule using exponential notation	2.0
Name the rule using exponential notation	That last part means when you write down what the rule is instead of saying multiply by 100 youre going to say what is the power of 10 in X Exponential notation means what power of 10	8.0
	100 is what power	8.0
	10 to the	8.0
X2	Instead of saying the rule was multiplied by 100 youre going to say the rule was multiply by 102	5.0
	This is all things you can do its building off what weve learned over the last few days	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	This is our mental math	1.0
	What Id like for you to do is think through this question	1.0
	What rule or pattern can you use when you multiply or divide a whole number or decimals by power of 10	8.0
	For example and this was hard for me to write because I didnt know how to do powers of 10 on the Google slides	1.0
	The question is what if you had something like this	8.0
	30 7 what is that	8.0
	And	8.0
310	310	4.0
	Divided by 102	8.0
Power of 2	Thinking about what youve done the last couple of days what is the rule that you can remember to use for problems like that	8.0
	Or what if it was something like this	2.0
	Times 102	1.0
	You have a whiteboard in front of you	1.0
	You have a word bank on the front whiteboard	1.0
	The word bank says you might use words like backward forward smaller larger decimal shift which is another word for move	1.0
	Right left	1.0
	You might use some of these words	1.0
	These words are here to help you	1.0
	You can solve those if that helps you	1.0
	What I want you to do is write down what rule or pattern do we use when were multiplying and dividing by powers of 10	1.0
	You have a minute or two to do some writing and thinking	1.0
	Use this word bank	1.0
	This is were doing all everyone should be writing	1.0
	What rule or pattern can you use when you multiply or divide whole numbers or decimals by the power of 10	8.0
	Remember exponent ball	1.0
	Youre right but how do you know far to move it	8.0
	How do you know far to move the decimal	8.0
	How do you move the decimal	8.0
	How do you know how far to move the decimal	8.0
I just wanted to remove the point	Okay	1.0
	Right now this question is going to make you do some thinking why does that rule work	9.0
	Why does that rule work	9.0
	Those of you that are finishing your explanation I want you to start thinking about the next question why does that rule work	9.0
	Will it always work	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	You have 30 more seconds	1.0
	You will be sharing something from your whiteboard with your table mates	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I am seeing some amazing math thinking	1.0
	What Id like for you to do now is to find a place to stop and Id like you to please stand up	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen how we will be sharing our thinking is with the structure thats called roundrobin	1.0
	Any time we say something that that is round that means youre going around at your table group and anytime we say robin that means youre talking	1.0
	Were going to do whats called the single roundrobin where you go round your table group one time	1.0
	When you were done when all four people are done sharing I want you to sit down	1.0
	Thats my signal that youre done everyone has shared	1.0
	Now I want you to keep your marker out in  Heres why	1.0
	Someone on your team might say something that makes you go Oh yes If they do jot it down add it to your thinking	1.0
	Or if someone explains it in a different way and you think Oh that makes more sense to me	1.0
	Jot it down on your whiteboard	1.0
	Everyone should be standing up nice and tall	1.0
	Would you please wave at me if you are teammate number four	1.0
	Teammate number four youre going first	1.0
	Were going to do a reverse roundrobin	1.0
	Teammate four teammate three teammate two and then teammate one	1.0
	You need to share something all of whats on your whiteboard and then your team can comment	1.0
	I agree	1.0
	Oh I think you got most of it right	1.0
	Youre all standing	1.0
	Fletcher youre all standing	1.0
	Can you see the easel	1.0
	I want to remind you that there are some excellent phrases up here when youre commenting with your partners	1.0
	Like Id like to add on my thinking is similar except my thinking is different Id like to add on	1.0
	You have a lot of ways you can comment on your teammates thinking	1.0
	Our goal is four minutes	1.0
	I want you to try to give each person about one minute	1.0
	Ill be watching the clock	1.0
	Ill give you some reminders	1.0
	Wave at me if your teammate four	1.0
	Youre speaking first	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	If you dont have a four do a three	1.0
	Can you all hear him	2.0
No	No so start again because youre speaking to your whole group	5.0
	Speak up	1.0
When you multiply you make the number bigger so you attach the zeros behind the number you started with and then	For division	2.0
You move the decimal in front of the number you started with	Somebodys comment	3.0
	Look over here on the board	1.0
	What could we respond	3.0
I think you got most of it right and I would agree with  My thinking is similar because	How far do you move the decimal to the right	8.0
	How do you know how far or where to move the decimal	9.0
	How do you know	9.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen thank you for your amazing participation	1.0
	I saw lots of groups where kids were agreeing	1.0
	I saw a couple of places where kids are adding on to their thinking	1.0
	Would you please stand up and bring your whiteboard and marker to the carpet	1.0
	Do not erase it yet	1.0
	Would you please stand up and bring your whiteboard and marker to the carpet	1.0
	Aubrey would you head up to the desk please	2.0
	Right now you should be at the carpet and you should have your whiteboard	1.0
	You should be ready to do some thinking	1.0
	Ive asked Aubrey to come explain come up and show hers and you still have your marker so you can add on to yours while youre here	1.0
I showed this by showing the problems and turning the decimal moving to the left and to the right and then showing the answer	Aubrey right now you are the Mrs Travers	1.0
	I would like you to call on some classmates to respond from our math talk	2.0
Anna	Thanks for noticing that	1.0
I liked how you	Did Aubreys response explain the rule	2.0
	Aubrey would you read it to us one more time and I want everyone to be thinking does it accurately explain the rule	2.0
This occurs the same when you multiply but instead of left you shift the decimal to the right	Now Im going to really challenge you	1.0
	Aubrey Im going to have you leave yours up	1.0
	Everybody else please erase	1.0
	Heres the next question	1.0
	Why does this rule work	9.0
	Why does this rule work	9.0
	You can look at Aubreys and I want you to be thinking on your whiteboard now Why or how does this rule work	9.0
	Would it help to have some talk time	2.0
	Yes it works	1.0
	I know	1.0
	We did some great mouth thinking	1.0
	Are you thinking Aubrey	2.0
	Why does this rule work	9.0
	Doing some thinking when you divide and you move the decimal to the left it makes the quotient smaller	1.0
	Why	9.0
	When we multiply and we shift the decimal to the right our product becomes bigger	1.0
	Why	9.0
What is the answer to the quotient	Quotient is division product is multiplication	1.0
	I love how youre using math vocabulary	1.0
	The answer to a division problem is called a quotient	1.0
	The answer to a multiplication problem is called a product	1.0
	Ms James you have an amazing class	1.0
	I know	1.0
	I love them	1.0
	Look how everyone is thinking and even if theyre not writing I can tell that theyre thinking	1.0
	Why does that rule work	9.0
	Wherever youre sitting would you please turn so that you are in a team of two or three	1.0
Me to me	Me to me	1.0
We actually already have	If you already have a partner that you know who you work with at the carpet that is even better	1.0
	Okay if you have the shorter hair Id like you to speak first	1.0
	What is your new understanding about this rule and why or how the rule works	9.0
	Go	1.0
	Aubrey thank you for being so brave and so willing to share your thinking with our class	1.0
	We really appreciate it	1.0
	Would you please close your conversation in three two one zero	1.0
	Anyone willing to start our conversation about why or how the rule works	9.0
	Jon thank you	2.0
This rule works because when multiplying youre moving the decimal point to the right making your number bigger	Making the product bigger	5.0
	Yes and why does it work shifting the decimal to the left for division	9.0
It makes it smaller	Good	1.0
	Riley	2.0
when you are multiplying  and when youre moving the decimal to the right it makes the whole number larger	Exactly	1.0
	Smart thinking friends	1.0
	My friends we are going to do a couple of mental math problems on our whiteboard while were here	1.0
	I know you have done some amazing thinking on your whiteboard and I want to value your work	1.0
	You may erase it	1.0
	I know	1.0
	Think about all the amazing thinking youve already done so far	1.0
	Ms James this is where I will need to just be on this actual mental math for today	1.0
	How do you get to it usually	8.0
	All right my friends here we go	1.0
	These are what we just talked about	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Were going to move pretty quickly now	1.0
	We have 500102	1.0
	Were just going to write it	1.0
	Write your quotient	1.0
	Think about where you will be moving the decimal point	1.0
	Will it shift to the left or the right	8.0
Left	How many places will the decimal shift	8.0
	Say it	2.0
Two	You got it	1.0
	Please check your own whiteboard right now	1.0
	Is this your new quotient	2.0
Yes	Were checking our own whiteboards right now	1.0
	Heres your next problem	1.0
	31102	1.0
	Think to yourself	1.0
	Will my decimal	1.0
	be moving to the right or the left which way friends	8.0
Right	Right	1.0
	How many place values	8.0
Two	Please check your board right now the answer is 310	1.0
	Your new product	1.0
	15103	1.0
	Check your own board please	1.0
	Answer is 15000	1.0
	Well just do a couple more to get our brains warmed up and ready for today	1.0
	373 102	1.0
	I wonder if weve already seen this problem today	2.0
	Thats right got it	1.0
	373102	1.0
	May I show you a little strategy	2.0
	Ms James probably shows you amazing strategies too	1.0
	My friends are we going to be moving the decimal	2.0
	Are we shifting it to the left or to the right	8.0
Left	To the left	5.0
	Im just gonna write that down because division means shift to the left were making our quotient smaller	1.0
	How many places do I shift the decimal	8.0
	Say it	2.0
Two	Have you tried the hops	1.0
	This helps me one two	1.0
	Thats where I know that I needed to shift it two places	1.0
	Have you guys used the hops before	2.0
	It helps me so much	1.0
	What is our new answer	8.0
	Lets read it together	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
0373	You guys are amazing	1.0
	Im going to give you two this time	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	One and two	1.0
	I like using the hops	1.0
	Its helpful to me	1.0
	Hold up your hand if you need a little more time	1.0
	Lets check	1.0
	Please check the board	1.0
	Your first product is 80800 and your quotient is 110	1.0
	Heres a challenge	1.0
	Look at all these smart math thinkers Ms James	1.0
	If I could see the inside of their brain we would see synapses going	1.0
	Alright just a quick check	1.0
	Its okay if youre not all the way done these ones are a little more challenging	1.0
	Get our brains really thinking this morning	1.0
	Please erase your whiteboard	1.0
	Its okay	1.0
	My friends I want to remind you were going to go back to our seats in just a moment	1.0
	We are going to complete problem 1 on journal page 201 but I have to remind you of todays success criteria	1.0
	Remember every time we solve problems today hold up three fingers	1.0
	Show me three fingers right now	1.0
	Every time you solve problems today our success is we have three steps	1.0
	I want to hear your voices first step is what	8.0
Break the problem into parts	Second step	8.0
Determine how the units are related	Third step	8.0
Make a rule using exponential notation	Instead of saying we multiplied by 1000 you would say we multiply by 103	1.0
	Now when it says determine how the units are related youre going to have some problems today that say things like how many millimeters are in one centimeter	1.0
	How many millimeters are in one meter	1.0
	Thats what I mean by determine how the units are related	1.0
	How many millimeters are in one meter	1.0
	Thats what I mean by units	1.0
	Youre going to go ahead and put your whiteboards away	1.0
	You are going to solve problem 1 on journal page 201	1.0
	Were going to start by solving by ourselves	1.0
	Go	1.0
	There is a pen on the carpet if somebody left a white pen with a blue lid	1.0
	Do we have someone thats already on page 201 problem 1	2.0
	Ms James let me see here	1.0
	Wow look at this team back here	1.0
	Were almost there page 201	1.0
	This is your math mesIvy	1.0
	Problem 1 page 201	1.0
	Im watching the clock	1.0
	Im going to give you about two minutes	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Just Problem number one	1.0
	Just problem number one	1.0
	Check the front board if youre not sure what to do right now	1.0
	Math mesIvy one	1.0
	Just thought Id wake you up this morning	1.0
	Fletcher youre going to have a partner activity with the rest of the page so please dont go on	1.0
	Remember our steps	1.0
	We want to make sure that we are breaking it into parts thinking about the units and answering with a rule using what powers of	8.0
10	10	4.0
	Did you answer with powers of 10	2.0
Oh	Make sure your rule is expressed using powers of 10 or exponents	1.0
	Jack would you mind sharing with us what is this problem asking us to do	8.0
Its asking us what are the rules	We need to figure out the rule	5.0
	What information do we have to help us get started	8.0
We have the first problem we solved for the first part	The first part of the rule so tell us what that means	8.0
that	In one meter we have how many centimeters	8.0
A 100	Class	2.0
100	100 so if we had 2 meters how many centimeters would we have	8.0
200	Help me out	1.0
	Were going to keep going three meters	8.0
300	Four meters	8.0
400	Five meters	8.0
500	What was the rule or pattern	8.0
	Anyone willing to share	2.0
Times 102	Oh I saw a lot of kids write times 100	1.0
	How did you know it was times 10 multiplied by time 102 tell us your thinking	9.0
Because I saw that we are adding up	That means we would be shifting the decimal two places to the right making the product bigger	1.0
	Amazing math thinking	1.0
	We shifted the decimal two places to the right	1.0
	We are multiplying our rule is times 102	1.0
	I love your hand signals is that showing you agree	3.0
	Amazing math thinking	1.0
	Friends that just gets us started with todays math thinking	1.0
	Please put your pencils down	1.0
	I see some of you are going so fast and I love that but you have a job on the rest of this page	1.0
	You will be doing Ivy and scribe on problems 2 and 3	1.0
	What do you know about Ivy and scribe	8.0
	Have we done it before	2.0
Yes	Im thinking so	1.0
	Pencils down	1.0
	Pencils down	1.0
	Would you please stand up right now go find the partnerT2asked you to partner up with earlier today and I want you to stand up with that partner with your journal and pencil	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Stand up	1.0
	Find your partner for math today	1.0
	My friends would you please put your pencils down	1.0
	Gentlemen and ladies Id like your pencils down	1.0
	Remember we talked about active listening really really listening this morning	1.0
	We are looking at the metric system today	1.0
	Have you ever noticed that there are different ways to measure for example some people use inches some people use centimeters	1.0
	Have you noticed that	2.0
	Please put your pencils down	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	The metric system is the measuring system that most of the world uses	1.0
	Scientists and most countries in the world use the metric system but in the United States we use US customary	1.0
	Do I know why	2.0
	Not really but most science math and other countries use metric	1.0
	We will almost always be using metric when were studying math	1.0
	That means millimeters centimeters kilometers liters kilograms kilometers	1.0
	Thats the system were using	1.0
	Everything in the metric system is based on 10s powers of 10	1.0
	Take a peek at our front whiteboard	1.0
	When centimeters are divided by 102 the decimal point shifts two places to the what	8.0
Left	Left	4.0
	The digits and then if you are multiplying by powers of 10 the digits shift two places to the right	1.0
	In the metric system the whole metric system is based on powers of 10	1.0
	I just wanted you to be aware of that	1.0
	You have a job with this partner you are just looking at my hands	1.0
	Were just solving numbers	1.0
One	It should say two and three not one and two	1.0
	You are just solving numbers two and numbers three	1.0
	This should say number two and this should say number three	1.0
	One of you if you are the scribe you are the writer if you are the Ivy you are the	1.0
Talker	Explainer youre the Mrs Travers	1.0
	Then on number three the other person partner B will be the scribe and partner A will be the Ivy	1.0
	That means you wont have both problems completed	1.0
	If youre partner A youre only answering number two only number two will be filled out in your book	1.0
	If you are partner B the other partner only number three will be filled out in your book because we are practicing listening	1.0
	Really listen to your Ivy and how your Ivy helps you solve	1.0
	Maya will you read  what it says in red at the bottom	2.0
	When you finish number two and three youre going to flip to math boxes	1.0
	Thats howT3and I will know youre done and youre ready for the next step	1.0
	If youre stuck there are three questions you and your partner can ask each other	1.0
	They are on the board	1.0
	What problems are you solving right now	2.0
Two	Two and Three	5.0
	If you have the lighter color shoes you are the scribe for number two	1.0
	Youre solving number two	1.0
	If you have the darker colored shoes you are solving number three	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Whos two on this problem	2.0
	Faith youre explainin number two	1.0
	Ivy is the talker	1.0
	We are converting between centimeters and millimeters	1.0
	What do we know Aaron	8.0
	We know theres	8.0
We know if you have 1 is equals to	Think back to Remember our success criteria where our rule has to be expressed in a power of	1.0
Oh yes	Youre right	1.0
	So far do we think Aaron is right	3.0
	47 so its 10 to	8.0
To power of	If you move the decimal one place	8.0
To the power of one	How do you know that	9.0
	Go back to Faith	1.0
I know  to the power of 1 because youre adding one 0 and then moving the decimal point one place over	Is you product larger or smaller	8.0
Larger	You move the decimal one place to there	1.0
	Now Aaron you are the Ivy and youre explaining number three to Faith	1.0
Yes	Okay here we go	1.0
	Aaron why dont you read that for us	2.0
The rule is	If we look at	1.0
	All your decimals are right here and youre dividing by 10	1.0
	Where do they go now	8.0
	Is our outbox getting bigger or smaller	8.0
	What do you think Faith	8.0
This is 2	How did you know	9.0
	If you start with 1000 and your answer is 1 is our answer larger or smaller	8.0
Smaller	When you divide youre dividing something into pieces and its getting smaller	5.0
dividing to the power of three	10 to the third power	2.0
Yes	What do you need to fix	8.0
	There we go right	2.0
	Now what	2.0
	If you were doing  hops you would move the hops right one two three places	1.0
	You guys are doing great	1.0
	Keep going	1.0
	Can I help you guys	2.0
	Lets think about if you know youre dividing by 10 to the third power youre going to be moving the decimal how many places	8.0
Two	Which way left or right	8.0
Left	If right now the decimals is right here were going to move it one two three	1.0
	Whats your new answer	8.0
	Because we made this smaller	1.0
	Now were going to have to reverse it going this way	1.0
	Our goal is to read and listen to each other to help each other understand	1.0
	You could help her be the Ivy and you guys do need to solve these  too	1.0
	Whats the rule	8.0
	Talk through how do you know that this is 8000	9.0
You know this is 8000 because	Use this name tag right here	1.0
	Heres the decimal	1.0
	tenths hundredths thousandths three places to get right to the decimal	1.0
	We divided by 10 to this	1.0
	Now we need to multiply	1.0
	This is ones tens hundreds thousands places right here	1.0
	Are you doing multiplying	2.0
	All the other places	1.0
	You are going to have a sevendigit number	1.0
I put zeros in front of it	Seven digits	1.0
	Nine in the thousands	1.0
Just remember when you multiply	One in the hundredths	1.0
	Where is the hundredths	8.0
	If thats your decimal where is the hundredths	8.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	Thats tens	1.0
	Here hundredths is right here	1.0
Equals 0 0 8	Were in the tens not tenths tens so thats right here	1.0
Did you say zero	Eight in the thousandths which is way over here and 2s in all the other places	1.0
	In here	1.0
	920	1.0
	Is there something in the	2.0
	Okay that should be a 2	1.0
Do we do page	Have you figured out what the rule is	2.0
Yes	Times 10	1.0
	1 times 10 is 10	1.0
Fill in the circle next to the best answer	Youre moving the decimal one place right	2.0
	If youre moving it one place to the right were going to reverse it one place to the left	1.0
Its 1	50 youre going to have the decimal	1.0
	If this is where the decimal is right now we want to move that one place to the left	1.0
	This is where the decimal is right now	1.0
	We need to move it one place to the left	1.0
	If this is where the decimal is right now we need to move it one place to the left	1.0
	Pam	2.0
Pam pam	Awesome job fifth graders	1.0
	I need you to please bring your journal and pencil to the carpet	1.0
	Quickly and quietly	1.0
	Go	1.0
Miss Vance can we just leave these here	Yes okay	1.0
	Awesome job coming quickly	1.0
Everybody freeze	Why is this doing this	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Okay we are going to take a quick look at the answer key	1.0
	Mrs Travers is getting back in math mode back into fifth grade mode is really what I mean to do	1.0
	I want to get back to every day math right	2.0
	Yes escape	1.0
	I dont know why its	1.0
	Are you comfortable drawing somewhere so its a triangle	1.0
	Erase	1.0
	Its trying to erase it	1.0
	Yes I thought about it	1.0
	I just want to show them how to relate the answer key	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right my friends if you could please take a quick look up here on the screen	1.0
	I want you to check your thinking	1.0
	I stopped by a couple of kids desks and we were talking about is the rule multiply times 10	1.0
	That is correct but we talked about in our success criteria we need to have our rule be written as a what	8.0
	Power of	8.0
10	I want you to check your rules	1.0
	Do you have times 10 to the first power	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	If you dont I asked you to bring your pencils so you can check it right now please okay	2.0
	Then my friends in number three the rule would be divided by 10 to the what	8.0
Power of three	Third power	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Would you please check your number two and your number three that you have with your partner right now	2.0
	Miss Vance and I would like you to do number four by yourself and this is what its going to show us	1.0
	Were going to take a quick check and were going to say okay some of our classmates might need more practice with this and thats okay	1.0
	Some of our classmates might have this right now and thats okay too	1.0
	Were going to ask you to do number four by yourself so that we can know are you one of those kiddos that needs a few more minutes of practice with a Mrs Travers or with a partner or are you one of those kiddos thats ready to keep going with this on your own	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Would you please bring your book to your desk and would you please solve number four by yourself	2.0
	When you are done with number four	1.0
Thats 20000	Is it	2.0
	Milli is a prefix that means 1000	1.0
	Centi is the prefix that means 100	1.0
	Milligram there must be what	8.0
100000	There are 1000	1.0
	If milli means thousand how many milligrams are there in a gram	8.0
100000	100000	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	When youre done with number four please do a quick hand raise and Miss Vance and I will give you your next steps	1.0
	Im going to start from 1 gram to 1000 milligrams	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
	Thats what we know	1.0
	We know that were converting milligrams to grams	1.0
	Write down milligrams grams	1.0
We need to read the directions	Yes	1.0
	What do we know	8.0
	We know its milligrams to grams and how many milligrams are in one gram	8.0
	100000	1.0
	You need to know that	1.0
	1000 milligrams 1 gram	1.0
	Thats what you need for the problem	1.0
	Okay	1.0
Okay	You are on the right track but milligrams are tiny grams so my hint to you is first this is 1 milligram is 1000 not 10	1.0
	Thats going to change this	1.0
	I also want you to know that this is going to be a smaller number because were starting with big and were moving Miss Vance what do you think about this	1.0
	She just reversed it	1.0
	Thats what a lot of them are doing	1.0
	I think thats okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Right	1.0
	This would be 10 to the third right	2.0
	Right	1.0
	You just did it the opposite way which is fine you still get	1.0
	I think thats fine right	1.0
	They do need to flip it	1.0
	They need to go	1.0
	We need to be doing this as a division not a multiplication	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You have the right thinking but were dividing not multiplying	1.0
	Come right back	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ive seen a lot of them	1.0
	Theyre not reading this	1.0
No I didnt read it	Miss Vances class we need to have a quick commercial break	1.0
	I used to always have to do this with my fifth graders	1.0
	Theres a couple of little tips that I think if Miss Vance and I give you these couple of little tips its going to help you a little bit okay	2.0
	Friends I want you to look up here	1.0
	We are going from milligrams 43 milligrams is how many grams	8.0
	Milligrams are teeny tiny	1.0
	How many milligrams are in a gram	8.0
	There are 1000 milligrams in 1 gram	1.0
	This is what your rule would start out as okay	2.0
	Then because were going from milligrams to grams we are going to be dividing	1.0
	1000 is 10 to what power	8.0
Third	10 the the third power	5.0
	Thats all Im going to show you up there so that that can help you	1.0
	Miss Vance and I are now ready to check	1.0
	When youre ready for us to look at your answer youll raise your hand high and well give you your next step	1.0
I think were multiplying	Thats why I wanted to show that to you	1.0
I dont think this will have to do anything	Yes move on to the next page	1.0
Oh okay	Were doing page 202	1.0
	202	1.0
	Miss Vance 202 is the next job	1.0
	202	1.0
	202	1.0
	The next page	1.0
	You may move on to the next page	1.0
	You may move on to the next page	1.0
	This is what you have 43 milligrams	1.0
	Youre using this number right here	1.0
	Thats the problem youre solving	1.0
	I dont know you mightve got it right	1.0
	Erase this and put a 43 right here	1.0
	Then youre going to come up with the out	1.0
	If youre dividing it by 10 to the power of 3	8.0
Howd you	Yes but what goes right here is this	1.0
Okay	Thats the problem were solving	1.0
	How many grams are in 43 milligrams	8.0
	Put your answer here	1.0
	Youre close	1.0
	May I see your pencil	1.0
	If you wrote 43 milligrams how many places are you moving the decimal	8.0
	Right or left	8.0
	One two three	1.0
	Youre only going to have one zero not two	1.0
	Youre welcome	1.0
	Yes move on to page 202	1.0
	Yes move on to page 202	1.0
	Hi Owen	1.0
Then just move it 3 to the left	Were just about going to	1.0
	I know were just about ready to	1.0
	This is what goes here because theyre saying how many grams are in 43 milligrams	8.0
	This is your answer	1.0
	You have it you just dont have it in the right place	1.0
	You are super close	1.0
	I want to show you something	1.0
	Do you see how this has 20 to the third power	2.0
	If this is what youre starting with 43 and the decimals right here we need to go like this	1.0
	One two three and now the decimals here	1.0
	Youre new answer is	1.0
	See why	2.0
	Do you see how I did that	2.0
	Were moving the decimal three places to the left	1.0
	Good	1.0
	You can move on to the next page	1.0
	How many centimeters are in a meter	8.0
	Centi means 100 and you also have a little cheat sheet right here in the front of your book	1.0
	Centi mean 100	1.0
	Bumbadabumbum	2.0
Bumbum	Ms Vances class I have to tell you I am so proud of the incredible math thinking weve had in here today	1.0
	Youre job right now is to take a pause from math	1.0
	Put your pencil in your book and close it	1.0
	Were going to do a little activity to get our bodies moving	1.0
	Then youll get your snack	1.0
We have to go get our snacks and	I know	1.0
One two three clap	If you can hear me clap once	1.0
	If you can hear me clap twice	1.0
	If you can hear me clap three times	1.0
	Now were going to do a little activity with standing clapping and partnering	1.0
	Would you please stand up and find your same partner that you were with for Ivy and scribe	1.0
	You dont need to bring anything its not math	1.0
	You have five seconds to find your partner and I want to see you with a high ten like this	1.0
	Ready go	1.0
	Youre going to need some space	1.0
	Youre going to need some space	1.0
	This is to get our brains moving and have some fun	1.0
	We all know that we can count to three	1.0
	One two three	1.0
Aaron cant	Well guess what	2.0
	Ms Vance and I are going to show you an activity	1.0
	Have you done this yet	1.0
	Yes we did it in	1.0
	I know but has the class done it	1.0

	Ready go	1.0
	Im ready for you Logan	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen would you please bring your conversations to a close	1.0
	Excellent and now I want you to determine for todays work who will be partner A and who will be partner B	1.0
	Sometimes A will go first sometimes B will go first and if you have three people you will have two people be the A today	1.0
	Figure that out you have 10 seconds	1.0
	Who will be A who will be B	1.0
	Three two one and zero	1.0
	My friends can I have everybody please take your bodies and move them off the carpet so we can all see the question thats on the board	1.0
	This is our warmup this is a way that teachers call it building rapport	1.0
	Making you feel good and comfortable with the person youre about to work with	1.0
	Our question is if you could go anywhere right now for 30 minutes and not have any responsibility	1.0
	You wouldnt have to care of a sibling you wouldnt have to do homework you wouldnt have to read	1.0
	You can do whatever you wanted for 30 minutes anywhere you wanted for 30 minutes where would you go and why	1.0
	If you are partner A you are going to share first and then partner B youre going to respond	1.0
	Then partner B youre going share second and partner A you will respond	1.0
	Im going to tell you when 30 seconds is up and then when the minute is up so that you can keep track of your time	1.0
	If theres someone who would model do an example with me	1.0
	Kevin come on up	1.0
	Im going to pretend like Im partner A youre partner B so do this	1.0
	Good morning	1.0
Good morning	If I could go anywhere for 30 minutes and not have any responsibilities right now if I could magically transport somewhere Id like to go skiing by myself	1.0
Why	Because I love skiing but lately when I go skiing its with my daughter and so I dont get to really ski hard like I like to ski	1.0
	Thats what I would do for 30 minutes if I could have no responsibilities and do whatever I wanted	1.0
	What would you do	1.0
I would go to Fiji to surf	That sounds amazing have you been there	1.0
No but Ive been surfing a lot	Really	1.0
	Where have you been surfing	1.0
Off the coast of North Carolina	Awesome	1.0
	Fiji sounds like a great place	1.0
	I would agree something like that on the beach with the ocean thatd be my close second	1.0
	Thanks for being my partner	1.0
	Now were going to get our materials and we are going to go get started working today	1.0
	My friends find your thinking partner and partner A your 30 seconds starts now	1.0
	Let me know when youre ready	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen that was 30 seconds switch partner	1.0
	The other person talks	1.0
	All right please bring your conversation to a close	1.0
	Thank you for sharing	1.0
	I love hearing going around	1.0
	I heard someone in here would just like to stay in the classroom and have freerunning time in the class	1.0
	Heres your job	1.0
	First youre probably going to need to go back to your own desk	1.0
	Youre going to need to clear hang on freeze youre going to need to clear everything because someone else might be sitting in your desk in a few minutes	1.0
	I want your desk nice and clean and clear	1.0
	Youre going to get these materials	1.0
	Pencil math journals whiteboard marker then you and your thinking partner are going to sit by each other at a table group shoulder to shoulder	1.0
	Clear or cloudy	2.0
Clear as the sky	Are you clear	2.0
Yes	All right go	1.0
	You have about 10 seconds to be in your new seat next to your new partner	1.0
	You have about five seconds to be in your seat next to your new partner	1.0
	All right this is what youre going to do with the little carvings youre getting from the back of the room today	1.0
	This is todays lesson my friends	1.0
	Using displacement to measure volume	1.0
	Yes I can call the funny faces	1.0
	Using displacement to measure volume	1.0
	Let those words keep on marinating in your head right now	1.0
	If youre partner A would you please stand up	1.0
	Partner A would you please read todays learning target	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
Today we will use the displacement method to measure the volume of objects	Okay think about that for a moment	1.0
	Partner B please stand up	1.0
	This is our success criteria today	1.0
	Partner B please read it	2.0
I will explain why displacement method works for measuring volume	Great	1.0
	Thats a lot of empty words	1.0
	Well talk about displacement in a minute but what I want you to talk about first is this what is volume	1.0
	You should have your whiteboard and watching the clock	1.0
	Id like you to write down fast and furious if youre wrong or right what do you know about volume	1.0
	You have 30 seconds go	1.0
	On the whiteboard because this is where youre supposed to be doing that	1.0
	On your whiteboard what is volume	1.0
	A picture some words definition you have 20 seconds	1.0
	Use your whiteboard	1.0
	All right you may have your marker still ready	1.0
	Id like for you to please stand up at your table groups	1.0
	Were going to do whats called a round drop hit	1.0
	A single round drop and that means one time around everyone will share something they have written down on their whiteboard	1.0
	You might have a management at your group	1.0
	If you do start at teammate number one then two then three then four you might have a five	1.0
	I want to hear everybody share something that  on their whiteboard and then be ready to share something youve heard in your group	1.0
	If someone in your team says something and you think Yes thats a great idea jot it down	1.0
	So have your markers ready and have your tables listening	1.0
	Is everyone standing	1.0
	Please stand	1.0
	When youre done sharing please sit	1.0
	Thats how Mr Bayer and I will know that everyone has shared	1.0
	Raise your hand if youre teammate one in your group	1.0
	Youre starting	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	If youve shared you may sit down	1.0
	Okay well Im going to pull a couple of sticks I want you to share something you heard at your group	1.0
	What is volume	8.0
	Nora	2.0
It is length times width times height	Im going to teach you something new here	1.0
	I think weve done something like this before	1.0
	If you agree youre going to stand up	1.0
	If you dont agree you stay seated so everybody has to be really listening and everybody has to be ready to respond	1.0
	Nora would you say that one more time please	2.0
The volume is length times width times height	Okay thank you sit down	1.0
	Another person	2.0
	Ellie	2.0
	I dont know which one this is	1.0
	Okay	1.0
The inside of an object	The inside of an object	4.0
	Take off or stay seated	1.0
	Do you agree with that explanation of volume	3.0
	Okay great touch down	1.0
	Sit down	1.0
	Aria	2.0
Volume is the amount of space an object takes up	Volume is the amount of space an object takes up	4.0
	Right touch down	1.0
	Victoria	2.0
The measurement inside an object	The measurement inside an object	4.0
	Are we taking off	1.0
	Are we standing up	1.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Naomi	2.0
Its	Volume is	8.0
Volume is also base times height	Area of the base times height	5.0
	Stand up	1.0
	Okay great	1.0
	Well do one more	1.0
	Touch down	1.0
	Logan what do we know about volume	8.0
Its the space that an object takes up	The space that an object takes up is what I heard Logan say	5.0
	Excellent thank you	1.0
	Okay my friends touch down	1.0
	I heard some great ideas about volume	1.0
	What we want to think about is that there are a couple of different ways to come up with volume	1.0
	Usually when we think about volume we think about this	1.0
	Like this	1.0
	The amount of space that a 3D object takes up	1.0
	This is a rectangular prism or a cube	1.0
	Did you guys do something on volume yesterday	2.0
Yes	The volume would be how many cubic centimeters would fit inside this cube	1.0
	Thats volume its how much space this takes up	1.0
	Do we know	8.0
A thousand	A thousand how did we know	8.0
Base times height	Area of the base so the area of the bottom times the height because theres layers	5.0
	There will be layers of cubes inside here	1.0
	The one layer will be the area of the base and then we have 10 of those layers to make the volume	1.0
	This will be full of 1000 cubes	1.0
	Do we agree with that	3.0
	Yes	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	I just answered some of those questions	1.0
	Heres what were going to do	1.0
	Partner A I want you to find the volume of this partner B youre going to respond would you find it the same way	3.0
	This is a cube or a rectangular prism how would you find the volume of this rectangular prism	8.0
	Partner A youre starting partner B you are responding	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Three two one zero voices	1.0
	Again I heard some great conversation I want to hear from just a couple of you	1.0
	Sarah	2.0
area of the base times height	Why	9.0
Because its quite easy	Its efficient quick and easy to find the area of the base	5.0
	How would you do that	8.0
Length of the bottom times	Length times width	5.0
Times width	Then times the height	2.0
Yes	Okay excellent	1.0
	Then I just picked Jade	1.0
	How would you find the volume of this	8.0
I would multiply the area of the base multiplied by the height	Right so will that trend always work when you have a rectangular prism or a cube	2.0
Yes	It will but I want to really challenge your thinking right now	1.0
	You see that top picture up there	2.0
Yes	Which one of you ever played croquet	2.0
	Do you know what croquet is	2.0
	Croquet is this little backyard game where you have a mallet and you have these balls and theyre a little bit heavy and you hit them through a goalpost	1.0
	I got really lucky because Mr Ms Travers my husband he teaches fifth grade and he just taught this lesson the other day and he said Mrs Ms Travers we are supposed to do this lesson with oranges	1.0
	He said You dont want to go to the store and buy oranges just use the croquet balls we got	1.0
	I said Okay	1.0
	He did it he said it worked really well so yes were going to use croquet balls instead of oranges	1.0
	We know we have some strategies for trying to get the volume of a prism	1.0
	A question for you could we use the same strategy for finding the volume of a croquet ball	2.0
	Im going to pass a couple around you so you can feel them	1.0
	Could we use the same strategy for finding the volume of a croquet ball	2.0
	You have a thinking partner	1.0
	This time partner B is starting first	1.0
	Partner B what are your thoughts about how will we find the volume of this ball	8.0
	Partner A you will respond	2.0
	Go	2.0
	All right please close your partner station	1.0
	This time I am going to take some volunteers	1.0
	I dont usually do hands up and that because I love to just hear what kids are thinking but this is a new idea	1.0
	What are some of your ideas with this croquet ball	8.0
	Can we use the same strategy length times width times height to find the volume of the croquet ball	2.0
	What are your thoughts	8.0
	Ally Ive not heard from you yet today	1.0
You probably could but it might be a little harder because the base area might be like right here on the bottom it might not be the same height or the same width as the whole	Im hearing you say there probably is a formula of some sort to find the volume but it might be a little different because it doesnt have a base the same way a prism does	5.0
	Yes	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lydia please call on someone to add on or to share some different thinking	2.0
Because of this round size were thinking we wouldnt really be able to find the	A different method	1.0
Yes its round so its a lot harder to find the length and width	Could you call someone else to add on	2.0
We kind of thought that it wouldnt work	When you say it what do you mean by it	8.0
The strategies	To find the volume	2.0
If theres lines on the croquet balls we thought wed count the lines and those would be like layers and how many cubes	Were going from thinking about how would we find the volume of this	8.0
	We are kind of leading into that	1.0
	I want you to do some thinking right now and the same conversation with your partner	1.0
	How could we find the volume	8.0
	Well call this a prism	1.0
	A croquet ball its a prism	1.0
	A sphere	2.0
A sphere	A sphere	4.0
	Talk to your partner go	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	May I have your croquet ball please	1.0
	All right good friends thank you for sharing your great ideas	1.0
	Im going to go ahead and ask you to turn your eyes up to the front whiteboard	1.0
	Do you have your whiteboard in front of you	1.0
Yes	Clear it off	1.0
	Today were going to learn a new method for finding volumes	1.0
	The method is called the displacement method	1.0
	Say displacement	2.0
Displacement	On your whiteboard displacement	1.0
	The root word is displace	1.0
	Even displace has a prefix dis	1.0
	The root word is place	1.0
	What do you think that word means	8.0
	Displacement	1.0
To share	Quick ideas	1.0
	Lets just do some quick ideas	1.0
	Aria	2.0
Maybe to put something in the wrong spot	If you displace something like I displaced my car keys I cant find them	1.0
	Right	1.0
Yes	All right Ellie	2.0
Maybe if youre playing with Legos and you put it in the wrong spot	Interesting	1.0
	Are you thinking dis might mean wrong	2.0
Yes	Okay anything else	8.0
	Anything different	3.0
	Jack	2.0
I know that dis it sounds like misplace though its different so it has almost the same meaning	Dis is similar to mis misplace displace	5.0
	My friends were actually going to be displacing some water with an object	1.0
	Everyone will get an opportunity to do this today	1.0
	Eyes back upfront	1.0
	Today were going to displace objects of water to measure the volume of objects	1.0
	I have some pitchers	1.0
	I actually need to pour some of this water	1.0
	Ms Bayer can you help me pour the water back out back into one of these pitchers so that theres just water at the zero mark	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	My friends what were going to do today is we have a croquet ball and we have a pitcher its a container well call it a pitcher of water	1.0
	Im going to put the croquet ball in the water	1.0
	What do you think is going to happen	8.0
	Based on what you know water does	1.0
	I love this conversation	1.0
	Okay three two one zero	1.0
	Guess what Ive already done some of the work for you	1.0
	You need to open up to page 214	1.0
214 or 215	214 I believe	1.0
214	214	1.0
	May I borrow yours for a minute Maya	1.0
	Thank you Parker	1.0
	My friends when you look on page 214 youre going to see the directions	1.0
	Ive already done some of the directions for you so that we didnt have to use our thinking our learning time making the container	1.0
	Were going to scroll all the way down	1.0
	Ms Bayer just did number seven for us	1.0
	She poured the water out of the bottle until the water was back at zero	1.0
	Right now we have this	1.0
	We have a twoliter container	1.0
	Our container is marked with our measuring tool	1.0
	That means it is to scale	1.0
	This is the scale we are using to measure the volume	1.0
	Our water is up here at the zero mark right now	1.0
	Im going to put the croquet ball in the bottle	1.0
	Dont say anything out loud right now	1.0
	Thats what Im going to do	1.0
	You have this right here	1.0
	I believe you have a prediction	1.0
	This is our calibrated bottle that weve created	1.0
	This is our tool for measuring volume	1.0
	Were measuring how much space the croquet ball takes up in the water	1.0
	Thats what volume is	1.0
	How do you think this tool could be used to find the volume of My friends in your book do you see where it says orange	2.0
	Cross out orange write the word ball	1.0
	Im not using an orange Im using a croquet ball	1.0
	From the math message this is the math message	1.0
	What is going to happen when I put the croquet ball in the bottle	8.0
	Write your prediction go	1.0
	Start with  thats why we always have two teachers in here  three days in	1.0
	Im sorry whos journal did I take	1.0
	Jack you can go take it back	1.0
	You may go write your own prediction	1.0
	Yes you could freeze it	1.0
How do you freeze it	I got it	1.0
You just press	The calibrated bottle is your tool for measuring volume	1.0
	How can we use this tool to find the volume of our croquet ball	8.0
	What is going to happen when we put the croquet ball in the model	8.0
	Write it	1.0
	Though Im going to be calling kids to share their prediction	1.0
	You have a prediction	2.0
	I think	1.0
	How will we find volume	8.0
	All right friends you have your same thinking partner	1.0
	Partner A youre speaking first	2.0
	Youre going to read your prediction partner B responds	8.0
	Partner B you read your prediction partner A responds	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay and three two one zero	1.0
	Thank you for bringing your voices back to zero	1.0
	Lets hear a couple of predictions	1.0
	Pete	2.0
	Adam	2.0
I thought that the water would rise because the croquet ball would take away space from it so it forces the water to spread out kind of	Do you think you might agree with that prediction	3.0
	Please stand	1.0
	Okay touch back down	1.0
	Lets hear a couple more	1.0
	Maya	2.0
I think the water will rise and show on the scale how much it rises	Maya said I think the water will rise and it will show on the scale how much the water will rise	5.0
	Would you please stand if you agree	3.0
	Okay touch down	1.0
	Well hear one more	1.0
	Brielle	2.0
We know that we started at zero and then well count how much it rose	My friends do you see	2.0
	Maybe if youre in those far groups you may stand	1.0
	If youre in these three groups right here would you please just turn your chair so we could see here	1.0
	My friends I have the container is marked at the yellow	1.0
	Im going to show you a couple of objects and youre going to be doing a couple on your own back here	1.0
	Pay attention how Im doing this now	1.0
	The yellow mark the yellow tape is zero	1.0
	Thats our measurement for zero	1.0
	Im going to put in the croquet ball	1.0
	Just like some of our predictions were going to see what happens	1.0
	The water is going to rise	1.0
	How high the water rises will tell us how much space this croquet ball takes up which is what word	8.0
	It starts with a V	4.0
Volume	Ready	2.0
It floats	Its between 100 and 200 milliliters	1.0
	Close to 200	1.0
	What would you say Adam	8.0
	I liked your estimate	1.0
175	175 milliliters write it down	1.0
	You have a place right here	1.0
	Record the volume	1.0
	Cross out orange again its a croquet ball	1.0
	Record the volume of the croquet ball	1.0
	175 milliliters	1.0
	That means that croquet ball is equal to 175 milliliters	1.0
	Maya did you want to add something	3.0
I noticed that the ball is floating is it still taking up volume of the whole area	Volume	2.0
	That whole volume up since its not completely in the water	2.0
	You know what Im going to have you do Im going to have you hang on to that question right here because you are going to measure some other objects today	1.0
	I just think you can answer your own question by the end of the lesson okay	2.0
Okay	All right	1.0
	Emma Im going to have you put your hand down	1.0
	Ms Bayer would you mind unfreezing and showing us the next page	1.0
	Were going to keep going	1.0
	Jack can you go put your board up	1.0
	Sorry Ms Bayer Im actually going to have him put the	1.0
Sorry	I need page 215 under the top counter	1.0
	Thank you for being my second and third teacher	1.0
Of course	My friends so we all have this recorded	1.0
	What about a flat	8.0
	What about base 10 flat	8.0
	Could we use the same volume method	2.0
Maybe	Partner A read number one for us	2.0
	In your journal its also on the screen	1.0
	Raise your hand if youre an A	2.0
	Youre reading number one	1.0
	Go	2.0
Record the volumes in volume	In milliliters	1.0
Column of the table below	My friends Im going to tell you a hint	1.0
	Milliliters Im going to put these down and were going to see what happens in milliliters ready	2.0
	Heres one base 10 flat	1.0
	Its about a hundred	1.0
	A hundred milliliters	1.0
	These are cubic centimeters	1.0
	They are 100 centimeters that are in a cubeshape in this flat correct	2.0
Yes	So we have 100 cubic centimeters one flat is equal to what	8.0
A hundred	100 whats going to happen when I put in two	8.0
	It should right	2.0
	Three should come up to about 300	1.0
	Jot that down in your journal	1.0
	A different chart	1.0
	Ms Bayer put our key on the board	1.0
	100 centimeters cubed is equivalent to 100 milliliters so if I have two flats in the water two flats push it up or displaces 200 milliliters of water	1.0
	Three flats displaces 300 milliliters of water	1.0
	Another way to find volume is using the displacement method with a scale	1.0
	Our scale is 100 milliliters	1.0
	Are you ready for some fun now	2.0
Yes	Number three is what do we notice	8.0
	Look at the table what do we notice	8.0
	What do you notice about the volume	8.0
	May I borrow yours now Maya	1.0
	No you are just fine	1.0
	I appreciate you helping me with the technology	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	My friend we should have something like this	1.0
	One base 10 flat is equivalent to 100 milliliters its also equivalent to 100 centimeters cubed	1.0
	Partner A and partner B look at your partners journal and make sure your partner is caught up with us at this point	1.0
	What do you notice	8.0
	Do you see a pattern	2.0
	Im seeing some yesses some noes	1.0
	Talk to your A B partner go	2.0
	Three two one and zero	1.0
	What is it that we notice	8.0
	Emma	2.0
That each one gets	Are you noticing that one base 10 block has a volume of 100 milliliters	2.0
	It also has a volume of 100 centimeters cubed	2.0
	Theyre all equivalent yes	2.0
	What could we write here for number three fifth graders	8.0
	What could we write here for what do we notice	8.0
	Nora	2.0
I said I noticed the milliliters and centimeters are equal	They have an equal volume they take up the same amount of space	5.0
	Would you please check your thinking partners journal	1.0
	Do each of you have number three complete	2.0
Yes	Right	1.0
	Get that and you get that	1.0
	I actually have a secondgrade class that needs me at 910 so Im going to tell Ms Bayer about the rest of the lesson	1.0
	Im going to tell you about the rest of the lesson also and then Im going to have you do the brain break and then finish the lesson	1.0
	Heres the rest of the lesson	1.0
	My friends were going to work on math boxes with your thinking partner	1.0
	Hang on	1.0
	Ms Bayer is going to call two table groups at a time to come over here to the back table and you are going to try out some different objects in the water	1.0
	You are going to test out a small can a bigger can a small a medium a larger can	1.0
	Youre going to test out a golf ball	1.0
	I even got a pyramid	1.0
	You have three objects that are you going to test out and you are going to write them down on the middle of page 215	1.0
	Everybody point to the middle of page 215	1.0
	You are going to do the displacement for three or four objects but then write down three of them	1.0
	You are going to do that when you come up with your thinking partner in your groups but its just easier not to have everybody doing it at the same time so youre going to be working on math boxes	1.0
	Ms Bayer is going to call groups back to measure those	1.0
	Does that sound okay	2.0
Yes	Then my friends youre going to do six and seven with your thinking partner	1.0
	Ms Bayer MrTtold me he did number eight back together as a whole class because you will be finding an average	1.0
	What is the average volume of these shapes that weve displaced	1.0
	Okay so he felt like coming back together to talk to through that with their thinking partner then the whole group would help you do that and calculators are okay	1.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
Yes	Ms Bayer will have this up	1.0
	Youre going to do the math boxes 2 to 16	1.0
	If you finish that and youre waiting then you can play expanded ball	1.0
	Ms Bayer will call groups up to the table to do the displacement	1.0
	Its clear youre going to do one through seven with your partner at the back table and were going to do number eight with our full class back together	1.0
	Then my friends at the very end of todays lesson and this Tom this is corrections during the break	1.0
	Okay there it is	1.0
	At the very end of todays lesson were going to discuss how does this displacement pitcher help us determine the volume	1.0
	What is displacement	8.0
	At the very end Ms Bayer after youve talked about it theres an exit clip for them to explain it	1.0
	All right	1.0
	All right so youve been sitting for a while	1.0
	I would like you to go stand up pair up with someone totally different that you have not worked with today	1.0
	Not your current thinking partner	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Then theyre just going to do question three	1.0
	One two three	1.0
	Yes they did that yesterday	1.0
	Okay so if they do that then theyre going to get back in there	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Sorry to run	1.0
	No	1.0
	I think you have the rest of the questions	1.0
	Okay my friends your eyes should be back on Ms Bayer	1.0
	Shes giving you some directions for a brain break	1.0
	You should be standing with a brand new partner	1.0
Then the other one I got  and then the other one I got	All right	1.0
	Fourth graders remember Ms Traverss signal high five	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	Hands down	1.0
	Were there any questions or wonderings about the mental math	2.0
	Elijah	2.0
We got every single one the same	Excellent	1.0
besides the second green one	Okay	1.0
	The second green one Elijah and was your partner Ava	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	Would you ask your classmates if theres someone that could help us with our understanding of this	2.0
If you move it over to the next one that would make it 300s	You guys have a great tool on your name tag	1.0
	You can look at where the decimal is on your name tag and the place just to the right is the 10s	1.0
	The place just to the right of that is the 100s	1.0
	You would have 03	1.0
	Thanks for asking because we know remember what we said the other day	2.0
	What do good math students do	2.0
	Ask questions revise their thinking	1.0
	Awesome job	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Was there another question for mental math William	2.0
Im not very sure  every time you do a hundred point zero	Are you looking at this one right here	2.0
	For 2300s	2.0
	Ask your classmate what should she have for 2300s	2.0
	Have a classmate help you	1.0
	023 or zero and twentythree hundredths	1.0
	So the three would be in the hundredths place	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	My friends so right now you may erase your whiteboard	1.0
	I would like for you to please come to the carpet	1.0
	You are going to face the easel and you dont need to bring anything	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	This is the easel	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	If you have a microphone if I asked you to bring the recorder please bring it	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Thank you for coming so quickly and showing me youre ready	1.0
	So everybodys sitting in place where they can see the easel	2.0
	Can you see it over there Suzanna	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So friends were going to talk about what our goals are today in our lesson	1.0
	Please read this with me	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Solve multistep multiplication number stories	Its almost like a tongue twister isnt it	2.0
	What I want us to talk about is what does this mean Solve multistep multiplication number stories	8.0
	You can put your hands down	1.0
	What I want you to do is high five a partner so I know who youre talking with here at the carpet	1.0
	Show me that you have a partner to talk with at the carpet	1.0
	Abby you might just turn around	1.0
	Henrys right there	1.0
	I love how Ethan came up and he just	1.0
	I know	1.0
	What a great classmate	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	When it says Solve multistep multiplication number stories are we Focus on this word right now multistep	1.0
	What do you think that means	8.0
	Talk with your partner	2.0
	High five	1.0
	High five	1.0
	Jake what did you guys talk about	8.0
We thought it was just like a multiplestep problem	What does that mean multiplestep problem	8.0
Theres many steps in one problem	Thats that word	1.0
	My friends I want you to know that these problems today have two or more steps	5.0
	When youre working on these problems if you just solve one step youre only part of the way there	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So you have two or more steps	1.0
	Multiplication whats another word for multiplication	8.0
	Say it	8.0
	What do you do when you multiply	8.0
Times	Okay	1.0
	We know well be multiplying and number stories	1.0
	How are we feeling about the learning target today	2.0
Good	Cool	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Now heres my next question	1.0
	How are we going to know that we have it today	8.0
	Well there are three things	1.0
	Show me number three	1.0
	There are three things you have to have today to know that youve answered these correctly	1.0
	Keep up number one and read with me	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
Answer in a single number model using parenthesis	Another Whoa	1.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	Talk to that shoulder partner again	2.0
	Go	2.0
Five times seven times five so that you have	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	High five	1.0
	Boy I am telling you there are some kids in here that are on it	1.0
	Show me your high five	1.0
	Bodies turn facing Ms Travers	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Wyatt what do you think this means	8.0
I said to my partner that it means that theres one number model using parenthesis	One number model	4.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	One number	8.0
	sentence	8.0
With parenthesis its like youre using parenthesis to do if it was five times five plus two times five what you would do is	Wyatt Im going to take what you just said and do an example up here	1.0
	Say that again	1.0
	Five	2.0
Times five plus two times five	That is what were working on today	1.0
	Youre going to have a number story and you will represent the number model with two parts	1.0
	Therell be multiple parts	1.0
	There might even be three parts and then therell be parenthesis because you always do the multiplication parts first	1.0
	Then you would have an equal and youre going to have a letter	1.0
	The letter represents the unknown like dollars or money or inches	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	William	2.0
Could we also write down the letter that begins if you know the answer	Yes	1.0
	Well what I usually do it doesnt really matter what letter you use but what I would do is I would say Well I know theyre talking about money	1.0
	So I might use the letter M or D for dollars or C for cost or C for cat	1.0
	Second bullet show me number two on your fingers	1.0
	Second thing we have to have on each of our number stories today	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Estimate	2.0
Estimate each	Tell your same partner what does that mean	8.0
	Telling your partner what estimate	1.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0

	High five	1.0
	You guys are so fast at those high fives	1.0
	Awesome job	1.0
	Elijah tell us about this second bullet	8.0
Estimate is an educated guess	I love that saying educated guess	5.0
	When you say educated what do you use to make that educated guess	8.0
Like you use  to make that guess like you take the stuff from the problem and do maybe use it and round it or something	I love that word	1.0
	You might use rounding or you might take parts of the problem	5.0
Away	away so that you can just look at parts and say Does my answer make sense when I multiply those two numbers	5.0
If we got 3700 for our estimate it has to be somewhere near that number	Lets say you have 3782	5.0
	You might round that up to 4000 because 4000 is an easier number to work with	1.0
	Thanks for that great example	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Number three	8.0
	Show me your number three	8.0
	This is the third thing we have to have	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Read it	2.0
	Go	2.0
Answer with units	Okay	1.0
	You have 10 seconds with your partner	1.0
	What does that mean	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	High five	1.0
	Are we able  Leo	2.0
Answer with units mean its like when you get your answer for your problem you want to	The question really is what is it	8.0
	Right	2.0
	What are we talking about	8.0
	Were talking about money balloons miles inches	1.0
	You will have a word like dollars or whats another one William	8.0
Inches	Inches centimeters	5.0
	You need to have that unit	1.0
Unit  is a keyword	Awesome	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Heres your job	1.0
	You are going to walk back to your desks but on the way back to your desks I want you to think to yourself What are the three parts to all of my answers today	1.0
	Were going to say single number model with	8.0
Parentheses	Parentheses	4.0
	We need an	8.0
Estimate	And we need	8.0
Units	Okay	1.0
	On your way back tell yourself What are the three parts we need in our answer today	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Back to your seats	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Tell yourself What are the three parts for our success criteria today	8.0
	you have  ready for me	1.0
	Boy Im a lucky teacher today	1.0
	I can return mine	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Now that youre back at your seats I would like for you to stand up and face the screen	1.0
	stand up  your chair	1.0
	Face the screen	1.0
	You dont need anything right now	1.0
	Were going to read the math message together	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
How much more would it cost to hire the tap dancers and the jugglers	Okay	1.0
	You can sit back down	1.0
	I want you to picture something in your head	1.0
	Point to your head	1.0
	Close your eyes	1.0
	Picture a carnival	1.0
	Picture the Silver Creek carnival	1.0
	Picture a carnival youve been to somewhere else	1.0
	Picture any carnival	1.0
	Today all of your math problems are about a carnival	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Were going to be figuring out the costs at a carnival	1.0
	Were going to be figuring out things like Whats more expensive the popcorn or the	8.0
	I dont know	1.0
Ice cream	or should we hire tap dancers or jugglers	8.0
	These are real problems that somebody like our PTOs of Silver Creek might have to think of again problems like this when they set up a carnival	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Eyes back open	1.0
	Everybody got a carnival in their head	2.0
	What do you picture Julian	2.0

	Ready	1.0
	Take out your journal Page 188 please	2.0
	You know leave your whiteboards out because if were going to do this we might need a place to write down some thinking from our math	1.0
	One hundred eightyeight	1.0
	Oh my gosh	1.0
	Look at how many kids are showing us their readiness Ms Parker	1.0
	Pencils in their hands Page 188 open	1.0
	All right friends	1.0
	We have two students Ian and  and they are planning their elementary schools carnival	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Or theyre calling it a fair	1.0
	This is the information that theyve researched and they gathered	1.0
	We are going to help these students make the decisions about their carnival	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	What were looking at Our math message was	1.0
	The math message	1.0
	Lets go back to that	1.0
	Thank you Vanna White	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	You might probably dont know what Vanna White	1.0
	Means do you	1.0
No	Mr Powell  do you	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Have you ever seen a game show on TV	1.0
Yes	Where theres one person thats showing the things and doing the things like this	1.0
	Thats Ms Parker for me today	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So were looking at page 188	1.0
	Now which two were looking at what	8.0
Tap dancers	Tap dancers and	8.0
Jugglers	Okay	1.0
	So lets go back to our journal tap dancers and jugglers and were trying to figure out how much more	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Heres jugglers	1.0
	My friends this is	1.0
	Lets talk about this	1.0
	What does all this mean	8.0
	In the juggling group how many people are there juggling	8.0
Three	I want to hear all of your voices	2.0
	How many jugglers are there	8.0
Three	Okay	1.0
	How many hours do the jugglers perform	8.0
Two	How much money does it cost for each performer	8.0
30 an hour	Lets think about that	1.0
	30 an hour for three people	1.0
Wouldnt it be 30 for two hours	Yes but for how many people	8.0
	Three people two hours 30 for each one of those people per hour	1.0
	This is what we have to figure out	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now here we go	1.0
	Tap dancers how many performers for the tap dancing	8.0
Six	I didnt hear you	2.0
Six	How many hours	8.0
Two	How much money do the tap dancers make per hour	8.0
33 per hour	Okay	1.0
	I dont want you to have any pencils or any markers in your hands	1.0
	Put them down	1.0
	All I want you to do right now is talk to your shoulder partner what is this problem asking	1.0
	Thats this question right here	1.0
	What is this problem asking	8.0
	Go	1.0
	Can you put the math message back up	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	High five	1.0
	That was fast	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Just waiting for a couple of kids	1.0
	Great conversations	1.0
	Ms Parker and I we would like to hear from a couple of you and then were going to actually model for you	1.0
	Were going to show you how to talk through each of the steps so that then you can have the rest of the time to talk about steps and you will have a different thinking partner today in a little while	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Right now what are you thinking	8.0
	What is this problem asking	8.0
	Is anyone willing to share	2.0
Its asking how much more money is it for the tap dancer	How much more money	1.0
	If we think back to our success criteria my friends look back up here	1.0
	We need to come up with what is our number model that shows this problem	1.0
	We need to estimate our answer solve our answer and then our answer need to have a unit	1.0
	What units do we think it will be	8.0
Money	Dollars	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Would you please leave everything where you are	1.0
	Were going to have you turn and actually come to the carpet and face the screen	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Look at these friends	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen Ms Parker is my thinking partner today	1.0
	Right away when I get to my new thinking partner remember the very first thing I do	8.0
	Good morning Ms Parker	1.0
	Good morning	1.0
	How are you	1.0
	Im great	1.0
	How are you	1.0

	Yes	1.0
	We should get to work	1.0
	Ms Parker we have four steps in our problemsolving today	1.0
	We have four steps in all of our problems today	1.0
	The first one is were always going to say What is the problem asking	1.0
	Then what are the steps we need to take	8.0
	Does our answer make sense	2.0
	We need to estimate	1.0
	Did we have units	2.0
	Now we have As and Bs and our thinking partners are As and Bs also	1.0
	Today can you please for the first time be Partner A and Ill be Partner B	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	That means if youre Partner A youre asking the questions	1.0
	If Im Partner B that means Im giving you my thinking	1.0
	You can add on if we need to	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to sit here	1.0
	When we do this at our desks we will both have our journals out	1.0
	Perfect	1.0
	Ms Parker were just going to look up here	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	So were looking at tap dancers and jugglers	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Yes and you can use  use this	1.0
	Do you want me to	1.0
	How much more would it cost to hire the tap dancers than the jugglers	8.0
	Ask me my questions	1.0
	Ms Travers step one	1.0
	What is this problem asking you	8.0
	What is this problem asking	8.0
	This problem is asking how much money its going to cost how much more the tap dancers will cost or how much more the jugglers	8.0
	Maybe Im confused	1.0
	Lets look back at our problem Ms Travers	1.0
	How much more the tap dancers	1.0
	Yes how much more it would cost to hire the tap dancers than the jugglers	1.0
	How much more are the tap dancers	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Its always good to clarify	1.0
	Then Ms Travers it wants to know our next step	1.0
	What are the steps to solve the problem	8.0
	Our steps the first thing we need to figure out is Im going to start with tap dancers how much it will cost for the tap dancers	1.0
	Then how much it will cost for the jugglers	1.0
	Then I will make that single number model putting both of those multiplications together but wait a second	1.0
	Am I adding how much more	8.0
	That tells me were not adding	1.0
	Im going to be subtracting	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	That word How much more is always a keyword	1.0
	Remember	2.0
	So we know	1.0
	I really appreciate those of you that are working so hard to be careful listeners right now and youre watching how Ms Parker and I are modeling	1.0
	Remember that would mean your hands are on your lap	1.0
	Youre sitting	1.0
	Your eyes are on us	1.0
	Your eyes are on the screen or on us	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Tap dancers	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Six performers how long friends	8.0
Two hours	How much money	8.0
33 per hour	I know Im going to do multiplication	1.0
	So my friends Im going to start with six performers times two hours times 33	5.0
	Yes because remember Ms Travers it said on here One of our things says Be sure to know that the cost per hour is for each performer in the group	1.0
	Thats kind of the key dont you think	2.0
	Absolutely	1.0
	Each performer because we have six We might even need some labels on this	1.0
	We have six performers	1.0
	Its for two hours and this is how many dollars per performer	8.0
	Ms Travers doesnt this mean right here in the book the slash right here means per hour	1.0
	Per hour 33 for every hour	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	We know from that label too	1.0
	Right	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Thank you so much	1.0
	Now Ms Parker can you please help me	1.0
	We just did	1.0
	Those are the tap dancers	1.0
	Tap dancers	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now I need my money for the jugglers	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Jugglers are	8.0
	Friends I need your help	1.0
	How many performers	8.0
Three	How many hours	8.0
Two	How much money	8.0
Thirty per hour	Thirty per hour	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	That looks like this	1.0
	Three times two times what	8.0
	3000	1.0
	Wow	1.0
	Equals	8.0
	Remember we need that letter	1.0
	The D represents what	8.0
The dollar	Dollars in units	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	So check my success criteria so far fourth graders	1.0
	So far do I have a single that means one number model with parenthesis	2.0
Yes	Have I estimated yet	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Ms Travers step three says does the answer make sense	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to solve first and then estimate	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	If you did 6  2 is 12 and 12  33 Whoops	1.0
	Then Im going to need to do 3  2 is 6 and 6  30	1.0
	Right	1.0
	So far are you agreeing with me	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	What do you guys think	2.0
Yes	So far	2.0
Why does	Oh okay	1.0
	I just heard subtract or add	1.0
	What do you guys Fourth graders what do we think	8.0
Subtract	How do you know	9.0
Because thats how much more	The tap dancers 12  33 Im going to use	1.0
Bow tie	What multiplication strategy do I know	8.0
Bow tie	Okay	1.0
Bow tie	Youd call partial products both sides	1.0
	Im going to start on the left	1.0
	I have 30  10	1.0
	Thirty times 10 is	8.0
Thirty times time	Three hundred	1.0
Wait 33 times	Right	1.0
Yes	That was this	1.0
	Now I need 30  2 which is	8.0
Fiftysix	Sixty and 10  3 which is	8.0
Thirty	Three times two is	8.0
Six	Six	4.0
	So far the tap dancers cost	8.0
Three hundred ninetysix	39600	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Minus Ms Parker what do I need to figure out now	8.0
	We need to figure out the cost of the jugglers	1.0
	The jugglers	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	So 6  30	1.0
	I dont need partial products for that	1.0
	I know 6  3 is what	8.0
Eighteen	Eighteen and I can attach the zero and get	8.0
One hundred eighty	One hundred eighty equals D for dollars	5.0
	Now 396  180 is	8.0
Two hundred sixteen	You didnt think	2.0
	You dont think	2.0
Hold on because	What do you think	8.0
	You know what were showing you right now	2.0
	Were showing you our thinking so that then you can go do your own thinking	1.0
	Ms Parker if I think about this Im just going to use my estimate with this problem down here	1.0
	I know 396 is close to 400 and I know 180 is close to 200	1.0
	So  since youre over there what two words when were estimating we use what	8.0
Round to each numbers	Round to get easy numbers so 400  200 is	8.0
Two hundred	Two hundred	4.0
	So my estimate is	8.0
	So is 216 a reasonable answer	2.0
Yes	Her last question says What units does it use	8.0
Dollars	Dollars	4.0
	Right	1.0
	Dollars	1.0
	I would make sure that in my journal I have my number model I have my estimate and then my answer with my unit	1.0
	My friends guess what your job is now	2.0
To go do the problem	Youre going to do number one with your new thinking partner and after you stand up youre going to take a walk back over and check out your new thinking partner	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Freeze	1.0
	Youre going to go find your new thinking partner	1.0
	Do you remember when Ms Parker and I greeted each other this morning	1.0
	All I want you to do right now Freeze	1.0
	Freeze is get your math journal get your pencil and go greet your new thinking partner	1.0
	Go	1.0
Its technically not	Go find your thinking partner	1.0
Hello	Go find your thinking partner	1.0
	Grab your journal	1.0
	Grab your pencil	1.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0

	Ready	2.0
	Hands down	1.0
	Three	1.0
	Two	1.0
	One	1.0
	High five	1.0
	When you high five that voice should be off	1.0
	Now follow with your eyes	1.0
	Follow up here	1.0
	For this round these are our As and these are our Bs	1.0
	These are our As these are our Bs	1.0
	If you are an A you are asking the questions like Ms Parker did	1.0
	If you are a B you are answering like I did but both partners are writing	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Just for number one then were going to come back to the carpet and check	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Here are your steps	1.0
	Whats the problem asking	8.0
	What are our steps	8.0
	Does our answer make sense	2.0
	What unit do we use	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	five minutes	1.0
	Well see	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Ill check in with you in five minutes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Would you wave at me right now if youre Partner A	2.0
	Youre asking the questions	1.0
	Wave at me right now if youre Partner B	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Youre thinking out loud and Partner A is responding	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Wave at me right now if youre writing today	1.0
	That should be both of you	1.0
	Youre both doing the writing	1.0
	Come in	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
No	Lets start  and look at Ms Travers	1.0
	Im going to put Ms Travers	1.0
	Friends commercial break	1.0
	Theres no commercial now	1.0
	We dont even have any commercials anymore	1.0
	How much more I just want you to take a minute and look at the screen because we have our example problem and that might help you with your steps	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	We have our parentheses two times for two parts of the problem and then the labels and then showing what you solved	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Continue	1.0
	Well meet back at the carpet in two minutes	1.0
	I really love how you  that youre working on	1.0
	What do you need	2.0
	Are you A	2.0
	No its fine	1.0
	My friends	1.0
	Regular multiple	1.0
	Tell me where you are now	1.0
	Single number model	1.0
	Ryan have you finished	2.0
	What number model	1.0
	Fourth graders please freeze	1.0
	Would you all please show me on your fingers how many minutes just for this problem number one would be helpful for you and your partner to have a success number model estimate answer with units	2.0
	Im thinking three two or one minute	1.0
	Show me now	2.0
Two minutes	Okay we will meet in the carpet in two minutes with what you have okay	1.0
	Just what you its okay with what you have	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Pampara pam pam	2.0
Pam pam	I am seeing the most amazing math thinking	1.0
	Id like you to bring your journal and your pencil to the carpet and face the screen	1.0
	Go	1.0
	All right nice children Im going to have some students be the showers right now and Im going to just do some talking and showing upfront	1.0
	Ms Travers I saw so many people just persevering and talking through problems because these were hard right	2.0
	You know what I want to tell you guys theres something called a math practice standard	1.0
	That means what we want all fourth graders to be able to do and one of those is called persevere through the problem and I know a lot of you did that today	1.0
	Ive asked a couple of students to show their number models	1.0
	Im going to wait until its quiet	1.0
	While youre at the carpet you are welcomed to add on to what you have but I want you to still be focused on this problem	1.0
	Do not move onto the next problem because you might hear some really great thinking from your classmates	1.0
	Remember we talked about how good math students revise their thinking	2.0
	Get your pencil ready to revise your math thinking if you need to or to add to it okay	2.0
	All right would you two start for us please	8.0
First we did 40 x 16  8 x 3 x 22   because its a unit	I like how you used that word unit	5.0
	Me too	1.0
Then after I did that I did 528  192 because those are my two answers and that equals 336	Because we were finding the difference and so you know you needed to subtract the two amounts	1.0
	The difference in the amount is 336 what	8.0
Dollars	Dollars thank you	5.0
	They did a really good job too because when I went over there at one of the steps they both had a different answer and so going back through and figuring out Skylar was working at his to see where they had a different answer and it just had to do with multiplying and then they got	1.0
	Thats the accuracy	1.0
	When we have a problem like this we have to think what is it asking	1.0
	We have to know how to solve and we have to be accurate	1.0
	Theres a lot to these problems	1.0
	Skylar can we take a quick glance at yours	2.0
	Audience would you please put your eyes back to the screen	2.0
Then for the tumblers there was eight performers it was three hours and it was 22 per hour so then we took 8 x 3 to get 24 and 4 x 3 to get 12 and then 12 x 16 to get 192 and 24 x 22 to get 528 and then 528  192 equals	336	1.0
Then we estimated and we rounded 528 to 500	Because 500 is an easier number to work with	5.0
	Thank you for sharing	1.0
	Would you please give three claps to those two thinking partners	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	My friends on the carpet Im going to tell you something I noticed	1.0
	Every fourthgrader in here right now should have the number model the estimate and should show their thinking on the problem because were showing you four ways to do it right now	1.0
	Say that again	1.0
	We didnt get done so what should you do at the carpet right now if you didnt get done	8.0
Trying to finish off	Trying to finish	4.0
	Were listening to how our friends solved so that we can go back to our own work and solve our own work	1.0
	Were not just sitting here	1.0
	We love listening to our classmates but the reason were listening to our classmates is	8.0
	Why	8.0
I dont know	See each others thinking to help us at the carpet too so please keep adding on and revising your thinking at the carpet right now	1.0
	Ms Parker and I are going to go round and check all your journals	2.0
	If you noticed Skylar did it multiple times didnt she	2.0
	She did it multiple times to make sure that she didnt make a tiny little mistake you know what I mean	1.0
	To doublecheck yourself always especially with multiplestep problems	1.0
	Hunter and Jake worked together	1.0
	Were just going to show one journal right now because of time but Hunter and Jake their thinking was similar and together so Hunter share with us how you solved	8.0
Because we did the estimate before we did our answer	My friends listen to this this is different than how I showed you	1.0
	This is different and this is another successful strategy	1.0
	Say that again Hunter	2.0
We did our estimate before our answer so that we could figure out our answer before we did it	You could say then Our answer is close to our estimate so we must be right	5.0
	Okay	1.0
We took out 200 from 530 too and got 330 and then with our number model we did 528  192 and got 336 and since 336 is our answer we only need six off of our estimate	Can I have some questions comments or feedback for Hunter and Jake	2.0
I like how you guys showed it like how Skylar showed it and Maddison and	Axel that took a lot of courage to say I really watched how you guys solved and I noticed a mistake or a step I left out	1.0
	Are you going back and changing it right now in your journal	2.0
Yes	Fabulous	1.0
	Thats what I want to see fourthgraders doing	1.0
	Nice job my friend	1.0
	All right so my friends I want to look up here at the success criteria	1.0
	Look at your journal right now and you can look at Hunters thats on the screen too but look at yours	1.0
	Do you have a single number model using parenthesis	2.0
	That means right here this is Hunters number model	1.0
		1.0
	Look at yours	1.0
	Do you have a single number model	2.0
	If you dont fix it now and then we want to check our next part of success	1.0
	Do you have an estimate to check yourself	2.0
	See if youre answer is reasonable	1.0
	Then do you have your answer with units	2.0
	Hunter what is the answer and what is the units	8.0
33600	Thank you for sharing	1.0
	Please give those two gentlemen three claps	1.0
	Heres your job friends	1.0
	What	2.0
I just realized that	My friends Ms Parker is it snack	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Heres your job	1.0
Excuse me	Just a minute please Ill talk to you in just a second honey	1.0
	You are going to do number two	1.0
	The same thinking partner	1.0
	Reverse whos the asking whos the answering but remember both of you were writing in your journals	1.0
	You may do number two while youre eating snacks	1.0
	You may sit around the room but Ms Parker when is recess	1.0
	10 minutes	1.0
	That is your time right now	1.0
	10 minutes	1.0
	You dont have any time to waste	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	Snack problem number two go	1.0
Excuse me	Yes	1.0
Do we estimate number two	You estimate number two question number two	5.0
	All right so for heres the scoop for today so for the first half of class were going to be working on finishing 38 this is where we left off on Friday and got just a few things to show you in that and then also show you one particular skill out of 39 that we need and then well take a short break during the passing period and start the quiz afterward and it is an individual quiz	1.0
	There will be no calculator but you can use your toolkit	1.0
	Thats the scoop for today any questions on that	2.0
Yes its quite a scoop	Its a good scoop	1.0
	Okay so this is yes	1.0
	On your switch	1.0
Yes	Whats your switch	1.0
	If you can show me if we could stamp off all of your toolkits then Ill be happy	1.0
Theres still one loophole she uses so	Alright guys Im going to send you a video youre going to like	1.0
Yes	Yes all right yes	1.0
Thats the	Yes were like this	1.0
I dont	Hey would we have the reminder weekly test	1.0
Yes I dont know if its	The question was about the review so the review is out of the textbook and you should have access to it today online but you always have it in the book to be looking at	1.0
	If you look at the book it has examples and then the problems	1.0
	It refreshes your memory on how to do those problems	1.0
	I did eliminate several of the problems from the review because youre not responsible for those so not every problem from the review is there but most of the problem I think its might be 32 of them or something like that	1.0
For the quiz is it just like 38 or is it like the cumulative like that	Its a wee bit cumulative so the primary emphasis is why Im factoring and solving but theres a little vocabulary stuff in there	1.0
	I think its 12	1.0
Squeaky key	All right so lets refresh our memory on the sentence stems that we used last Friday and I am going to have you work in your teams with this but were not going to change our desks were going to keep the desks like this or just have you turn around in your chairs and so person number one this is your formula and so thats like Brad then Tobias you have two and then three and four	1.0
	You dont have to answer them in that order so for example if person four says Im ready to go	1.0
	That person can start and what you need to do as youre listening to your teammates is making sure that theyre understanding correctly all of this stuff	1.0
	Now why does this become important	9.0
	Its if you were asked to graph this this is part of not only your thought process but what you have to do at the end when youre looking at your graph and youre looking at the equation and going Do they match	1.0
	These are some of the ideas you need to put together for graphing as well	1.0
	When youre done Im going to have your team stand up that way Ill know that your team is done	1.0
	Like I said it doesnt matter who starts but go through all of these recognize that like for this bullet therere two choices	1.0
	Then notice that I want you to be able to explain why you came up with that answer or how you came up with it whats your strategy	8.0
	Right so go ahead and turn in your groups and whoever wants to start can go ahead and get going	2.0
Were done	Oh are you guys done	2.0
	stand up if youre done stand up	2.0
	Ill give you guys one more minute	1.0
	All right guys open your journals to page 98	1.0
	All right guys page 98	1.0
Location principle	The location principle go ahead Colin tell us what it is	2.0
It acts as a polynomial function and A and B are two real numbers such that FMA is less than zero and that would be as greater than zero that F has at least one real zero between A and B	Thats a lot of math talk for something thats pretty simple were saying that in this particular case our Yvalue is greater than zero so Y is	8.0
Positive	If Y is positive that would be up here anything near this pink range is a positive Yvalue	5.0
	Ive got some Bvalue and a Y this point could be anywhere in this pink area then the same thing is true over here Y is less than zero so Y is	8.0
A negative	And its anywhere in here if I have those two and its a connected polynomial I know that there is an Xintercept in between those two numbers thats as sophisticated as that gets	1.0
	The wording is tough to work through but the picture makes sense hopefully	1.0
	Anybody have a question on that or need to hear somebody else explain it	2.0
To summarize this segment theres one point between A and B thats where Y is zero	Yes makes  sense	1.0
Oh thats hard to see that theres a zero	All right moving a long if we were using a graphing calculator and we have a Y and a Y what would have to be true in between	8.0
	Thered have to be a zero somewhere in there so that means theres an Xintercept at onepointsomething in this particular case	1.0
	Again this is just more about being able to analyze graphs	1.0
	Since were not using calculators on the test Im not going to spend much more time on this but you get the concept and thats all I really want to expose you to is that concept	1.0
	Then the next concept is turning points all right if you look at just the brown the first statement thats there Christian oh you just took a bite	1.0
	Cooper could you read number one for me please	2.0
The graph of every polynomial function of degree N has at most N1 turning points	The graph of every polynomial function of degree N if I look here whats the degree of this one	8.0
Three	What would 31 be	8.0
Two	It has two	8.0
Turning points	Thats all this is saying what could the degree of this one be	8.0
Four	Four could be more than that but basically four so 41 is	8.0
Three	One two three turning points	5.0
I like this	Or local min and max this would be a local minimum and I have another local minimum	1.0
	In this location I have a minimum and in this location Ive got a minimum as well so we use that term local minimum then over here we have one two three four five	1.0
Quintic	Quintic 51 one two three four turning points and the reason it says at most was because remember something like this could actually look like that	5.0
It could still be Quintic	And still be Quintic	5.0
I was going to say couldnt it actually be more than Quantic though couldnt be sextic	It could	1.0
	Yes and you have the right idea that its got to be an odd number because its going in different directions	1.0
Because your sign is there based on what you have	Thats why you could have any degree	1.0
	Thats the first part of these turning points of polynomial equations	1.0
	Brad could you read number two for us	2.0
If a polynomial equation has N	Okay so were talking about zeros	1.0
	Zeros means	8.0
Xintercept	X intercepts	4.0
	I have one two three Xintercepts	1.0
	I have three minus one or two turning points	1.0
	So up here we were looking at the degree of the polynomial	1.0
	Here Im looking at the Xintercepts the zeros the roots the solution kind of thing and so I see one two three four Xintercepts and I have one two three one less	1.0
	One two three four five Xintercepts	1.0
	How many turning points we have for	8.0
Those two go hand in hand because the degree determines	It also depends though where this polynomial function is	1.0
	It could be that actually all my turns are up here and I only have one and thats why you see the word exactly for this particular one cause weve counted the number of Xintercept versus at most that particular number of turning points	1.0
	Whats in Italics right there also becomes important	1.0
	Any questions on this	2.0
	Again more conceptual understanding seeing relationships of polynomial equations and graphs and well skip over these	1.0
	This is one that were going to do a little bit of work on and thats something called even and odd function	1.0
	Now dont confuse that with even and on degree	1.0
	Were still saying even and odd but its about either the degree that weve talked a lot about or in this case even or odd functions	1.0
	You got to key in on that particular word and the even or odd degree	1.0
	No thats not what were talking about here	1.0
	What were talking about is an even function is symmetrical about the Yaxis	1.0
	In other words if I took my graph and folded it right here on the Yaxis it would lay on top of each other	1.0
	Then an odd function is symmetrical about the origin	1.0
	In other words if I took my curve and pinned it down right there and spun it 180 degrees it ended up laying on top of itself again	1.0
	All right so two types of cemetery about the Yaxis if this is true well explain that in just a minute or about the origin if this is true	1.0
	What we do mathematically notice that they both start with exactly the same thing	1.0
	Were going to plug in a negative X and then were going to manipulate it and see if I end up with my original function or I end up with the opposite of the original function	1.0
	If I end up with something else then its neither an odd function or an even function	1.0
	So what does that look like	8.0
	If you want to turn in your text or just follow along on the screen here either will find youd be in the texts at page 171	1.0
	This is our first one	1.0
	I remember no matter what were testing we just plug in a negative X so every place that I see an X I put a parentheses	1.0
	Theres an X with the cube outside of it so thats what I do just the X but parentheses with the negative X in it	1.0
	Then the parentheses with the negative X here	1.0
	Then I got to do a little math	1.0
	Whats negative X times negative X times negative X going to be	8.0
	Its going to be negative	1.0
	Cause right	2.0
	Im multiplying by three times itll still be a XQ	1.0
	The negative times the negative here gives me a positive 7X and then I have to rewrite this to look like that	1.0
	In other words to get this to look like that Ive got to factor out the negative sign	1.0
	That becomes positive inside that becomes negative so theres my F of X I actually do have when I plug in a negative X I have the negative F of X	1.0
	We determined them that its an odd function and going back to this an odd function we could say is symmetrical about the origin	1.0
	Again this is something that can help us in understanding what the graph should look like	1.0
	If I do this type of test I know it should be symmetrical about the origin	1.0
	Thats the value of this	1.0
	Then we look at the next one	1.0
	Again Im just going to take this	1.0
	My first step is rewriting this with parentheses every time I see an X and I plug in the negative X	1.0
	Now if I multiply negative X four times it ends up being positive and the negative X twice thats going to be positive	1.0
	Then I have the 1	1.0
	Well look at what I already have	1.0
	I just ended up right back to my original function	1.0
	Thats the definition of how to test for an even one and that ones going to be symmetrical about the Yaxis	1.0
	Only two types of symmetry that were testing Yaxis and about the origin	1.0
Thats really weird	I know and but in a certain sense thats also what we thought of with odd and even degrees too though is positive and negative	5.0
Yes	This is one where it doesnt work out in either case	1.0
	I take this I plug in the negative X raise that to the third power	1.0
	That will be a negative X 32	1.0
	Theres no way I can factor anything out of this guy for it to look like that and so that ones not going to be symmetrical about the Yaxis or about the origin	1.0
	This idea of odd and even functions there are a couple of problems in the homework of doing this process	1.0
	Just make a mental note example four can walk you through that out of the textbook you need	1.0
	Yes	1.0
They seem to have that more capability being	Yes because we know that if I plug a negative and its all positive theyre going to be positive	1.0
	Yes youre recognizing some of the patterns that go along with that	1.0
	I dont really want to take time in class to practice this	1.0
	Im sorry	1.0
	Just the time constraints for today	1.0
	This is less important than what Im about to tell you	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Any questions before we leave that	2.0
	Again the homework does have some of that	1.0
	Refer back to that example to walk through that	1.0
	Were actually going to flip over then to 39	1.0
	Page 101 has our essential question and Dante could you read that for me please	2.0
How can you find a time on the old model for reallife data	Hallway partner whats a polynomial model	8.0
	Tell your window partner	2.0
	All right so Andy what is it	8.0
Something gets modeled with a polynomial	What does it look like when I say well heres my model	8.0
	What am I handing you	8.0
A graph	I could be a graph or	8.0
A table	A table or	8.0
A chart	An equation	1.0
	Yes for the most part what were talking about here is actually having an equation	1.0
	How can we take reallife data and create equations out of it and what were going to focus on Oh this is kind of cool so just real briefly do you remember when we found the differences in math too	2.0
	We were like as X goes up by a specific amount every time and then we start to subtract make the differences between each of the Yvalues and it told us various things about the model that we were working with	1.0
	It turns out that if the differences I think if you do it twice its a quadratic if it works out with the third differences are the same I forget exactly but you can go back in and lookup	1.0
	Its interesting	1.0
	Were not going to go there	1.0
	Youre not responsible for doing this but it is an interesting pattern to see	1.0
	I know Christian you like to look at patterns	1.0
I do indeed	This is the only place were going to camp and 39 is on this first example	1.0
	Weve done this type of thing with quadratics before	1.0
	This is a familiar skill	1.0
	We just need to apply it for cubing	1.0
	What happens here is youre going to be given a graph or maybe a list of points	1.0
	It could be either graph or list of points and asked to come up with the equation for that	1.0
	Now be careful on the test if youre asked to do that	1.0
	Pay attention to your prompt as to whether or not you have to leave your final answer in a certain form	1.0
	If it doesnt say this would be fine	1.0
	It might say standard form in which case then you actually have to multiply all that out	1.0
	Refresh your memory on how to multiply that out	1.0
	Step one were going to use our Xintercepts of 4 to create the factor X4	1.0
How	Xintercept of 1 X1 intercept of 3 X3	1.0
	What is this for this A value	8.0
	Window partner	2.0
	Explain what that A is all about	8.0
	Window partner go	2.0
	Slow	1.0
	Does my red polynomial have the same Xintercept	2.0
Would that be imaginary	Or what if it looked like that	8.0
	Would that have the same Xintercepts	2.0
Yes but its a much  function	What makes the difference	8.0
The A	The A right	2.0
	Thats why we have to know how are these Xintercepts in a sense being modified to come up with that specific graph	1.0
	Yes	2.0
When you multiply into standard form do you multiply the set of intercepts by themselves in that A value or do you distribute it or	If I asked you to do that tell me how to do it	8.0
Just go across then okay	You pick two and multiply them	1.0
	Ill just pick those two and multiply and I get an answer	1.0
	Then I multiply by the next guy	1.0
	Whats the answer to this going to be or do I do 2x3 and get six and 2x4 and get eight and multiply that together to get 48	2.0
Multiply with the 1 2 by the X4 and move that to X times the X1	Right	1.0
	It doesnt matter right because 2x3x4 is the same thing as 3x2x4 so it doesnt matter what order you go in	1.0
	You might look at a couple of these and what if this was X4 and X4	8.0
	Well thats the difference of two squares	1.0
	I can easily combine that	1.0
	You might look to see which ones make more sense	1.0
	I wouldnt want to multiply the 1 2 times an odd number probably	1.0
Okay so just multiply them all basically	Yes multiply them all	5.0
	We have the setup with this and then we have to find another X Y point to plug in there	1.0
	Well either be given one or I can look on the graph and go you know what that is crossing right there and I can put that point in or Im told the point as an extra point	1.0
	I cant put in one of the Xintercepts because Ive already accounted for those here	1.0
	It has to be a different point other than the Xintercepts	1.0
	We can plug in the X and the Y	1.0
	Of course if we have the Yintercept really nice we can plug in zero for X makes that calculation a whole lot easier	1.0
	We go down and we end up finding A and then dont forget before youre done that you actually plug that A value in and specify that as your last step	1.0
	How do you check	8.0
	You use all of that stuff we just talked about	1.0
	Youll look at this youll look at that	1.0
	Does it all make sense	2.0
	Thats your sanity check on it	1.0
	For the rest of this period Im going to have you work on these first four problems to practice coming up with the cubic equations finding the A value all that sort of stuff	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	The bell for this is at 1007	1.0
	Youve got 12 minutes to work on that four problems	1.0
	Can you do it in three minutes each	2.0
	Give it a shot	1.0
	See if you can do it in three minutes	1.0
	Im going to have you stop working on that one	1.0
	Now go back to this one and see if you can figure out how to start	1.0
If it is in parentheses I get three and then do I subtract it over or do I divide it over	Well what are we doing with all of those	8.0
We said its equal to zero	Well actually you said its equal to three	5.0
so then do I subtract this over here	Well what are we doing with all of these things here	8.0
	We adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	8.0
Multiplying	Multiplying so multiply them all together and what do you get	8.0
3 times A is 3	So then write equals 3A	5.0
	Then 3 on the left side just to	1.0
	So now what are the 3 and the A doing	8.0
	Are adding subtracting multiplying or dividing	8.0
So  equals X	Exactly	1.0
	So you divide both sides by 3	1.0
Then Ill have to write out the whole thing	Yes	1.0
Do we have to do exercises 5 through 8	No	1.0
	What on the graph tells me something is squared	8.0
	Its when it does what	8.0
	so which one of those factors gets squared	8.0
Thats where it bounces	See it bounces there	2.0
	That factor is X1	1.0
	Andy a little selfdiscipline never hurts anybody	1.0
	Andy I think you have some work	1.0
	You are not staying on the right page over here	1.0
	So heres a template	1.0
	The reason I wrote this twice  I can go ahead and just plug in the Xintercepts	1.0
	If its supposed to be a cubic one of those two has to be a repeated one	1.0
	I got to put a square on one of those	1.0
	Because my template was X1	1.0
	This is where its bouncing so my X1 is the one thats going to be squared	1.0
	Look at what I have	1.0
	Now the extra point is already here	1.0
	Thats the X so I am going to put a 2 in there	1.0
	Heres my steps	1.0
	My first step was just to plug in the Xintercept my second step plugging in the point there	1.0
	Hopefuly that help give a template that you can always use to start the process	1.0
	So theres my template I have two Xintercepts	1.0
	Now what are my two Xintercepts	8.0
	1 and 1	1.0
	One of these is going to have to be squred because theres a cubic  Which of those Xintercepts	8.0
	What happens at 1 thats different than 1	8.0
	All right guys this is the time to take a little bit of a break to get up walk around if you need to throw up awater bottle	1.0
	When the bell rings were going to start the quiz	1.0
	All right guys were going to split up the desks into rows	1.0
	Lets just make it easy for your teams and have you just go to those desks	1.0
	Neil just go the behind Cody then you can go to the last desk up there	1.0
Are we allowed to use the books too	Lets say that you can do that	1.0
	Brad just asked about being able to use the old quiz in addition to your toolkit lets say you can do that	1.0
	You can use this and just the toolkit but no calculators and yes no textbooks	1.0
	You can put your textbook and journal away	1.0
	Toolkits the practice quiz as it turned out to be no calculators phones need to be off and off of you	1.0
	Theyre not in your pocket	1.0
	Theyre in your backpack	1.0
	You guys need to split	1.0
	You guys should be	1.0
	Toolkits and the quiz you could use those	1.0
	Actually you can turn off the microphones and bring them back up to my desk	1.0
	Hold down the little power button	1.0
	I am going to have you sit in this desk	1.0
	You put that away	1.0
	Take all the other stuff out it then	1.0
Thank you	Youre welcome	1.0
	You want to take it	1.0
Yes sure	There you go	1.0
	Everybody has got a test	1.0
	A quiz rather	1.0
	Lets go ahead and write the time at the top of your paper	1.0
	Right now its 1016	1.0
	You got 12 problems here	1.0
	What youre going to do is figure out okay how long does it take me to do 12 problems knowing that on Wednesday theres 20 multiple choice	1.0
	You get an idea are you ready Are you pretty good today for the multiplechoice on Wednesday or youre going to have to get a little sharper so you can go a little faster	1.0
	A chance to check out how quickly can you get stuff done	1.0
	The main thing that needs to come SS through from your homework last night	1.0
	Think about this question they came with	1.0
	They said Theres someone at my table who has their quadrilateral in a different place than mine is their answer still correct	2.0
Yes	Fine	1.0
	Talk about that at your teams why could that still be correct	9.0
	Okay back to me please	1.0
	So please could someone have the correct answer why or why not	9.0
	Even if its not the same as yours	1.0
If mine was reSSy big and Sammys was reSSy smSS itll still be the same thing	How is it the same thing	8.0
Theyre still the same shapes	Yes you had to draw a quadrilateral it didnt say what size it said just make a quadrilateral right	2.0
	Elex	2.0
It also says plot any three points	There you go	1.0
	Plot any	5.0
	Thats keywords there	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	I like where I see some people giving feedback	1.0
	Lets go on to slate please	1.0
	Its fine dont worry about it just do it	1.0
	SS right I am going to be displaying a mixed number or a fraction and you record an equivalent mixed number or fraction with the same denominator on your slate so it has to have to same denominator	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Looks like a lot of people are SS saying 1 12	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Heres your next attempt	1.0
	Try 54	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	A lot of people saying 1 14	1.0
	I see a couple of people that dont seem to have the strategy so Im going to have you talk with your shoulder partner about how to do this	8.0
	Partner A explains her thinking first	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Do we need to talk about this or do we have it now	2.0
	Okay here we go then	1.0
	Lets try another one	1.0
	Sorry I dont know if these two things are clacking together clacking on the buttons or what	1.0
	Try this one	1.0
	Lets make it bigger so you can actuSSy see it	1.0
	113 and flash	1.0
	Excellent	1.0
	I see most people getting 3 23	1.0
	This time with your face partner partner B talks first this time	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Lets see if people can implement that	1.0
	Try another one	1.0
	1 75	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Were going to talk about your answers at the team level	1.0
	Start with person number four sharing their thinking first	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Could people have a different answer but still be correct	2.0
	What do you think	2.0
	I see a lot of people agreeing	1.0
	Why do you say that Brendan	9.0
It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1	Okay I like your thinking but I think I asked a different question	1.0
	Could somebody have a different answer that would still be correct	2.0
	Thats what Im asking because I saw some people say something like 2 25 are 125 so why could those still be the same thing	9.0
	Thats what youre supposed to talk about with your partner	2.0
	Thats what I talk about any time we agree to talk	1.0
	Okay looks like people did talk about that	1.0
	Why do people have different answers but they still be correct	9.0
	Ravier	2.0
Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25	Okay people are agreeing that	1.0
	What would you like to add to that Kyle	3.0
I agree with everybody but I also want to add that you could actuSSy answer that the same because you could make it a mixed number or an improper fraction	I agree with that	1.0
	Thank you Matteo	1.0
	They SS have to be what	8.0
	Say the word in your hands	1.0
	Shout it out	2.0
Equal fractions	SS right lets try one more	1.0
	5 72	1.0
	Now flash	1.0
	Im seeing some interesting answers	1.0
	Youre going to talk about these with your face partner please	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	How well could you rearrange these using the same denominator	8.0
	Chris thank you	1.0
	Think for a minute why is this an important skill	9.0
	How do we use this potentiSSy	8.0
	How could this help us	8.0
	If you have an idea stand up please	1.0
	Why bother renaming improper fractions mixed numbers fractions themselves why do we rename them	9.0
	Stand up turn around and talk about that with your partner teams	2.0
	Great thank you	1.0
	Lets hear what is the relevance of renaming these	8.0
	Hannah	2.0
First I said maybe when youre baking something you could have for example cookies you could have a certain amount of flour maybe a more exact amount maybe you could I dont know convert it to a more precise expression	Pick somebody thats trying or what to communicate with you	3.0
Like this improper fraction could be in cups or ounces like the fractions and can convert it because it would be equivalent	I couldnt disagree with what youre saying	1.0
	I think somebody else does too Barun	2.0
I want to disagree because	The denominator still had to be two so youre still talking about something that had a two in the denominator so I dont see why changing that is going to change what youre measuring devices will be because youre still going to be using the half cup measuring cup in that instance	1.0
	Why would you want to be able to be flexible with changing these numbers	9.0
	Kaya	2.0
You have to be able to know how to convert them so you can make it easier for yourself	I know for regrouping for subtraction sometimes you have to regroup so that you can subtract even though the number doesnt appear like it wanted to it reSSy is then you can regroup it	1.0
	Okay thank you	1.0
	Lets please look at todays learning intention	1.0
	Is it right here	1.0
	Read this with me please	2.0
On the 10th form ordered pairs graph them enter the coordinate values in context	Thats reSSy wordy so lets think about that and form ordered pairs	1.0
	Give me a gesture that helps me know that you know what order the pairs will be	1.0
	Yes good	1.0
	Theres numbers in between parentheses	1.0
	Graph them for me a gesture for that	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Good plotting points and graphing them and interpret	1.0
	Look down below on the left you see where it says interpret	2.0
	Interpret means to make sense of something	1.0
	Like sometimes people speak a different language and you get an interpreter that can help you understand their language	1.0
	They can restate things in that native language to them so interpret	1.0
	Coordinate values needs to make sense of something to interpret what your values are your plotted points in context	1.0
	Look at with the righthand side underneath	1.0
	In context means the situation in which something happens	1.0
	The situation itself within that example of that situation	1.0
	What do you know about context already	8.0
	Think for a minute	1.0
	What do you know about context	8.0
	You might think context clue like that	1.0
	What does that mean when you say context clues	8.0
	Make sure youre thinking with your face partner	1.0
	Partner with any of those friends if youre ready to go	1.0
	Turn back to me	1.0
	Blake what would context clue be	8.0
Say for citric acid what can you read about it and you dont know and you have to look in that sentence like around it to see what that means	A lot of people agree with his thinking	1.0
	In context just means looking around what the situation means	1.0
	I could form ordered pairs graph them and figure out what they mean in that situation	1.0
	I dont know why we didnt just order it that way but we did it	1.0
	Lets look at the success criteria	1.0
	Look at the first one	1.0
	Read it with me	2.0
Write ordered pairs correctly	We shouldnt say pairs	1.0
	Sorry shouldnt do this at ten oclock at night	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Ordered pairs correctly	1.0
	How many of you already know how you can do that	2.0
	Yes weve been practicing that SS week nice job	1.0
	Graph them accurately	1.0
	How many of you can already do that	2.0
	Excellent	1.0
	Some of us are still practicing thats good to know too	1.0
	Then the third bullet read that	2.0
Answer questions related to the data correctly	Youre going to be looking at your graphs that you created today and answering some questions SS right	2.0
	How are these skills relevant	8.0
	Why should we be able to do this	9.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	Partner B goes first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Back to me	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Evy whats the relevance of this	8.0
When we are older and using graphs to structures we can make sure its precise	Some people agree but I see some people want to add to that	1.0
	Pick somebody	3.0
Like youre here and then youre trying to get here and you can find out how many miles or steps I think is what they cSSed it in the graphs	Great	1.0
	I like your realworld connection thank you	1.0
	Lets go ahead and go to the map message	1.0
	Look at this	1.0
	Lets see	1.0
	Look at the data in the table in journal page 138	1.0
	Lets turn there to see what theyre talking about please	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
		1.0
	Look at the data table	1.0
	Touch where the data table is on page 138	1.0
	Show your partner	1.0
	If youre showing the graph thats not a data table	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Turn to the partners across from you to see if you agree with them	3.0
	Thank you	1.0
	So thats the data table	1.0
	Lets keep looking now back at the board	1.0
	Ms Arvit told her class to use the data to write ordered pairs	1.0
	Sarah wrote the following ordered pairs	1.0
	Thats a nine that one right there in the following line	1.0
	Thats a nine yes	1.0
	Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Give me a thumbs up if youre ready to share	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	Partner A goes first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	What have you discussed about that	8.0
	Barun	2.0
We discussed that this is not SS of the data because she didnt get it SS because it was supposed to be 17 because the coordinates on the Xaxis and then those would be on the Yaxis	A couple of pieces of their data they reversed didnt they	2.0
	You always have to keep that first number for the X and the second number for the Yaxis	1.0
	Nice job catching that problem that we had	1.0
	I feel like this is accessible to you this first part	1.0
	Writing the ordered pairs making the grid or graphing applying the points	1.0
	Thats something that weve been doing already	1.0
	Everybody have your work in check with your partner and then Ill come back to you to do a little work with the questions SS right	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	I dont know what do you think	8.0
	What do you think Thomas	8.0
	Why	9.0
Because you can see in the track what it is	That makes sense	1.0
	SS right look like as I walk around the room that most people have not finished	1.0
	Im going to have somebody take their math journal under the document camera so we can doublecheck ours and give feedback back to them	1.0
	Lets see who our lucky person is	1.0
	Kaya	2.0
	Were not working on ours were looking at what Kayas done	1.0
I did 5 1 7 3 9 5 11 7 21 8 and I had them right here do I show how I found where they are	I dont know do you guys feel like you need to see that or are youre good and you dont need to see it	2.0
	Okay I noticed that you dont have a line to connect your plotted points	1.0
	What do you think would that be helpful why or why not	9.0
I think that would be helpful because it might show you a pattern in between for how far apart they are	Okay so is there a straight edge at your desk there that you could use	2.0
	You see how shes laying that along the edge of SS of the plotted points David	1.0
	Heres another question does it make sense to extend the line past these points	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Think time	1.0
	Would it make sense to extend that line past these points	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	You can just talk with your shoulder partner about this partner A goes first	2.0
	Back to me for one minute	1.0
	Are we going to talk about structures right now	2.0
No	No were talking about Lilith and Noahs age at five different time in their lives so youre trying to decide does it makes sense to extend that line past there why or why not	9.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Hey back to me please	1.0
	Kaya I noticed already walked up there and extended the line and if you put maybe an arrow on the end of that line it just would show what do you think would show	8.0
	What would that show	8.0
	Why did she put the arrows on there Eva	3.0
	Its showing that that line keeps going	1.0
	It keeps going its extending it but why did you decide to do that Kaya	9.0
How do you pronounce the name	Id say Lilith	1.0
It shows you the passage of time where their age is going to be	I see a lot of people agreeing	1.0
	Because theyre not always going to just be just these ages in theory theyre going to live nice long lives until their hundreds	1.0
	Theyre going to keep going theyre not going to be just these ages nice job	1.0
	How old was Noah when Lilith was six	8.0
	Thank you lets give Kaya a round of applause	1.0
	How old was Noah when Lilith was six	8.0
	When you have an answer ready stand up please	2.0
	Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner its partner Bs turn to go first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Hey back to me please thank you	1.0
	Mikel will you go up and show us how you got your answer please	8.0
	Were going to see if we agree with his thinking and see his method	1.0
What I said was when Lilith was six Noah was two because if you go to the six and to the line you can see that Noahs age is going to be two because they both meet up at this area	Where the six is for the Xaxis	2.0
Yes	People are agreeing	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	I like the way you used your graph would that work for other problems do you think	2.0
Yes	Yes anything thats still on this particular grid	5.0
	I wonder why youre not adding arrows did you have a reason for that	9.0
	Its there there you go sorry its hard to see on there	1.0
	Nice you lets give Mikel a round of applause	1.0
	Lets try another one	1.0
	First of SS I got the same Im so confused	1.0
	SS right thank you	1.0
	Lets try this one whats Noahs age when Lilith was six and a half	8.0
	SS right give me a thumbs up if youre ready to share your thinking	2.0
	Great youre sharing with your shoulder partners partner Bs turn to share their thinking	8.0
	Make sure you not only give an answer you show how you got your answer	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go partner B	2.0
	Hey back to me please	1.0
	Lets see how this works Garret	8.0
	Give it to Garret	1.0
	You can take your partner if you want	1.0
	It always feels better to have somebody with us sometimes were not as confident	1.0
	I know I always liked having a partner	1.0
	One question I want to ask you is is there a reason you didnt extend your line	9.0
I forgot	Okay can you guys loan him a template real quick	1.0
	Can you see why were going to extend it	2.0
Because theyre growing	Theyre growing exactly	5.0
	Theyre going to keep growing	1.0
	In theory most of us do hopefully	1.0
	Good job I like how hes being reSSy precise	1.0
	SS right the floors SS yours	1.0
	So Lilith is six and a half how old is Noah	8.0
	Lets think of a question we could ask Garret to help him	1.0
	Whats a question you could ask	3.0
	Pick somebody to give you a question thatll help you	3.0
How old was Noah when Lilith was six	What are you thinking Reese	8.0
	Tell us what youre thinking	1.0
I went to six and seven I went between because she was between those I guess then suddenly I went over and I got two so Noah would be two	I see some people thinking youre right and some people thinking youre not exactly right	1.0
	I thought you were trying to coach Garret on the question that was asked so were going in two directions here	1.0
	Lets finish responding to Reese and then well go back to Garret and Rodies question	1.0
	Pick somebody thats showing you this Reese	3.0
I might have said somebodys name wrong I dont know	No it has nothing to do with the name	1.0
	Do you hear that we just found out that when Lilith was six that Noah was two and now youre saying Lilith is six and a half and you say Noah is still two	2.0
	Does that make sense	2.0
No	Lets help Garret here Rodie tell him your question again	3.0
How old was Noah when Lilith was six	Put your finger on the six on the Xaxis and go up until it meets the line that youve drawn there so move up	1.0
	Now go across to the Yaxis go there and whats the number on the edge	8.0
Two	Two do you see how to figure out Noahs age	2.0
Yes	Okay so now Lilith is six and a half so wheres six and a half	8.0
In between six and seven	There you go so follow that same process	1.0
	Go up until you get to that line and then go left to the Yaxis two and a half what do you think	8.0
	Emma you need to stop Garrets talking	1.0
	Nice jobs	1.0
	I get this Im ready to just turn me loose I need some more practice	1.0
	If youre like this and your partner is like this then you join me at the table	1.0
	If youre like this but your partner is like this you can work and check and coach or  but if youre both like this I want to see you up at the table so I can coach you	1.0
	Barun	2.0
	Then you can work and check	1.0
	Youre going to do I cant read that page number 138 139 ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	A round of applause for Garret and Reese	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	What did you learn from the feedback from Garret	3.0
I learned that	Do you see how when she was six we put our finger here and we move up to the line and then we move forward	2.0
Yes	Okay so six and a half was here we go up to here go over and its two and a half	1.0
	Maybe using this might help you	1.0
	Heres seven and a half and then you can turn it and go Now I see how I do it	1.0
	Do you want to try another one of these before you start your work	2.0
	Liliths age when Noah was one and a half	1.0
	Heres Noah wheres one and a half	8.0
	Good so when you put this here look at one and a half not lets turn here from this and we plot with that one	1.0
	Its between five and six	1.0
So its five and a half	Do you see how you use this	2.0
Yes	Are you okay	2.0
Yes	With this	2.0
	Okay is Noah ever going to reach up to Nora	2.0
No	So its a constant they stay in that same point	1.0
	Its just a constant its the same thing SS right	2.0
	Im not hearing people working and checking	1.0
	Make sure youre working and checking please	1.0
	So you guys dont have a new one	2.0
Yes	Why dont you just do a new one then everybody can have their own copy	1.0
	Did you guys already do Ls	2.0
Yes	Okay	1.0
	I know	1.0
	Me too	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Are you ready	2.0
Yes	Please do not just get up and leave	1.0
	Please do not	1.0
	Lets go back to our learning intentions superduper quick before you go so that we can make sure I have this information	1.0
	Youre supposed to be able to form ordered pairs graph them and interpret coordinate values in context within a situation	1.0
	How do you know youve made it	8.0
	Write ordered pairs correctly	1.0
	Show me how well you can do that	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Graph them accurately	1.0
	Show me how well you can do that please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Answer questions related to the data	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	My choir friends make sure you take your casts and I dont know if you need your coats too	1.0
	Probably	1.0
	Take your coats and have fun	1.0
	and well see you later okay	1.0
	Bye	1.0
May the force be with you	Bye you guys have fun	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Do you need help carrying stuff	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	SS right	1.0
		1.0
	All right	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Is there anything about the homework that needs	1.0
	Fabulous	1.0
	How well you were able to complete fraction problems independently last night for your homework	1.0
	Team four were waiting for you	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Good job you guys	1.0
	Way to go because you didnt use that knowledge today and apply it in some more work	1.0
	Im glad youre feRogeng successful	1.0
	Can you please stand up in the center of your team	1.0
	Before we start today were going to do the stray	1.0
	Hey who would like to stray	1.0
	If you are person one in your team gather up all of your math things and stray person one thank you	1.0
	Okay where are we	1.0
	There we go	1.0
	Thank you nice	1.0
	It always feels good how people call you out	1.0
	Its like	1.0
	Lets have person number three please	1.0
	You are  Hudson	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Awesome	1.0
	Now we have our brand new team awesome	1.0
	encouraging one another	1.0
	Lets start with  today	1.0
	You are going to round numbers	1.0
	So were going to  you can see it	1.0
	Does that help	2.0
	Round 873 to the nearest whole number	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Way to go everybody is saying 87	1.0
	Thats the next largest whole number  were rounding to the next whole number thats right here	1.0
	Round 9912 to the nearest tenth	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Way to go people are saying 991	1.0
	Ill have you explain your thinking about that rounding to your face partner	1.0
	Partner A please explain yourself	8.0
	Raise your hand if youre partner A	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	That would be people one and three	1.0
	You are explaining to your face partner how you rounded that	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Round 318 to the nearest tenth	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Way to go everybody say that number	8.0
32	Way to go	1.0
	Were done	1.0
	Lets go to another one	1.0
	Round 715 to the nearest tenth	1.0
	And flash	1.0
	Okay everybody say this	8.0
72	Why is it 72	9.0
	Hudson	2.0
So youre	What five or more What place value are you talking about	1.0
	You got to start real sequential	1.0
	What place value do I look at	8.0
Im looking at the hundredths place and its a five so you have to round	Why do you have to round up if its a five	9.0
I was looking at the tenths place and then if you look to the hundredths place you know that you have to round up because five or more	Why does five or more raises forward	9.0
	So anything coupling in between you round up to the next place value	2.0
I knew that you would round off the one in the tenths place will become a two so it will be 72	Thank you	1.0
	Much more specific way to go Hudson	1.0
	72 by this one	1.0
	Read the number with me	8.0
	Round	1.0
882186 to the nearest hundredths	And flash	1.0
	Its partner Bs turn to explain	2.0
	That would be person two and person four explain to your partner	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Try this oneRound 78005 to the nearest hundredth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Nice job if you rounded that to 78	1.0
	Round 0055 to the nearest tenth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Who says 01	1.0
	You read this one with me	8.0
98137 to the nearest thousandths	In flash	1.0
	Good	1.0
	Lets read that rounded number now	8.0
9814	Now	1.0
	Round 5009 to the nearest tenth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	If you said five youre on the right track	1.0
	I see some people that are writing 51	1.0
	What are those people doing incorrectly	3.0
	What is somebody doing if they wrote 51	3.0
	If youre the one that wrote 51 you go first at your team and explain	8.0
	If you dont have anybody at your team that did that mistake just pick somebody to explain what they did	1.0
	Rate how well you are rounding to specified places today	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	The relevance of rounding	1.0
	Whats the purpose of doing this	8.0
	Roge	2.0
The purpose of doing this is if you had to estimate something you could round that up to make an estimate	You know the meaning of rounding up right	2.0
Or rounded up	We could just use the word round right	2.0
	Rounding helps us estimate	1.0
	Estimates help us do what	8.0
	Why make an estimate Andrea	9.0
Because it helps you add or subtract better	In what ways	8.0
Because they could be equivalent	I dont understand what you mean	1.0
	It could be equivalent	1.0
	What do you mean	8.0
Like it couldnt be easier because itd be closer to a number	Okay if you round a number you can get a mental idea	1.0
	Just a general idea of a number	1.0
	Good point	1.0
	Sometimes you do that	1.0
	Youre just rounding to estimate	1.0
	Im still lining the shelves in my kitchen	1.0
	I decided last night I dont think I have enough shelf lining	1.0
	I have to order more again from Amazon to finish lining it	1.0
	I made an estimate	1.0
	I didnt go to measure directly I rounded off	1.0
	Well youre going to need three more rolls of this	1.0
	What would be another reason that we want to make an estimate	8.0
	Vicki	2.0
Probably to	Bump a friend	1.0
	Get somebody to help you	1.0
	They dont have to have their hand up	1.0
	Pick somebody that you think will know why we make an estimate	1.0
	Finish your thinking	1.0
	River was pretty much sure and she didnt let you finish	1.0
	I think that threw you	1.0
	Youre solving a problem thats kind of big	1.0
	You make an estimate because	9.0
	Yes youre totally on the right track	1.0
	You solve a problem you want to check through reasonable limits	1.0
	Exactly thank you	1.0
	Lets try a math message here	1.0
	Youre going to complete problems one and two on journal page 169	1.0
	Look carefully at your answer and then finally talk to your partner about what you noticed	1.0
	First you work independently	1.0
	Then you look carefully	1.0
	Then you talk to your partner about what you noticed	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Were going to go over the learning intention	1.0
	You guys will help Mr Oliver today right	2.0
Yes	Can we go over this piece of vocabulary before we do the learning intention	1.0
	This is what we were talking about yesterday at the very end of math	1.0
	Unit practice	1.0
	I dont  some fractional number but okay	1.0
	Its a number written as a fraction where the numerator is one and the denominator is a positive integer	1.0
	Look at these examples	1.0
	What do you notice about all the examples	8.0
	They all have a one in the numerator right	2.0
	That means its a unit	1.0
	One unit is one in the numerator because its 12 its 14 its 17 its 116	1.0
	Smoked chocolate here	1.0
	Face partner what is the unit fraction	8.0
	Ready go	2.0
	All right	1.0
	What is a unit fraction	8.0
	I love the graphics on this because theyre really good	1.0
	That helps you	1.0
	What is a unit fraction Charlie	8.0
If you take 14 thats one unit as a whole	Love your explanation	1.0
	You want to come to our team planning and help us write these	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets now transition to our learning intention for today	1.0
	Real quickly	1.0
I can discuss and apply strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers	Discuss	1.0
	Give me a gesture	2.0
	Yes you can talk I see some people	1.0
	Great acting over there Margo thank you	1.0
	Youre going to talk about it and youre going to apply strategies	1.0
	What does a strategy mean Asher	8.0
A strategy like a way of doing things	Like the way youve explained that	1.0
	Youre going to have a way of doing something	1.0
	To multiply fractions show me that	1.0
	This by whole numbers today	1.0
	Yes a whole number	1.0
	Is there going to be a fraction with it	2.0
	Is it going to be a mixed number	2.0
No	Yesterday we were multiplying fractions by fractions	1.0
	Today were going to be multiplying by whole numbers for typical learning intentions	1.0
	This is how youre going to know youre successful	1.0
	When you can apply one of the strategies	1.0
	Because were going to talk about a couple today in order for you to solve some problems	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Did you finish your math message	2.0
Yes	Did you talk with your partner	2.0
	Im going to have you talk with your partner about your work	1.0
	Let me give you one minute	1.0
	Okay what are your strategies	8.0
	What is one strategy	8.0
	For problem one I should say specifically	1.0
	Im sorry	1.0
	I was too vague	1.0
	I apologize for interrupting you	1.0
	What was your strategy for problem one	8.0
	You want to finish your explanation	2.0
	What do you think of his thinking	3.0
	When I heard your thinking I was thinking of when we put the calendars under the document camera and show the groups of five 15 broken into five groups	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	That was definitely one strategy	1.0
	Who has a different strategy than that	3.0
	Whats another strategy Roge	8.0
So thats the strategy I used	You want to connect to that Margo	3.0
Youre just kind of going backwards moving out to the end	I think youre noticing what were supposed to be talking about	1.0
	What do you notice and thats what youre noticing	1.0
	Its the same thing	1.0
	But just showing you two different ways of doing it right	2.0
Yes	Imagine I gave you another in number will the outnumber be the same for both labels	2.0
	Ill give you another in number	1.0
	Do the same for both	1.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Its time to talk with your shoulder partner please	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Roge would it be the same for both	2.0
Because youre doing the same	Im going to let Rebecca help you with the explanation	3.0
	She was doing a great job explaining it but then youre going to explain it after you hear her explain it	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Lets have Rebecca go for first	1.0
Yes	Thats why theyre both the inner	2.0
Yes	Very clear	1.0
	Now you get a chance to say that	1.0
Its the same as saying 15	Multiplying by 15	5.0
by five youre just breaking it into five different parts	Well done thank you	1.0
	Hold on a second here	1.0
	Whats the division rule that we learned earlier this year when we were talking about division	8.0
	I showed you this and we talked about it as division	1.0
	What was that division role	8.0
	I see some people going	1.0
	They dont remember	1.0
	Raise your hand if you remember that division role	2.0
	Go ahead	1.0
	Talk at your teams	2.0
	People that remember go first	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	If youve talked about it this would be 1 5	1.0
	The numerator divided by the denominator	1.0
	Thats another way of thinking about this	1.0
	All right the numerator divided by the denominator	1.0
	What if I have this 23 I dont like that	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	I dont want to get that big	1.0
	Lets say 85 No I dont want to say that either	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Im not good at coming up with these off the top of my head	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	I want to do one that you can see really easily I saw an example when I was reading through the lesson that was really helpful	1.0
	What if I have 274	8.0
	What would that be	8.0
	Do it on your slate	1.0
	Express your remainder as a fraction	1.0
	274	1.0
	Class remember express your answer	1.0
	Oh goodness we have some interesting ideas here	1.0
	Save your answers	1.0
	Im gonna put something on the board	1.0
	I have 6 34	1.0
	Hold your answers	1.0
	I have people that just wrote the equation like this	1.0
	I said to solve it	1.0
	I have somebody had said 6 14 and somebody that says 5 34	1.0
	I want you to talk about these with your teams please	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Of those hopefully  6 34 is the correct answer	1.0
	The person that got 5 34 looks like they probably just divided incorrectly more than likely	1.0
	Same with the person with 6 14 they didnt really put the right remainder	1.0
	Then the person that says 274 they set up the problem but they didnt actually solve it	1.0
	Im just reminding you of this division rule all right	2.0
	When you see a fraction you can also think about it as division	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Look at the rules for problem three and four again	1.0
	Wow we havent even done that	1.0
	Hold on	1.0
	Where am I disconnected here	8.0
	Look at problems three and four on your page	1.0
	Examine the rules for problem three and four	1.0
	The in numbers are the same for both	1.0
	Do you see that	2.0
	Do you think these rules will produce the same out numbers	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	If youre a team of three make sure youre rotating sharing going on please	1.0
	Talk with your shoulder partner	2.0
	Do you think the out numbers will be the same	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Is the strategy going to be What have I asked you	8.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Do you think these rules will produce the same out number	2.0
	Why or why not	9.0
	Jodie	2.0
because we think it would be because 15  15 would be the same thing as 1 divided by 5  35 would be the same as 3 divided by 5	Thank you	1.0
	I see somebody wants to add on	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Relate yesterdays work to problem three	1.0
	What did we do to solve problem three yesterday	8.0
	The other partner turned their  first	2.0
	What did we do yesterday to solve problems like one and number three	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	What was the strategy we used yesterday to solve problems like number three	8.0
	Andrew	2.0
What we did is we used a unit fraction to find Just to find the regular one and then we did times the numerator so we can see if 35 of 15	I agree I just dont like the part about the regular one	5.0
	What do you mean by regular one	8.0
I mean like when you do the whole number times the unit fraction is kind of like	Youre finding the product of    15 and then multiplying that times 3 because you have three of those	1.0
	Maybe thats just some finetuning of vocabulary	1.0
	I get that rule	1.0
	I need to talk about it some more	1.0
	Youre going to write down the two strategies	1.0
	Weve talked about two strategies	1.0
	Bradategies	1.0
	Think of fraction problems that was yesterdays work	1.0
	Writing that strategy we just talked about	1.0
	Then today interpreting the fraction as division	1.0
	Thats what we just talked about also	1.0
	Those are the two different rules	1.0
	You can work as a team to come up with the explanation	1.0
	You have four minutes to do this	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	My bad	1.0
	You probably should solve questions three and four to help you come up with a strategy	1.0
	If you solve the problems itll help you word the strategy	1.0
	especially for strategy two	1.0
	I feel like strategy one I  but not number two	1.0
	Make sure you get problems three and four	1.0
	find the denominator	1.0
	See how many groups and the denominator can go into  whole number and  Yes	1.0
	number 15 x 3 45 divided by five is	8.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets talk about strategy one	1.0
	Id like somebody to   lots of people willing to explain that strategy and throw it under there	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Yes the written	1.0
	Theres people that are like this	1.0
	divide the  number	1.0
	Are they always going to be  the numbers	2.0
	Are they always going to be remember our learning intention is dividing whole numbers by fractions or multiplying	1.0
	Were dividing  multiply	1.0
	Thats why Im confused	1.0
	Were multiplying whole numbers by fractions	1.0
	Youre going to divide the whole number by I cant read it	1.0
	Are you going to divide it by a rule	2.0
	What part of the fraction are you going to divide it by	8.0
	What part of that fraction	8.0
	The numerator	2.0
	Lets try it	1.0
	15 divided by three is three and then	1.0
	Yes because youre really dividing to find the whats that vocabulary word	8.0
	Youre diving to find the unit fraction	1.0
	Youre trying to find what 110 is	1.0
	When you divide by 5 youre finding what 110 is	1.0
	Id like you to move	1.0
	Find a new place	1.0
	New team	1.0
	Find what 15 is and then what do you do once you find what 15 is	8.0
	Show me	1.0
	What do you do once you find what 15 is	8.0
	Multiply by	8.0
	By the numerator right	2.0
	Good try Marvin	1.0
	Way to be up there and trying	1.0
	Im very proud of you	1.0
	Who else would like to throw their rule under there	8.0
	Hopefully its something we can read because that was really hard to see	1.0
	Thank you Jodie	1.0
	Can you take yours under please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
the whole number	We want to say you divide the whole number	5.0
Divide the denominator of the rule then you take that number and multiply it by the numerator	I feel like its better but it still has some things	1.0
	What are something Shes done a good job but what are some tweaks	3.0
	Whats something that you could ask her	3.0
	Is it always going to be a rule number	2.0
No	Whats it going to be	8.0
Its going to be like the thing youre multiplying it by	Whats the thing that were multiplying by today	8.0
Fractions	Fractions changing the world rule by the denominator of the fraction then take that number and multiply it by the numerator of that fraction	5.0
	Do you see your three fix ups	2.0
Yes	All right	1.0
	Round of applause	1.0
	Nicely done	1.0
	I see several people that dont have the second part finished	1.0
	Please finish that after you see other peoples examples	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Who can explain the strategy to the second one	8.0
	They have it written out	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Lets see yours Andrea	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Youre gonna get an idea for looking at someone elses work	1.0
	Can you fill it in from seeing that	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Should your math journal be open	1.0
	Should you be looking at yours to see Gosh am I making sense	1.0
	I see Jodie there modifying hers based on the feedback	1.0
	Thats what Im asking people to do	1.0
	Look at your work and modify as needed	1.0
They said multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	Can you move it up so we can see it too and read it	1.0
	No there you go	1.0
	Close getting better	1.0
	There you go	1.0
	Now read it again	2.0
Multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator	Shes got parts of this definitely right	1.0
	She has parts	1.0
	Good job using vocabulary but theres some feedback	1.0
	Call on people that are trying to give you some feedback	1.0
	Multiply the whole number by the numerator	1.0
	You dont agree with that	3.0
	Shes saying Can you move it down a little bit so we can see the example and your strategy	1.0
	Lets try it	1.0
	15  3 is 45 times 5	1.0
	Gosh I cant do that one in my head	1.0
	That would be like 50  5	1.0
	That would be	1.0
	Yes is that really what you mean	2.0
	Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction and then by the denominator of the fraction	2.0
the denominator	She figured it out	1.0
	Yay good job	1.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Thats awesome	1.0
	Especially scary when youre up at the front in the camera	1.0
	Way to go Andrea	1.0
	Way to keep your composure	1.0
	Then the same the numerator of the fraction	1.0
	Everybody have the rule written down now	2.0
Yes	You are going to look at page 170 please	1.0
	Look at 13	1.0
	No number one	1.0
	Theres a 13 in it	1.0
	Read the directions for A with me	2.0
Show your work	That could be computation	1.0
	Could it be a drawing	2.0
	Yes	1.0
	Which strategy is that that we were just writing about on the previous page	8.0
	Show me	1.0
	Is that strategy one or strategy two	2.0
	Thats strategy one its what we were doing yesterday	1.0
	Now read B	2.0
Show your work	That could also be computation	1.0
	Could it be a picture	2.0
	Possibly	1.0
	Youre working with your partner	1.0
	When you are finished go to math boxes	1.0
	Dont keep going on this page	1.0
	I want to look at this work	1.0
	Yes	2.0
	Shoulder partner obviously	1.0
	Its kind of hard to do drawings and stuff together across the table	1.0
	Working with your shoulder partner or your trio	1.0
	Do problem one then go to math boxes	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Go to the picture to show that	1.0
	Were going to have some people throw their work under here lets have someone that made a picture for 1A	1.0
	Who made a picture they can show us	2.0
	Good lots of volunteers	1.0
	Marcus	2.0
	Way to go	1.0
	Are we looking at our work	2.0
	No were looking at hers and were thinking about it	1.0
	Were thinking hard	1.0
I used the strategy number one	This is actually B your answer is for B	1.0
	This is the answer for B where youre showing thinking about it as division	1.0
	Im going to have you save this for now okay	1.0
	You can come back up way to go for B you got that	1.0
	You need some idea for A	1.0
	Who made a picture for A thank you	1.0
	Lets go Margo	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
Then I got my answer 8 and 23	Im  you guys all seem to get it but Im struggling Im trying	1.0
	Yours is very similar to what I did with them but can you explain it again	8.0
	Im sorry	1.0
	Youre confused too	2.0
	Go again those of us that are  more time can look at it	1.0
I was able to split it into four whole groups	No I dont see how thats four whole groups	5.0
You would have three	I see the three groups as the three columns	1.0
Yes	Theres four in each group of three	2.0
Yes and each one of these would be part of	Can you show us the three groups	8.0
This is one group	Good	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
Two groups and three groups	Thank you	1.0
Then for each group you would have a third with the group as well	Thats the 13th one	1.0
Yes	Thank you	1.0
Then put two of those you would have eight thats eight full  and then two thirds	Now your picture makes way more sense to me	1.0
	I did not understand it the way you had it before unfortunately Im sorry but that was very clear	1.0
	Round of applause beautiful	1.0
	Now lets let Marcus go up and show us because she had strategy two up there for strategy one	1.0
	Thats the strategy one where you find the unit fraction and multiply it by the numerator because you had 23 not just 13	1.0
	Nice job	1.0
	Now Marcuss explaining the division part	8.0
That was	Do you want to go back figure this out and come back	2.0
	I know you know what youre doing Im seeing that but I know	1.0
	Can we pause this and come back to it and just finish this one problem then tomorrow	1.0
	Are guys okay with that	1.0
Yes	Thank you	1.0
	Were going to go to the library	1.0
	Just understand today when we go to the library we	1.0
Yes	Except what they do with the little microphone on your desks	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	You guys watched the video right	2.0
	Did everybody get to see the video	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Well maybe you didnt get to see it	1.0
	What were going to be working on is octagon	1.0
	Youre going to be working on comparing decimals	1.0
	I can use place value strategies to compare decimals to the thousandths	1.0
	Ill give you two different strategies	1.0
	Im going to share one with you and then Im going to show you what this paper that I gave you how it can be helpful	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Youre going to look at each place values starting up with tenths	1.0
	The tenths is where	8.0
	You have your desk Mo where is the tenths	1.0
	Is it the first one the second one the third one	8.0
	Its the first one	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Youre going to compare it to the other number	1.0
	Youre going to look at both numbers in the tenths	1.0
	If one is bigger then that numbers bigger	1.0
	If theyre the same then you go to the hundredths	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	If theyre the same then you go to the thousandths	1.0
	As soon as one is bigger then that makes that number bigger	1.0
	Okay	1.0
You dont have to worry about the other numbers	Okay	1.0
	The first one we have 34hundredths and we have 248thousandths	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	I want you to start which one is bigger	8.0
Seven	Its on your paper	1.0
	Its the first one	1.0
	Everybody look at the first one	1.0
	Which is bigger 34hundredths or 248thousandths	8.0
	Hold on	1.0
	Were going to pass this around and then say it in this	1.0
Im going to say	Is that your race	1.0
	Catalina is that your race assignment	1.0
	Is there an easy way you get her the homework 44	1.0
Im going for 0248	Okay and which one did you say Andy 248	2.0
Im going for 248	What	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Melly	2.0
	Which one figure	8.0
	Which one 248thousandths or 34hundredths	8.0
34hundredths	Okay	1.0
34thousandths	You dont have one	1.0
	Is it this top one	2.0
	34hundredths or 248thousandths	8.0
34thousandths	Okay	1.0
	Give it to Frankie	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	We had mixed answers	1.0
	What were going to do on this paper that I gave you is we are going to color with three different colors and then were going to see if we have the same answer	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Yes on this	1.0
	On the first one take your first color and if in the tenths place we have three for 34hundredths	1.0
	Color three tenths	1.0
	Thats a whole row	1.0
	For 34hundredths were following three tenths	1.0
	We need three whole rows	1.0
Does it matter with the little lines	See how were doing Mia	2.0
I know but this if were going to ever use most	We will	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Then once you have your three rows in your first color your second color youre going to do four boxes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	All like you were doing but now four of them	1.0
	Let me show you one	1.0
	Theres one of them	1.0
Like that	Im going to do four of those	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Right there thats 34hundredths	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Now were going to do 248thousandths	1.0
	How many long ones do we have to do	8.0
Two	Two	4.0
	Well now were in a new box	1.0
	Right next to it were going to do two	1.0
	Two full rows because this one in the tenth it shows two	1.0
	Were going to do two full rows	1.0
	Okay lets keep going	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	After that how many boxes are we going to color next with a different color	8.0
Four boxes	Four boxes	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now this one we didnt have any ittybitty tiny ones but this one we do	1.0
Eight	Okay	1.0
	Were going to do eight ittybitty ones	5.0
Itty bitty lines	See thats two	1.0
The lines	The ittybitty boxes	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Ittybitty thats tiny ones	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now were going to go around to here and I want you to look at it and see which has more	1.0
	If this was a cake which person has more cake	8.0
	Either this one	1.0
	Were going to say this is 34hundredths or 248thousandths	1.0
	Okay	1.0
The first one	Which is	8.0
	Okay	1.0
The first one	Okay	1.0
Second one	Okay	1.0
	Lets look at this	1.0
	In our cake we have three full rows	1.0
	This one we only have two rows	1.0
	Doesnt this one have more	2.0
	This one has three full rows	1.0
	Do you see it	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Here when we go back to this paper 34hundredths is bigger	1.0
	When we go to this paper and we said this even though she picks the other one both times she said this you look at the first number	1.0
	Which ones bigger	8.0
	The three or the two	8.0
Three	Three	4.0
	Right there that tells us that ones going to be bigger	1.0
	She said she saw that in the video and then she picked a two	1.0
	No I thought	1.0
	I thought when I was  I thought I did three on this one and two on this one	1.0
	Okay so on the alligator mouth which decimal is bigger were going to put the alligator mouth facing the 34	1.0
Smaller it is I guess bigger it is	Well in this case it does 34 does look smaller but in the video they also talked about if theres nothing there you can put a zero there and now 340 Shirley is bigger than 248	5.0
	If I add a zero there okay so how did we know that this one was bigger	8.0
Because of do you want strike that	No I want you to tell me why	1.0
Oh because	Shes telling us what we should write	1.0
Well so I think what we should write is that 34 zero decimal wait how else we say that	This is thirty four hundred	1.0
the The second grade that we did was two rows of boxes and a row of tinny boxes but even thought that the second number is bigger the first number was Even though the second number is bigger the 248 is bigger than 34 then in on decimalwise 34 was bigger than 248	Right so	1.0
Thats a lot to write but	Yes thats so Im going to condense it down	1.0
	Looking at the three in the tenths is bigger than the two in the tenths and that would show that there and here so here is what I want you to write	1.0
	Are you ready guys	2.0
	The three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths of 24thousandths	1.0
Than the tenths	Okay so the three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths	1.0
tenths of	Okay so I put it right there so you guys can see it	1.0
	Okay so were going to look at the next one	1.0
	We have one and two tenths and 25hundredths	1.0
	So which one is bigger	8.0
	This time well start with Dangelo and well go this way	1.0
Wait what	Which one is bigger than the one and the two tenths or 25hundredths	8.0
Wait can you come back soon I want to do it on here	Okay the problem with doing it on here is theres a whole number so youre going to have one whole box and then two long ones and this one you have Okay	1.0
	Leahs going to start	2.0
I think the first one now	Lets start	1.0
Okay	All right so let me show you on our thing where the first mic	1.0
	Okay so on my grid for the first one Im going to have to color one whole because it has one and two tenths so this is just one and then the other one is 20	1.0
So the whole box	The whole box plus two more and the other one The other one looks like this	5.0
	Heres the first one both of these boxes and heres the second one	1.0
	The first one has a whole box and then part of the box and then this one just has two more	1.0
Speaker 2 This got the whole box	MsCarroll This is a whole thing	5.0
	First is this so this is a whole This is one and two tenths	1.0
	Isaiah are you done and youre done with all of yesterdays pages too	2.0
	Okay so the first one is bigger because it has a whole number so we know that one is bigger because it has a whole number	1.0
	All right now using this put them in order from biggest to smallest	1.0
	Which one out of these four is the biggest	8.0
	Write that first	1.0
so do you know	Right	1.0
	Down here it says then smallest From largest to smallest	1.0
	Youre going to put them in order and then heres the table	1.0
	If the table helps you its right here	1.0
	Okay so right here Cardo were doing this one right here	1.0
Is it	Oh yes	1.0
	This needs to be fixed	1.0
	The decimal is in the wrong place	1.0
	Okay so I want you guys to fill up this down here	1.0
	The very bottom one	1.0
	Okay so you can this and you can use your paper so you start here	1.0
	Is there any that are bigger than any others	2.0
One	Okay so thats your first biggest ones	1.0
	You got to put 12	1.0
	No it goes the decimal is before it	1.0
	Okay when you have that done you can hand it to me okay because I want to look at it and make sure youre doing it right	1.0
The thing is the biggest numbers	Okay with that you can go back to your seat	1.0
Is it okay that first off why did you Then you offered here	Yes	1.0
	Welcome back	1.0
	Are you safe	1.0
Yes I am fine now	We have a church and so we videotape the stuff and so I might use it for that and so I was kind of attracted to getting the swivel just as much as iPad and Ive never had a tablet because my phone does anything I  a laptop	1.0
Yes pretty really thats all you really need	I think with traveling if I need something a little more convenient than trying to answer email on a phone	1.0
	All right guys lets have a seat please	1.0
	If you can turn your desks for our team time	1.0
	Brittany zack and Chase your tests are here	1.0
	Sorry I didnt get them	1.0
	We passed him back before	1.0
	Here you go	1.0
	All right our team numbers	1.0
	Team one is closest to the door two three then it comes back up here four five six seven and eight	1.0
	What do you see	1.0
	What teams get to pick up our microphone	1.0
	Team three	1.0
	Team seven	1.0
	Its you guys	1.0
	Are they ready	2.0
	Team five	1.0
	Thats right in the middle	1.0
	Okay team four	1.0
	If you would please be very cautious with the microphones so that they dont get broken or dropped or anything like that because theyre just a wee bit expensive	1.0
	It looks like were recording	1.0
	Liz what do you think	1.0
	Are we recording over there	1.0
What do you think Liz	We have success	1.0
	Thank you for turning those on	1.0
	Will you turn the light on back there too	1.0
	This was the Makeup quiz so if you didnt like your score on the online quiz you could do the one in the books so if youve done that just put it in the basket	1.0
	I wanted to put these up here again just in case	1.0
	You might have actually thought of a question between yesterday and today about any of this	1.0
	So any question about our tests thats on Tuesday	2.0
	Jordan for you no calculator everybody else you can have your calculator	1.0
Are we allowed to use the new books	Toolkits we dont use on the tests	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
	Anybody planning on doing the retake of year one you need to make sure you let me know so that I prepare and have copies of the retake in separate classes	1.0
	Any questions on the retake from our first test	2.0
	Any questions about what math class that you need to sign up for	2.0
	You can take this and AP stats if you want but its not recommended	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Right	1.0
	How that works is you take the Front Range class and I think its Miss Butler that youd have to talk to	1.0
	Shell tell you the specific class	1.0
	You would still sign up for this and then after the summer you take the trig precalc final pass that and then you could skip that and start cal fit	1.0
	The other requirement is that you have all As in all the maths classes in high school	1.0
Is that the only class to do over the summer or is there like others	The only reason that I know about that class is just because some people do want to skip in from math three and then be able to take calculus	1.0
	Over the summer you mean	1.0
No just like	Its a yearlong	1.0
	Itll be a single class a single period	1.0
	From here on out you wont have any blocks	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Other questions	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	All ready	1.0
	If you would please pull out that blue piece of paper that we worked on yesterday	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lets put the problem number five first	1.0
	This is one of the problems where A is one	1.0
	The phrase we need to remember is factors of C that add up to B	1.0
	We look at our C value over here	1.0
	Our systematic way of looking at factors is to just start with one and then two and three and four and five and we stop when we notice we already have a number even if its the opposite sign in my list	1.0
	This is a systematic way not to miss any of those and then with that set we also switch the signs	1.0
	The positive becomes negative and the negative becomes positive so well always have two sets to choose from	1.0
	Then we want to find the one that adds up to B and so we look at these add them up and see which one it is	1.0
	Then we absolutely have it easy because those numbers get stuck over here into our intercept form	1.0
	What kind of intercepts are we talking about	8.0
Xintercepts	Xintercepts	5.0
	That makes it easy then when we want to find our Xintercepts because whats always true about an Xintercept	8.0
Y is zero	Y is zero	4.0
	If my Y is zero if this is supposed to equal zero one of those two factors has to be zero	1.0
	The work we show is modeled here its called the zero product property	1.0
	Product means we are multiplying so we have our answer as zero a zero product property	1.0
	We set it equal to zero and solve	1.0
	This is the kind of work you need to be used to doing	1.0
	Then the Yintercept whats always true about a Yintercept	8.0
X is zero	X is zero so it doesnt matter	5.0
	You could plug zero into here and immediately know what it is or you could put zero in here and we just be multiplying two times 5 and we come up with the same answer	1.0
	Now since level three or any constructed response problem is a communication between the two of us you have to show me work	1.0
	Now this looks like Do I really need to show work for this	1.0
	Yes show at least one step	1.0
	It doesnt matter to me which one of the two standard or vertex forms you use but you should do something or lets just even say Y instead of F of X for this since were finding the Y value	1.0
	Just plug in zero for X and thats good enough to show the work for that	1.0
	That would just means you know how to go about doing the math for that	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Any questions on the intercepts	2.0
	All right it sounds like the good time for person number three	1.0
	If youre person number three raise your hand	2.0
	That is you Jordan	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Person number three explain what weve done so far in factoring in finding the intercepts	1.0
	Not right now but today when we are done	1.0
Those two factors are	All right	1.0
	Person number four survey your team are there any questions in your team that nobodys asked yet	2.0
	Person number four	2.0
	All right eyes upright please	1.0
	All right any residual questions on either of those factoring or finding intercepts	2.0
	Yes sir	2.0
How did we make originally it was 10 so what do we do to make that 10	Up here	1.0
	On the paper is it negative or positive	8.0
Negative	Oh it is negative okay	5.0
When we were doing the example yesterday that we took notes on	Right that was a different problem	1.0
Yes	It was just but it was different	1.0
	It just so it happened that both of the C values had a 10	1.0
Both the axis have a three	Yes is that right	2.0
Yes	All right so any other questions	2.0
	All right so lets keep looking at this example	1.0
	If I know my two Xintercepts I know those two thats what Ive figured out so far and I know this guy down here my Yintercept	1.0
	What do I know about my line of symmetry	8.0
Its in the center of those	If its in the center of those how do I find the center	8.0
Average the root	We are going to average the root	5.0
	Remember root is just another name for Xintercepts and on the calculator the calculator uses the term zeros	1.0
	Zeros Xintercept root all mean the same thing were just to average them	1.0
	Now what if we werent able to factor it what do we do then	8.0
	We use the opposite of B over 2A	1.0
	Thats the same thing	1.0
	Thats the first part of that quadratic formula is right here	1.0
	This is the opposite of B over 2A	1.0
	Its our line of symmetry and we have to add something and subtract something from it to find our Xintercepts	1.0
	All right if we know the X value if we know our line of symmetry what do we do then to find the vertex	8.0
Plug the X value	Yes we just plug that X value into the equation to find out what the vertex is and do that calculation	5.0
	At that point we have one two three four points	1.0
	Those are the key points we would be looking for and because we know that line of symmetry we know this one and can graph that and then we just connect the dots	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Person number one survey your team find out if they have any questions about any of that starting from the top going down	2.0
	All right any questions	2.0
	All right problem number six	1.0
	The difference is our A value	1.0
	We dont have a 1 anymore	1.0
	Now back in the day I never heard about factoring by grouping when I was in high school	1.0
	I would do guess and check	1.0
	If I look at this first term my choices were either to multiply 6X times X or 2X times 3X	1.0
	Nice with these numbers I only had two options which to try to figure out	1.0
	Then Id look at this last term here and know that these two have to be multiplied to end up with this and Id just start guessing which combination of numbers that I would need	1.0
	Fortunately if youre pretty intuitive this might actually work for you but youve got to show me some kind of work that shows that you understand the things that you have to multiply together to get our first term the things we multiply together to get the last term and then its all about figuring out which combination would add to 1X here	1.0
	The system though that we have is to do factoring by grouping	1.0
	This phrase has only changed a little bit	1.0
	The factors of A times C so instead of saying the factors of C its the factors of A times C	1.0
	In fact if you just memorize this when A is 1 its still the same thing	1.0
	Actually this is probably the phrase to learn if youre going to learn just one	1.0
	The factors of A times C that add up to B	1.0
	A times C 12 list out all my factors do my second set find out what B is which one adds up and then the difference is that these two numbers are about how I split my linear term	1.0
	In other words those two numbers are not my factors those two numbers is how I split this because 3 and 4 they add up to 1	1.0
	If I have 3X and 4X of this I havent changed my equation or anything	1.0
	Thats what my standard format looks like	1.0
	Ive split my linear term into those two	1.0
	Then I look at these first two and say Well what could I factor out	1.0
	I can factor out the 3X and whats left behind is here	1.0
	This guy times this it has to equal that this guy times this is equal that then over here what can I factor out of this	8.0
	Once Ive done that notice that whats in parentheses is the same thing thats what were looking for	1.0
	Because then I can pull out of this and put it in front	1.0
	Once I pull this out and put it in front what am I left with	8.0
3X2	Its just that	1.0
	Theres my two factors	1.0
	Then I use that zero product property I said this guy equal to zero	1.0
	I said that guy equal to zero and solve	1.0
	Those are my two Xintercepts	1.0
	All right any questions on that part	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Then looking at the green my line of symmetry Ive got my two Xintercepts so I add them up and divide by 2 that gets a little trickier with the fractions so Ive got to convert these to a common denominator	1.0
	346 gives me the 16 and Im dividing by 2 and I wrote it this way because you might remember that when you divide you can change it to multiplication if you flip the second term so you copy change and flip	1.0
	I dont know if you might have heard that before	1.0
	Thats how it makes it a little bit easier when were working with dividing fractions	1.0
	If I know X how do I find Y I plug it in and I end up having my vertex and then Im ready to graph those points	1.0
	The key difference with this is this phrase right here and the factors of A times C then add it to B	1.0
	All right so questions on either of those	2.0
	In fact Ill put both of them up there	1.0
	If you want a photo of it feel free to grab your phone particularly so that you can capture that factoring part	1.0
	These should be mapped to toolkits that youve got	1.0
	All right you can go ahead and put that blue sheet of paper away and grab a journal and a textbook	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Page 54 in the journal	1.0
	All right person number two with a team	1.0
	All right person number two with the team	1.0
	Person number two you get to be the reader	1.0
	Read the essential questions but continue with the discussion of whats that blue word and the red word mean	1.0
	Person number two go	2.0
	All right let me have your attention	1.0
	Thank you for those of you that are being aggressive and going after this exploration as well but lets first make sure we understand what quadratic means	1.0
	Whats quadratic mean	8.0
Square	Say it again	2.0
Four points	Four points	4.0
	Kind of interesting right	2.0
	Because quad means what	8.0
Four	Where does the four come from when we think about a quadratic	8.0
	Because its X to what power	8.0
	I guess if we squared it and make a square its got four sides	1.0
	Square is four sides	1.0
	All right so quadratic were talking about the function family thats Y equals X squared	1.0
	What does it mean to model something	8.0
	Do you have a synonym for model	8.0
Replicate	Replicate display show	5.0
	Whats the math thing	8.0
	If were modeling it what are we trying to find	8.0
	Whats the answer look like	8.0
	Symbols a graph	1.0
	Were looking at an axis of symmetry	1.0
	Its an E word	1.0
Its an equation	Its an equation	4.0
	Before following something were trying to find the equation that matches the data we collected	1.0
	Thats the whole point about of this	1.0
	Luke you were so profound when you read that exploration	1.0
	Could you do us a favor and read through A	2.0
A	Yes start at the top but read through A	2.0
Is the value of a positive negative or zero explain	Now Im looking for like with a partner the graph shows	1.0
How much is the profit in a year	T T going through A	2.0
Explain	Weve been given a question about explain period	1.0
	Whats the P stands for	8.0
Profit	Profit	4.0
	Whats T stands for	8.0
Time	Time and	8.0
Period	What are we inputting and what are we outputting	8.0
	What do we input for this	8.0
T	T so were inputting the number of	8.0
Years	Years and then we find out	8.0
The profit	How much profit the company is making	5.0
	Notice my input is always what goes on my Xaxis my output is whats on my Y	1.0
	The A value positive negative or zero	8.0
Positive	You dont sound very convinced	1.0
Positive	Positive	4.0
	Its positive which means my parabola opens up or down	8.0
Up	Up and that makes me very happy because I really like positive things in my life	5.0
	All right so if it opens up do I have a min or a max	2.0
A minimum	A minimum value	5.0
	In this story person number three what does that minimum value mean	8.0
	Interpret the minimum value for this story	1.0
	Person number three go	1.0
	How many are here	8.0
	The minimum value shows me the lowest profit in that year	1.0
	Its a specific year	1.0
	Its a specific dollar value and its a specific year	1.0
	Now if I want to find out what year that is so which way is my year	8.0
	Is my year over there on the Y or is it on the X	8.0
X	If we want to find the year I want to find the X	5.0
	If Im given standard form how do I find the X value of the minimum	8.0
	You guys are too good	1.0
	Much better than my other class	1.0
	That first half of the quadratic formula tells me the X value of that minimum and then if I want to find out what the dollar value is I	8.0
Plug in	Plug it in	5.0
	Continuing on Part C Jordan Lets have you read	2.0
	Part C	1.0
Estimate the  with this profit	All right so if P is the same for both of those years when did they make the least profit	8.0
	Somebody said 2008	1.0
	Another 2008	5.0
	Were thinking 2008 so if P profit is the same that represents a horizontal line	1.0
	Just to kind of make it fit with our graph would at these two times make profit be the same	2.0
	Yes	1.0
Yes	When did I make the least	8.0
In the between	In between those two	5.0
	Im averaging them again	1.0
	That year then is	8.0
		4.0
	Add them up divide by two	1.0
	Chase D please	2.0
	All listen up	1.0
Explain	What year are we in today	8.0
		2.0
	So are the profits increasing decreasing or staying constant	8.0
Increasing	Increasing	4.0
	Does this keep increasing	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	We can answer the question that today their profits should be increasing if thats a good model	1.0
	Anything particularly tricky about going from the naked math of no story to today weve got a story	1.0
	We just use all that same vocabulary but we try to put it in context with profits and in this case time in years	1.0
	Any questions about doing that	2.0
	Then were going to skip number two and Id like you to go to page 56 in the journal	1.0
	Page 56	1.0
	Youre looking for the core concept	1.0
	Youre going to cross out the third option	1.0
	Were not going to do that	1.0
	Oh it is	1.0
Oh I see it	There you go	1.0
	Cross off that last one	1.0
	I want to show you the first one	1.0
	In your prompt youre given a point and a vertex and even if they dont tell you what type of form to choose if they give us the vertex lets know that we have to pick the vertex form to start with so if I know my vertex is 2 where do those go in here	8.0
H and K	They go in for H and K I simply take my 2 put it in for H notice I still copy that minus sign down and if this had been a 2 if that first number was 2 I would have put minus 2 or positive	5.0
	Then I added that 2 there	1.0
	That gets me started but they told me another point	1.0
	What do I do with that 046	8.0
	It turns out thats probably the case over here	1.0
	We could figure that out by knowing that line of symmetry and looking that up	1.0
	We could find it but does this vertex form half Yintercept as a plugin value	2.0
No	No	4.0
	What do I do with X and Y	8.0
Add it to X and Y	I plug it in the place of X and Y because how can I get A it says everything here is numbers except for the letter A	5.0
	So I do all my work find out what it is	1.0
	Then dont miss this step	1.0
	Dont stop there	1.0
	Make sure you rewrite the equation with that A value in there	1.0
Does it always have to be this where two equal  Yes	Well you get partial credit	1.0
	You entered the problem correctly	1.0
	You get full if you wrote the whole thing	1.0
	You want to make sure that youve got that	1.0
	All right	1.0
	If Im given 18K Im going to plug in K Im going to plug in H and Im going to plug in the X and plug in the Y	1.0
	Then I find A and I rewrite my equation	1.0
	All right person number three explain to your team whats given and whats the strategy to finding the model	8.0
	Person number three go	2.0
	Question	2.0
	Are you doing okay	2.0
Yes	Yes I hear you	1.0
	Especially on a Friday	1.0
	We always feel we would make it work if we knew we had Monday afternoon	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Harper do you guys have a question for me over there	2.0
Shoot	All right go and ahead and ask the question	2.0
No I got it now	You got it	5.0
	Okay	1.0
	Any other questions	2.0
No maam	All right option two	1.0
	Lets say weve been given a point only now we know the Xintercepts	1.0
	If we know the Xintercepts we should use the	8.0
Intercept form	All right theres a little tie there right	2.0
	Thats where were going to start	1.0
	Here we have it	1.0
	Theres our Xintercepts	1.0
	Theres another point	1.0
	It happens to be the vertex in this case but because we have intercepts were going to use this	1.0
	Jesse	2.0
On the test do we get like a paper thing that sets the equation or you know	No	1.0
We have to memorize them	Yes	1.0
How many are there	Well in this case theres really only two	1.0
	I dont know Id have to look at the likes toolkits you know	1.0
Five or six	The toolkits would tell us	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Eyes up front please	1.0
	Its one or two but where is it a bit comfortable	1.0
	The next intercept theyre all synonyms roots zeros Xintercepts all mean the same thing	1.0
P and Q are technically just the Xintercepts	Yes	1.0
	Thats why they say Xintercepts P and Q	1.0
When you write the equation on the test if you wrote that one	Thats right	1.0
	You enter the problem correctly	1.0
	Weve got roots Xintercept zeros	1.0
	Im just going to take those numbers the 4 and the six and drop them in there	1.0
	Notice I did keep the negative sign	1.0
	Then what do you think were going to do with X and y	8.0
Plug them in the equation	Plug them in for X and Y	5.0
	Now we have all numbers with the exception of the A	1.0
	We have to start solving	1.0
	One plus four is five one minus six 5	1.0
	Ive got a 25A divide both sides by 25	1.0
	A equals 1 and dont forget to write it back in	1.0
	Now what if this problem asked you to put your answer in standard form	8.0
	What would you have to do	8.0
You unfactor it	Yes you unfactor it multiply it out you got to distribute that	1.0
	Could I have started with the vertex form to solve	2.0
	I got a point and the vertex I got a point and a vertex right	1.0
	If I was given this I could have done this or this but in both cases I would have to multiply out and remember this is X minus H times XH Do not think that means its X2 plus H2	1.0
	Remember its these two times itself again youll have four terms combine the like terms so dont make that mistake	1.0
	All right	1.0
	So these are your two strategies for solving the problems on Page 57 you are only doing one through eight so you dont need to turn the page theres more problems on the back were not going to do the ones on the next page	1.0
	In your teams youre going to assume the same role you had yesterday conductor coach et cetera	1.0
	Make sure everybodys on the same page or same problem same time	1.0
	No hogs no logs go ahead conductors get it started	1.0
	Yes dont be long	1.0
I wont be long	Conductor whats everybody working on	2.0
	I want to make sure everybody gets on the same place	1.0
	Do not include the 0 at the end just when you first start	1.0
	Theres a certain comfort	1.0
	You might have it if you do solve and  you could show that	1.0
	Coaches the answers are up here if you need to check them	1.0
Can you plug in the Xintercept if the	No youd have to use a different point	1.0
	If youve already used it here you got to have something else	1.0
	Correct	1.0
What is this	Its a microphone for capturing students  like for examole if I understand this resource better	1.0
	If you asked me questions and I said here let me show you how to do it	1.0
	That wouldnt be very good to teach or talk	1.0
	Everybody came up with the same things	3.0
	Did you do the work	2.0
	Walk me through what youve got here	1.0
Weve plugged in the vertex here to the  then we plugged in the second	Theres the problem	1.0
Do you want to expand it	When you multiplied it out and you got te 4 that 4A and then 3 after it	1.0
	4As	1.0
Then divide	But why	9.0
	Why cant you not do that	9.0
Its part of the A right	Its part of the A and	8.0
	Keep at it this way	1.0
	If its 4X plus 3 why cant you say thats 7X	1.0
Because	Exactly	1.0
	Math term we would say theyre not like terms	1.0
	Youre taking Xs and think about the three as popsicle sticks	1.0
	You cant combine As and popsicle sticks because its not the same thing	1.0
	Then what we do is we use reverse PEMDAS to decide which we do first	1.0
	The reverse of that the last two is adding subtracting	1.0
	When Im solving for X I go backwards so I do the adding or subtracting at first then multiplication or division part	1.0
Okay thank you	Really important question	1.0
	How are you doing	2.0
	You getting ready answers	2.0
	You havent checked yet	1.0
	Youre just ignoring her and youre on your phone	1.0
	Do you feel like knobs	1.0
	Youre good	2.0
	So you guys are done	2.0
	Take a little mental break if you do need to go to bathroom or get a drink just inquire	1.0
	How is things over here	2.0
We are going to need	Thats all you have to do	1.0
	You check your answers	2.0
	You can go take a break out there	1.0
	Just dont cause a scene	1.0
	How are you guys	2.0
What were we asking what is what	He really does need to work	1.0
	What was not correct	8.0
	Theyre all correct cool	1.0
	you just going to catch up	1.0
	Youve got one more to catch up on	1.0
	Let me know when youre done	1.0
	Oh my goodness	1.0
	You got two more done	1.0
	They do look very similar	1.0
Whats the difference	This one has	1.0
Okay and	Im sure it somehow or another	1.0
Is there a camera in this one	No theres no camera but Im imagining that this could control the angle try and try and put up those swivels	1.0
	Hi there	1.0
	How are you feeling	2.0
Pretty good	Are you doing okay	2.0
Yes	Do you have  today	1.0
No	I noticed I havent seen a lot of homework getting done	1.0
I do much homework	What was your grade on the test	1.0
Which test	test	1.0
Got a 94	You did pretty good	1.0
Yes	Are you an A student	1.0
say I am	Go for As	1.0
	So if youre an A student you are bale to do A work in on a test	1.0
Yes I usually do homework  and I dont understand it or something then I do some homework to help me understand it  something that I understand	Okay as long as you know its different on the  grade for you	1.0
I might  like 5 or something and then I wont be	Correct because even if you got half the points	1.0
It still be 5	It would be yes	1.0
	Anything that you can do to add points to that is in your favor	1.0
	Let me know if you need any help	1.0
Yes thank you	Its good for you to learn that today	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen lets try to pick up the speed on this if at all possible we want to shoot for being done in about five minutes	1.0
Thats a 4	This is a 10	1.0
	That looks like a 4 not a Y	1.0
Thats a 4	Yes I would tend to think that was a 4 not a Y	5.0

For the whole like	For the four of you	1.0
	All right let me have your team quizes	1.0
	A team quiz means team voices	1.0
	Team voices mean I cant  what anybody in the room is saying when Im sitting up here and you cant tell what that team next to you and saying	1.0

	You should have some points that are exact that you are talking about	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Rate yourself on how well you could explain how to subtract using any of the three methods that we reviewed on Friday	2.0
	Seems like most people are feParkerng proficient	1.0
	If youre not showing me a three whose responsibility is it to get that help and that practice	1.0
	Most people are pointing back at themselves so make sure you get that help all right	2.0
	Before we start more I neglected to take hot lunch count so please raise your hand nice and high if you are eating hot lunch here at school today	1.0
	Three four seven eight nine thank you	1.0
	All right for slate today we are going to practice rounding	1.0
	So Im going to dictate remember dictating makes it easy explaining	1.0
	Dictate decimals and you round it to indicate a place	1.0
	You re five minutes late	1.0
	Oopsy there we go	1.0
	What is 37 rounded to the nearest one	8.0
	Flash	1.0
Four	Excellent	1.0

	What is 781 round it to the nearest tenth	8.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good if you said 78 youre right	1.0
	What did people do that said eight	8.0
	They wrote eight on their slate what did they do Stella	8.0
I was not listening	Okay we like that admission	1.0
	You rounded it to the nearest one rather than the tenths right	2.0
Yes	Okay so better be careful listeners	1.0
	This next page Im going to tell you the number and youre going to write it and then well check to make sure you have the right number before I tell you what to round it to okay	2.0
	So write 093	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Nicely done round it to the nearest tenth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good job everybody say that number with me	2.0
09	Like that do the next one	1.0
	Write 265	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good work	1.0

27	Like that write 0681	1.0
	Does anybody know where Banders slate is	1.0
	Its walked away from him	1.0
Theyre always doing that this time of year	I know those troubling slates	1.0
	I like how people are looking in their desks	1.0
Always hiding	Thank you	1.0
	All on your mind	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Great job	1.0
	Round this number to the nearest hundredth into hundredth	1.0
	You found it	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Great lets say that number	2.0
068	All right heres your next one	1.0
	Write 72894	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Good and Ill show you up here so you can check yours	1.0
	You notice theres no comma even though we said 2000 that was just to help you understand	1.0
	So 72894	1.0
This is thousandths	No thats ten thousandths	5.0
	Look in your planners and break it down into that place value that fourth place value if you dont bParkereve me	1.0
	Round it to the nearest thousandth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	To the nearest thousandth	1.0
	Great job lets say that number	2.0
7289	Heres your next one	1.0

	Flash	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	Im going to open the window so you can verify digits	1.0
	82938	1.0
	Do you see why it s ten thousandths	9.0
	Because you were in the thousandths and then ten thousandths	1.0
	What comes after ten thousandths	8.0
Hundred thousandths	Then youd get to millionths	1.0
	Okay does that make sense	2.0
Yes	Round this to the nearest thousandth	1.0
	Flash	1.0
	Great lets say it out loud	2.0
8294	I want you to explain to your shoulder partners how you rounded this	8.0
	Its partner A s turn to explain that so partner A explain it to your shoulder partner	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Heres your last one	1.0
	Write 6994	1.0
	Flash	1.0

	Person four start a conversation	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Great now flash me your answer please	1.0
	Yes now I have to form digit seven	1.0
	I understand why it s seven I need to talk about this	1.0
	Im not quite clear why its seven	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets look at our learning intention please	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Read this with me please	2.0
I will use previously learned strategies to add and subtract decimals to balance a bank statement	What does the word previously mean	8.0
	Partner B you tell your shoulder partner what does previously means	8.0
	Back to me please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Parker what does previously mean	8.0
My partner says its something that its already been done its something that already has happened to me	Im seeing a lot of people agreeing with the thumbs up thank you	1.0
	So weve been practicing adding and subtracting decimals all week last week	1.0
	The new word is balance balance a bank statement	1.0
	I m going to show you thats why here	1.0
	This is an example of a balance sheet	1.0
	When you have an account youre keeping track of the money in and out of that account	1.0
	Later in this year in March we ll be going to Amara Town and youll have a checking account	1.0
	Many of you see your parents use a debit card to buy things at the store	1.0
	That debit card is immediately taking money out of their account and your parents can look online at their account balance and see when money comes into their account	1.0
	Like they get their paycheck it probably goes directly into their account and then when they buy things and they swipe their card the money automatically comes out of their account so you can see what your balance is with all those transactions	1.0
	Because you re taking money in and out of your account you need to know how much you actually have	1.0
	I understand what balance means Im not sure	1.0
	Were not talking about balance like in PE where you re balancing on the balanced beam right	2.0
Yes	Talk with your face partner	2.0
	Partner A gets to go first	2.0
	What does balance mean	8.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	All right lets hear what balance means in your words or your partner s words	1.0
	Major	2.0
Balance means what you have of the total of if you re spending something or losing something or gaining something and whats the total you have right now at that moment	Nicely done	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	It s really important at Amara Town that you keep track of your balance	1.0
	Were going to teach you how to record it and keep track of it because they wont give you this handydandy app on your phone but look at your balance so well be practicing that later this year but this is definitely practice towards that today	1.0
	Let s look at our success criteria	1.0
	Read that with me	2.0
	please	1.0
I will know I am successful when I can explain what strategy was most efficient to add and subtract decimals	Youll be playing a game where youre keeping track of your balance	1.0
	How appropriate	1.0
	Its that time of year where we are doing lots of shopping right	2.0
So youll lose a ton of money	Or you spend	1.0
	Youre not losing it youre spending it	1.0
	Thats different than losing it	1.0
	When you buy something you get it	1.0
When I was little when you spend something	Thats your perception back when you were a kid	1.0
Yes	Funny	1.0
	All right heres our math message	1.0
	Math message	1.0
	Solve the number story explain your strategy to a partner	1.0
	One you had 146 in your piggy bank	1.0
	You found 17 cents between the couch cushions how much money do you have now	1.0
	When your partners are done go ahead and talk with your partners	1.0
	Okay lets try another one	1.0
	Math message two	1.0
	You bought a vegetable tray for 1219	1.0
	You paid with a 20 how much change did you get	1.0
	Ive been walking around the room I saw a lot of people use either it looked like US traditional or trade first	1.0
	I didnt see anybody shading on the old grids that weve been using	1.0
	Why didnt we use that method	9.0
	Why didnt we use that Bander	9.0
Because its not efficient	Yes its not very efficient	5.0
	You dont see people just carrying around a lot of little graph papers	1.0
	Move on Ill be right with you	1.0
	Darnell used counting up	1.0
	Yay	1.0
	Can you model that for us	8.0
Where do I set	Wherever you want	1.0
Okay do I just put this under the thing	Wherever you want to show us at the same time	1.0
	Me counting up is a mental strategy but I think it would be helpful for people to see it	1.0
Can I show it on the board maybe	Sure wherever you want	1.0
	I like the way people turned to look at the Ms Carter	1.0
You start with the smaller ones so 1219 and then I did plus 100 and that will get you to	Do you mind if I have you to switch coloring material writing material so that people on the cheap seats in the back can see	1.0
	Thank you I dont know why this thing isnt turning	1.0
This and that and so 100807 would be bring the one down eight and seven and you add the decimal point back in so thatll be 781 I think	Would you have to write all this out	2.0
No	Like when I did this with Amber and Emma we did it mentally	1.0
	We just said okay if get from 19 to 20 it would be one cent	1.0
	From 20 cents to what would get us to the nearest dollar and we got 80 cents so we knew we had 81	1.0
	Then we knew we were at 13 so to get from 13 to 20 was 7	1.0
	We did all mentally but I loved that you showed how that worked	1.0
	Mental strategies can be used	1.0
Should I erase it	No leave it	1.0
	People can I dont know just glance at it I guess	1.0
	Why do strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money	9.0
	Youre going to talk with your face partner	2.0
	Partner A gets to go first	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	2.0
	All right everybody thats in the room	1.0
	Gabriel let me go back to my original question sorry why do the strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money	9.0
Because it shows	Liola	2.0
They just represent because theyre cents	Lots of people agreeing	1.0
	You want to add to that please	2.0
I agree with Liola but also decimal place its actually the same thing because if you have 7325 in money it practically would be the same just not with a thousand	Parker	2.0
	Sorry I didnt realize you said Bander sorry	1.0
I agree and I would also like to add on because when you write because when you say money you say 781 cents because of the decimal	Nice	1.0
	Parker	2.0
It depends on what it is  the cents and the whole number would be the dollars	Kimberly	2.0
Theyre still a hundred	What does the 20 in a penny represent	8.0
	What does a penny represent	8.0
	A person thats out of the room	1.0
	Amber	2.0
One cent	One cent represents what though	8.0
	How many of them does it take to make a dollar	8.0
A hundred	Yes and what place value is that in decimals	8.0
Hundredths	Hundredths right	2.0
	Because it takes a hundred pennies	1.0
	What about dimes what do they represent in this in the money system	8.0
	Bander	2.0
A tenth	A tenth how many does it take to make a dollar	8.0
	10 and then I had a voice saying we dont do ounces with our money system so thats not necessary all right	2.0
	Today were going to play a game rather than do journal pages	1.0
	Youre going to go to the games	1.0
	Youre going to make sure that youre playing with a partner so change it from single to partners and youre playing	1.0
	I was going to say guest	1.0
	Can you guys read that	2.0
Yes	Do you want to come on the front to do it or can you see from here	1.0
We can see from here	The skill of practicing is what	8.0
	Read it with me	2.0
Adding and subtracting decimals in the form of money	Lets read what the description is that were doing	2.0
The player with the most money left at the end of eight rounds wins the game	See here where player one will be keeping track of their money	1.0
	Player two will keep track here	1.0
	This looks like a little calculator for us to keep using	1.0
	Lets try this out	1.0
	Im pink what color are you	1.0
Blue	Red is my second place color	1.0
	Are you ready to spend and save	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	Player one click the coin to toss it	1.0
	Click the number generator to get a money amount	1.0
	What number generator is this	8.0
	Based on the coin toss add or subtract the money amount to find your balance	1.0
	Enter your answer then click okay	1.0
	Im going to do counting up so I know to get from 87 cents to 90 cents would be three cents so than that would be 590	1.0
	Then I know a tenth would get me to the next whole number so 13 cents would get me to 6 and to get to a hundred from 6 would be 94	1.0
	No	1.0
	Yes 94 so Im going to say 94 and I think I said 13	1.0
	Right thats your new balance	1.0
	Player two click the coin to toss it	1.0
	You can use whatever strategy you want okay	2.0
	Click the number generator to get a money amount	1.0
	Based on the coin toss add or subtract the money amount to find your balance	1.0
	Do it on your slate then tell me	1.0
	Enter your answer then click okay	1.0
	When you see an addition sign that means youre adding to your account	1.0
	Sometimes you get gifts in the form of cheques or a paycheque	1.0
	Okay flash	1.0
	Youre going to say that number for me	2.0
10515	Ive heard somebody say this One hundred and five dollars and fifteen cents does that sound right	3.0
No	Talk with your face partner	2.0
	What would be wrong with the way they said that	3.0
	Sebastian G what did that person do	3.0
They put and right when they said one hundred and five because they were thinking like zero before and	Yes so were kind of have some habits sometimes of saying things	1.0
	Were trying to get out of that habit because we know and means decimal	1.0
	So one hundred five and fifteen cents is what I saw a lot of people answer	1.0
	Ready to go	1.0
	Right thats your new balance	1.0
	Get the hang of this	1.0
	I need to keep practicing with you	1.0
	All right fabulous	1.0
	Youre going to play with your face partner	1.0
	Joseph you and Skyler are face partners for this	1.0
	Quinn why dont you play with Parker and you guys trio up	1.0
	All right ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Do you guys need this up	1.0
	You two will be together	1.0
	Which two will be together	1.0
Me and	Gabriel	1.0
	What word could we use instead of less that we are	8.0
Subtracting	Subtraction	5.0
Im confused if Im subtracting	That doesnt make sense right	2.0
I cant minus zero from here	We keep saying about minus	5.0
Then you get ten right there	Do you remember when you guys were like in Kindergarten and you did calendar math	2.0
	They would gather the little popsicle sticks	1.0
Yes	I think this is six	1.0
	No its five six seven eight nine and then Ill get 10	1.0
	Now we have 10	1.0
	Then we rubber band these together to make a group of 10	1.0
	Do you remember that	2.0
	When youre borrowing and trading or regrouping	1.0
	These all mean the same thing	1.0
	Youre taking this group of ten and moving it over to one place value	1.0
	You didnt like Brody said you over here there was nothing to borrow	1.0
	You have to change this 100	1.0
Oh right	Does that make sense	2.0
So thats a zero	There you go	1.0
	Coach your partner	3.0
	Coach your partner	3.0
	youre working with	1.0
I need to do some mental math	Okay time out please	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Looking for a couple of more pairs of eyes	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Right now for the next 15 minutes	1.0
	This is your assignment	1.0
	Youre going to finish that math box work	1.0
	Some of you are finished	1.0
	That doesnt pertain to you	1.0
	You just keep moving down this list	1.0
	Page 115	1.0
	Thats practicing finding area that have fractional linked sides	1.0
	When you finish that you can play this game	1.0
	You can either do it independently or with another person that is also finished	1.0
	Questions about what to do here	2.0

	Some of those math  to get a very tough you know how math boxes give you page number	1.0
	Here to look at some examples	1.0
	You might want to go back on the lines  and look at those journal pages and get those grades up	1.0
Can I do my math	No right now here in class	1.0
	I need to get this done	1.0
	Its keeping me and getting my work covered	1.0
	Whichever way  Im coming you want me to  Do you have the real  Such as	1.0
Yes	the problem	1.0
Do you need help	Yes	1.0
Okay I get it	You were doing that so its fine already	1.0
	Its fine your way thats fascinating	1.0
	Cool that was awesome	1.0
	Nice job guys	1.0
	Youre on oneminute warning	1.0
	My friends are not back at their desks if you can please get there	1.0
	The math  that we did for our warmup this morning you can either give it to somebody for extra practise if they want it or you can recycle it	1.0
	Thats a copy of the homework I just put in the center of your table	1.0
	Please put your name on it	1.0
	Except for the assignment we did for our warmup give it to somebody for extra practice if they need it or you can recycle it	1.0
	Rotate to this home link that says 414	1.0
	Read the directions at the top with me	2.0
Show your work on the back of this paper	So are you going to write an answer into the number model	2.0
	No	1.0
	Youre are supposed to write a letter for the unknown	1.0
	Should you put a unit with your answer	2.0
Yes	Questions about what to do at the top	2.0
	And down below is except you practicing some division	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Lets put some closure on what we did today	1.0
	what was an effective strategy for adding and subtracting amounts of money for you	8.0
	What were the effective strategies	8.0
	Not with your shoulder partner about that partner	2.0
	B goes first	2.0
	Ready go	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Your success criteria you will know you are successful when you can explain what strategy was most efficient to add and subtract decimals	1.0
	Go Quinn	8.0
	Can you please answer	8.0
With US traditional we like  to figure it out	Brody why are you using that	9.0
I think kind of because with some people its not efficient for some people because  some people do it and you still end up with a trouble process to do	Good point if you dont understand the strategy then it can be a more timeconsuming one	1.0
	Can we agree that whats efficient for you might not be efficient for somebody else potentially	3.0
	I know when I was a kid my mom shed always say when we were playing Monopoly Here count up to make change I never understood	1.0
	She never demonstrated it to me	1.0
	She would just do it so I never understood it until I was a Ms Carter and I had to make sure people knew how to do it and I could show them	1.0
	How are you with the success criteria for todays math lesson	2.0
	if you could teach it to somebody else it means you know what youre doing or tutor me	1.0
	So Im getting better	1.0
	Im not quite where I need to be	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	You going to put your homework away	1.0
	Make sure that	1.0
	Make sure you have your Chromebook at your desk before you join us for	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
Why is that thing videotaping me	Its videotaping me	1.0
I thought you said itll go around like on the carpet	No it just goes like this	1.0
	It just swivels like this	1.0
I dont see it doing that	Its probably because Im mostly standing over here	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen when I say high five what I mean is youre turning youre looking and youre putting one hand up and I can see your eyes	1.0
	We are back at zero places Okay	2.0
	Thank you hands down	1.0
	Ms Miller told me that you started this lesson on angles yesterday so tell me about We always name our angles with a letter at the vertex so we will call this angle A and we will call this angle B	1.0
	Want you to think back to yesterday what did you discover about angle A and angle B	8.0
	Ill have you think for a minute	1.0
	What could you tell me about angle A and angle B okay	8.0
	I want you to look at your face partner at your group	1.0
	Say good morning	2.0
Good morning	Do you have one over here excellent	1.0
	How about that	1.0
	With your current face partner	1.0
	Please talk about what did you discover about angle A and angle B go	8.0
	Does that mean angle A is smaller	2.0
	Its so good were reviewing this isnt it	2.0
I want to revise my thinking	Excellent	1.0
	What do you want to revise your thinking about	8.0
Right now I just feel like the lines	Okay all right	1.0
	All right my friends high five	1.0
	I love how three groups remembered	1.0
	Lets try it again	1.0
	Ready	1.0
	High five	1.0
	Thank you friends	1.0
	Eyes back up here	1.0
	I heard some great conversations but I also heard some great questions	1.0
	When I draw your stick would you share something you just talked about with your partner and well see if we can clarify our thinking	1.0
	Were talking about what did we discover about angle A and angle B okay	2.0
	Whos lucky number 25	2.0
	All right	1.0
	Can you remind me your name	2.0
Brady	Brady I knew that	1.0
	Will you stand up and tell us something you heard with you and your partner	1.0
My partner said that she thinks that theyre both the same	Tell me what you mean by the same	8.0
Theyre both pointed at the same The degree of that	The degree	4.0
	Im hearing you say theyre the same in degrees okay	1.0
	Thank you for sharing Brady	1.0
	All right well hear from a couple more	1.0
	My friends I want you to come back to our sentence starters up here with I agree I disagree	3.0
	Think about what Brady just said	1.0
	Whos lucky number 22	1.0
Thats me	Fern would you tell us think about what Brady just said and you may add on	3.0
It kind of depends on	Okay do you guys hear what Ferns saying	2.0
	It depends	4.0
	Ms Miller asked you a question yesterday which angle is bigger so it depends what she means by that	1.0
	Tell us more about that Fern	8.0
	You can go point to it	1.0
The size is bigger but not the angle	The size of what is bigger	8.0
	We would call that a Do we know the math vocabulary for that	8.0
Ray	Ray	4.0
	Heres the vertex	1.0
	Im hearing Fern say the rays are bigger in angle B	1.0
	The rays are smaller in angle A but what about the angle measurement	8.0
Theyre the same	How do you know	9.0
I put angle A and angle B and they were the same	They were the same	4.0
	Lets have one more	1.0
	Damian would you add on to that	3.0
	Would you share something that	2.0
I agree with	Do you mind standing up so we can really hear you	2.0
	Thank you honey	1.0
	Tell your class	2.0
What Im hearing you say is when we talk about angles being bigger and smaller were not talking about the length of the ray	What were talking about is the measurement where the Did you name this yesterday	2.0
	You guys know what this little arrows called	8.0
Vertex	Its called an arc okay	2.0
	So you look at where the arc is and thats where you measure the size of the angle later	1.0
	You measure the size of the angle by the arc	1.0
	Ms Miller they have some amazing conversations about the size of the angle	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Would you like to add on	3.0
We were supposed to write what we want like if we disagree or agree with her	Do you think angle B is bigger	2.0
Well I said I agree because the size of B is bigger but I disagree because the angle is the same size and the same type of angle	You guys have some really great thinking about that	1.0
	Do you want to add one more thing Michael	3.0
Yes so at first I agreed with Fern and Brady and Damian said but now Im  because now I remember that the arrows meaning it goes on forever	When were talking about angles what we really want to pay attention to is the arc the measurement of whats inside the angle	1.0
	Though the rays might be really long or really short when were talking about the size of an angle thats not what were paying attention to	1.0
	Add on to it Colin	3.0
It makes it a ray	Go point to it	1.0
	Yes so everybody knows what youre talking about honey	1.0
	Yes	1.0
The arrow right here usually goes out throughout and it doesnt stop	Thank you for clarifying that	1.0
Its on both sides so technically theyre the same length	Probably well youre right	1.0
If B stayed and then A grew it would be the same size as B	Yes	1.0
	They sure did	1.0
	My friends lets look at the bottom	1.0
	Im going to come back to that Colin	1.0
	I would like for us to look at this bottom part of our math message	1.0
	Can you turn yours over so I can see what youre looking at right now	1.0
	Thank you Brendan	1.0
	So this bottom part of our math message its asking us to look at wedges	1.0
	Were going to talk about what a wedge is	1.0
	It just means a piece	1.0
	Were going to use our faction circle pieces	1.0
	Ms Miller where do we keep those in here	1.0
	Okay ladies and gentlemen would you please take out your light green fraction circles	1.0
How many of them	Well I dont know because you need to figure out this is the question	1.0
	What does it say	1.0
	Okay lets start Instead of green my friends I think youll need green later	1.0
	Lets start with purple right now	1.0
	Purple wedges	1.0
Light purple or dark	Okay	1.0
	Lets try it	1.0
	Try them	1.0
	How many whole wedges fit into the angle	8.0
	Try it out lets see what we find	1.0
	Joshwell do you have your fraction circles	1.0
No theres	Why not	1.0
	Can you look for me please	1.0
	Or if you dont have it what would be an option for you of where to look or what to do	1.0
Probably at the back desk	Does Ms Miller have extras	1.0
	I dont have extras but we have some friends that are absent	1.0
	Im just thinking he needs to be responsible for what he could do right now to participate with everyone else	1.0
	I did have a friend that was like going to share it with somebody next to them that would be a good idea	1.0
	That would be a great strategy wouldnt it	1.0
How else does a cube look	We dont know	1.0
	Try them out	1.0
Ill go with the light purple	Try it out	1.0
Its light purple	Ms Travers she said what if its not an even amount	8.0
	I think on the first one it wants to know how many whole wedges would fit into the angle	1.0
	Do you think that they mean maybe not necessarily a certain color	2.0
	Do you think they mean like it doesnt have to be purple it could be is there another color thats a whole	2.0
I think both wedges are	What I think we are looking at right now is try out some different wedges and lets see how many whole wedges can fit into this angle	1.0
	This angle is called angle CDE	1.0
	I want you to try to fit some wedges into the angle and have it fit perfectly	1.0
Cant this angle also be called EDC	It could be	1.0
	It could be	1.0
I have two of them	Try it	1.0
	try it out a different way	1.0
	Yes now you can probably use that  to help you with the next one	1.0
Okay now I have three	The kids are	1.0
	Why arent all of our measurements the same	9.0
	They used different size wedges	1.0
	Do other wedges create  measurement	2.0
I have four	What do you think that one does	8.0
	You can measure amount of rotation by measuring the spread of the angle	1.0
	Theres lots of	1.0
	Later one way we will measure is	1.0
	No its whatever quarters fit on here so you have to figure out what fits four on here	1.0
	Fourth graders my friends Im looking for what wedges are being used to fill the angle and Im actually going to have you stand up push in your chair and stand up behind your chair	1.0
	Everybody stand up	1.0
	Everybody push in their chair	1.0
	What Im looking for right now is youre going to do another gallery walk and in our gallery walk were going to go around and look at what fraction circles or what wedges did our classmates try when they were measuring this angle with wedges	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	So should you touch anyone elses work when you walk by	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Should you look at other peoples work when you walk by	2.0
Yes	Right where Ms Miller is standing everybody point to the front whiteboard	1.0
	I want you to think while youre walking around do you agree do you disagree did you think something similar to this partner this classmate did you use a similar strategy a different strategy	3.0
	Ready	2.0
	You have a 30second walk Im going to ring the bell	1.0
	When the bell rings rather when it stops head back to your seat	1.0
	Please head back to your seat	1.0
	Now please come to the carpet facing the screen	1.0
	Sorry David	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	Theyve accepted it	1.0
	Kind of	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming to the carpet so quietly and showing us that youre ready	1.0
	Id like you to take a look here at this mathematical representation how many wedges fit into this angle	8.0
	Please show me with your fingers	1.0
	How many blue wedges fit	8.0
	Two okay	1.0
	Youre just listening right now okay	2.0
	How many wedges fit into this angle	8.0
	Show me with your fingers	1.0
	I dont see everyones hands I need to see a couple more	1.0
	Whats our answer now	8.0
Three	Okay	1.0
	All right	1.0
	How many wedges fit into this angle	8.0
	My question for you right now is which one is right	8.0
	High five someone next to you so you have a thinking partner	1.0
	Show me who youre talking to	1.0
	Would you please sit up straight Brady and I want you to think about what the three we just showed is there one thats right	2.0
	Talk to your partner	2.0
	Go	2.0
	Well it took me a minute too	1.0
	Okay close your conversations please	1.0
	Thank you for your smart thinking	1.0
	Would you keep your hand up if youre willing to share your thinking right now	1.0
	Brendan	2.0
I think they all are because I tried all of those too when I was trying to figure out how many would fit on the second one but then I realized when we came to the carpet that all of these could be whole wedges so I figured that the orange one was one whole because at first I thought just the whole circle like the red one would be the whole because I thought that on the second one it would be four so I thought it would be the yellow one but then I saw Alyssas when she put 13 on hers and then I revised my thinking and thinking that that was one whole because it fit perfectly on there	Thank you for explaining why you revised your thinking and how your thinking keeps changing because thats a good thing in math	1.0
	Colin would you like to add on	3.0
I was thinking	Its Jack	2.0
No Colin	Colin	4.0
	Okay	1.0
	All right tell us your thinking	9.0
	Tell your classmates	2.0
Yes you can	My friends what I want us to think about is we start	1.0
Okay but you cant do all of them	I just love how your brains are thinking so much about this	1.0
I respectfully disagree	My friends its not okay to just shout out because thats not respectfully communicating with your partners	1.0
	Heres what I want you to know youre all right	1.0
	This was one way of being right this is another way of being right	1.0
	Lets look at this on right now	1.0
Excuse me	Just a minute please honey	1.0
	How much of the fourth wedge	8.0
	I think were supposed to have the light purple	1.0
I think light purple is	Do they mean this one	1.0
No I think they mean light purple	About how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle	8.0
Yes you can fit 412	We could fit 412	5.0
I think thats what the fourth wedge	How did you know we could fit 412	9.0
	Who said that	2.0
	Yes Alyssa	2.0
Before I counted out I knew that four times three equals 12 but so then I counted out and it worked out	You know what I think	2.0
	Tell us more	1.0
	Heres what I think its really asking when it comes down to it	1.0
	What does it mean to measure an angle	8.0
	When we measure something we need to use a standard unit	1.0
	That means we have to use something like an inch a centimeter a mile a kilometer or a wedge a colored wedge	1.0
	When we measure something we need to use a standard unit so when were talking about measuring an angle what were really talking about is measuring the distance between this ray and this ray	1.0
	Now we could go on a walk raise your hand if you go on walks with your family	1.0
	I might go for a walk and I might measure my walk in steps	1.0
	I might say Yes I got 10000 steps today	1.0
	Ms Miller might go on the same walk and she might say Well I got two miles	1.0
	Paris might go on the same walk and she said	1.0
	Well I got 28 kilometers	1.0
	Who would be right	8.0
All of them	All of us	5.0
Well actually we dont know	Why	9.0
You have different sized feet	Because the unit of measurement I used was different than the unit of measurement Ms Miller used was different than the unit of measurement that Paris used	1.0
	What were talking about is we all walked the same distance	1.0
	Lets say Paris walked from C to ETwalked from C to E and Ms Miller walked from C to E	1.0
unit so youll get different answers because you guys have different sized feet	Yes why did we get different answers	9.0
Because you used feet she used miles and Paris used kilometers	Exactly okay	1.0
	We all walked the same distance	1.0
	Paris and Ms Miller and I we all walked the same distance but I used steps Paris used kilometers and Ms Miller measured hers in miles	1.0
	We all walked the same distance but it was measured in a different way	1.0
	Thats the same thing with this angle	1.0
	You were each measuring it with a different fraction piece or wedge but the angle is the same distance	1.0
	The angle is the same measurement we were just using different pieces	1.0
	Does anyone have any questions or comments about this	2.0
	Yes my dear	2.0
Are we supposed to	We are	1.0
I dont agree because I measured them	You know a way to measure angles	2.0
Yes	Does anyone else	2.0
	Brendan whos over there with you because I cant see your handsome faces	1.0
	Cayden and Damian when Im teaching I need to see your handsome faces	1.0
	You know a way to measure angles	2.0
Yes	Tell us more	8.0
Okay I usually use a box and a circle to tell  because equals are very similar to fraction pieces because they can do the outline	They sure are theyre similar to fraction pieces	1.0
I was thinking it might be a fortyfive degree angle	Youre starting to think about degrees of angles and that you know that different fraction pieces are different measures	2.0
Yes	Were going to get back to that thats smart thinking	1.0
	I want to tell you another way to measure angles	1.0
	My friends another way to measure angles is with the tool called the protractor	1.0
	Youre going to get to that in a couple of days but the way were going to talk about measuring angles today is with rotations	1.0
	Everybody say rotation	2.0
Rotation	Im going to give you a challenge right now	1.0
	You are going to need to go collect all your fraction pieces and put them back in the baggie	1.0
	Im going to have you keep this paper on your desk but we dont need it any more right now	1.0
	Heres what I need your desk clean and clear except for this paper	1.0
	Your fraction circle pieces are going to be back in the baggie and you are going to stand behind your desk like a pencil like this when youre ready and go	1.0
	Can you show me help me please while I get these papers back with their owners	1.0
	I borrowed yours	1.0
	Damian I borrowed yours and	1.0
	Will you keep that idea oftheres 360 degrees in a circle right now in your brain and be ready to share that in a minute	2.0
	Ladies and gentlemen thank you for showing me your pencil and that youre ready	1.0
	Pencil standing straight up and tall	1.0
	I love how Mark is ready	1.0
	I love how Michael is ready	1.0
	Im waiting for a couple of friends back here to show me that they are ready	1.0
	I would like nothing in your hands	1.0
	I would like you to face me and I would like you to face it so that you can see the screen right here	1.0
	Ms Miller you are doing an excellent job	1.0
	My friends today we will explore the word of say it	2.0
Rotation	Were going to use rotation the word rotation to help us with measuring angles and were going to use this word iteration of measurement units and angle measures	1.0
	That means were going to keep trying different ways to use rotation to measure angles	1.0
	We will know that we have it when we practice different kinds of turns because turn is another word for what	8.0
Rotation	Youre going to be doing what	8.0
Turn	And	8.0
Rotations	Were going to be using those to measure benchmark angles	1.0
	Now heres what I mean by benchmark	1.0
	Benchmark means angles that we use a lot	1.0
	How many degrees Colin this is where I need you how many degrees are in a circle	8.0
360	360	4.0
	Are you facing me right now	2.0
Yes	We are going to turn clockwise	1.0
	Ready put your right hand up	1.0
	We are going to be turning clockwise were going to rotate 360 degrees or a full circle ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	She didnt say two circles	1.0
	That was one circle	1.0
	She said one	1.0
	We rotated a full turn	1.0
	Hands down	1.0
	Left hand up	1.0
	We are going to rotate one full turn counterclockwise	1.0
	That means the opposite way of the clock	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Now if I was measuring that angle that was a full turn angle or Colin how many degrees	8.0
360	360	4.0
	Face back upfront again	1.0
	We are turning clockwise which hand goes up	8.0
Right	Right	4.0
	This time we are turning onehalf turn right	2.0
	We are turning onehalf turn and we will be facing the back wall when were done	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Half turn	1.0
	Lets see if I can stump you here	1.0
	Hand down	1.0
	Hold up your left hand	1.0
	Were going to turn left which is counterclockwise another half turn	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
Oh my God its so hard	Where should you be facing	8.0
The front	Excellent	1.0
	My friends so far we have turned a whole turn we have turned a halfturn and now we are going to turn a	8.0
Quarter	Quarter	4.0
	How did you guess	9.0
Because a quarter is half of	Who said that	2.0
	A quarter Eva was that you	2.0
Yes	Say it again	2.0
A quarter is half of a half	A quarter is half of the half	5.0
90 degrees	Ready	2.0
	Or	2.0
90 degrees	Because 90 is 14 of 360	5.0
	Youre just brilliant youre blowing my mind	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Face forward	1.0
	Right hand	1.0
	Were turning clockwise onequarter of a turn	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	Keep your right hand up	1.0
	Turn another onequarter of a turn	1.0
	Keep your right hand up were turning clockwise another one quarter and another one quarter clockwise	1.0
	Where should you be facing	8.0
The whiteboard	Okay	1.0
	Left hand up	1.0
	Please turn onequarter of a turn counterclockwise	1.0
	Another quarter	1.0
	Another quarter and another quarter counterclockwise and were facing	8.0
The whiteboard	Great	1.0
	How many quarters were in a full turn	8.0
	How many quarter turns were in a full turn	8.0
Four	Four okay	2.0
	All right	1.0
	My friends have a seat	1.0
Finally	Good thinking good practicing	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen would you please open up your math journal to page 178	1.0
	178	1.0
	Okay my friends	1.0
	When we look at page 178 we are going to be talking about measuring angles with turns with rotations okay	2.0
	Im going to do a couple with you you are going to do a couple with your thinking partner	1.0
	If I can find a pencil on Ms Millers desk	1.0
	Heres one right here	1.0
	Woah I just lost the lead down there for you	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	Its okay thats fine	1.0
	Okay my friends	1.0
	This is my other favorite thing to show me youre ready	1.0
	Hold your pencil between two fingers like this and do it a little wiggle	1.0
	Show me a good wiggle	1.0
	Show me youre ready with a good wiggle	1.0
	Okay pencil in your hand	1.0
	Point your eraser to the word describe	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	I want to hear all of your voices	1.0
	Go	2.0
Use the words full turn threequarters turn halfturn and quarterturn	Describe each angle by the amount of rotations	4.0
	Use the words full turn 34 turn half turn and quarter turn	4.0
	My friends these are your answers	1.0
	Number one the amount of the rotation	1.0
	So were talking about from here the amount of rotation	1.0
	Would you please whisper what you think the answer is to your face partner	8.0
	Go	2.0
Half turn	Okay three two one	1.0
	Say it out loud	8.0
Quarter	I love when I hear two different answers	1.0
	This is a teachers dream	1.0
	Okay high five	1.0
	I heard two answers	1.0
	I heard quarterturn I heard halfturn	1.0
	May I have a volunteer defend your thinking for one of those answers	1.0
	Quarter turn or half turn	1.0
	Brady	2.0
	Nice love	1.0
	Would you stand up for us so we can hear you	2.0
I thought it was a quarter turn based on the rotation of how far the angle was and the reason why I think it is a quarter turn is because if you look it looks like its not a full half turn based on how long it is	Thank you Brady	1.0
	Would you call on someone else	2.0
	My friends remember our sentence starters on the whiteboard	1.0
I think its a halfturn because if you look at the shape of it if you do that shape again I think its a whole square and I think that would be a whole	Alyssa would you please call on another person	2.0
	Were going to keep hearing from each other	1.0
I think its a quarter turn because it mostly depends on the turn like how much you have to turn	Okay	1.0
	Everybody stand up	1.0
	Face the front board	1.0
	Were actually going to do were starting here and were going to turn to where this ray is pointing	1.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	What did we just do	8.0
Quarter turn	There we go	1.0
	Write it down	1.0
	Our answer for number one is what	8.0
Quarter turn	Quarter turn	4.0
	Lets do number two together	1.0
	This is an interesting one	1.0
	What do we think about look at the arc and whisper to your face partner again	8.0
	Full turn quarter turn half turn threequarters turn	1.0
	Whisper to your face partner again	8.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay	1.0
	Say your answer out loud	8.0
Full turn	Is there a volunteer to explain their thinking	9.0
	Who havent I heard from in a while	2.0
	Bryce	2.0
I said it was a whole turn because if you look at the very bottom of it it shows a whole circle	What did that tell you	8.0
It told me that it was rotating all the way around	Thank you for sharing Bryce	1.0
	Vincent you would rotate it all the way around	1.0
	Could everybody turn and look at Bryce	1.0
	Will you show us by actually turning your body	2.0
	Ready	2.0
	Go	1.0
	He did a full turn	1.0
Its like that earth thing you were doing isnt it	Thats right	1.0
	Heres your job	1.0
	Stand up find your thinking partner	1.0
	Same thinking partner	1.0
	Same thinking partner as before	1.0
	You and your thinking partner are going to solve numbers three four five and six	1.0
	Freeze please	1.0
	Will you show me a quick frozen	2.0
	When youre with your thinking partner youre going to talk through numbers three four five and six	1.0
	When you are done go back to your seat because thats Ms Hilgreth Hildriths clue that everybody is done ready to check	1.0
	Okay	1.0
the ones that we	You are going to find your thinking partner that you are matched up with on the front whiteboard and do numbers three four five and six	1.0
	Go	1.0
Because if this was ones the quarter and it went like that	Im going to come back later and get	1.0
	Im going to come back later and get these All my stuff	1.0
	Because I have Masterson next I dont want to be too late	1.0
	Okay we should be good	1.0
	We have it seems forgotten where place value is	1.0
	I look around I see a whole bunch of people who have this answer which is incorrect	1.0
	So let s do a little review of place value	1.0
	I know that my chart is covered but to be honest with you place value Bryson is something that you guys especially for the whole numbers should be experts at and have memorized	1.0
	Then by now in fifth grade you should have this memorized too	1.0
	Because  we can t use those place value charts	1.0
	Josiah please cap your marker	1.0
	I don t want to see you wasting the ink again	1.0
	Mr Evan would you mind handing me my book and my cards that are right there	1.0
	Here is my decimal	1.0
	Turn to someone close to you	1.0
	What is the place to the left of the decimal	8.0
	Tell them	8.0
	It s not a whole number	1.0
	It has a place value	1.0
	It has a place	1.0
	It is a whole number but it has a place	1.0
	Okay what is to the left Lennox	8.0
	What place is this	8.0
The ones	Okay	1.0
	Then Ellie what s this one	8.0
Tenth	Not tenths	5.0
	There s a huge difference there friends	1.0
	You have to both listen and write it in order to get the right Phoenix what s here	8.0
	sorry	1.0
	Lea is also	1.0
	what s here	8.0
The tenths place	Notice the THS	1.0
	Tell your partner what does the THS signal when you hear it	8.0
	What does it signal	8.0
	Tell your partner please	8.0
	and a pencil	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	Actually leave the pencil	1.0
	Nate what does the THS signal	8.0
at the right of the decimal	Exactly	1.0
	That means it is a place value to the right of the decimal	5.0
	It is a place value that is smaller than one	1.0
	Smaller than a whole	1.0
	Class what comes next after tenths	8.0
Hundredths	Again it s got that THS	1.0
	I said we have a nine in the tenths place	1.0
	Take a look at this	1.0
	Does this have a nine in the tenths place	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	My friends who said no please refer to the place value chart that I just wrote	1.0
	The tenth is to the right of the decimal	1.0
	One place value to the right there is a nine so that one is correct	1.0
	Then I said there is a seven in the ones place	1.0
	Is there a seven in the ones place	2.0
No	Where is the seven	8.0
In the hundredths	In the hundredths place	5.0
	One strategy I did notice Bryson did this strategy some of others of you might have but I noticed very few people is to put these spots in	1.0
	Then you said okay there is a nine in the tenths place there is a seven in the ones place and there is a one in the hundredths place	1.0
	Is there a one in the hundredths place in this one	2.0
No	What place value is the one in	8.0
Ones	The hundredths is the second from the right	1.0
	Now I found it interesting that both of my friends who shared said all the words correctly but did not put them in place correctly	1.0
	Place value is important	1.0
	You have to understand place value in order to do more complex math	1.0
	All right let s try another one	1.0
	If I don t have the chart handy then you have to figure out how to solve that problem	1.0
	Could you write this on your own board as a reference from your memory	2.0
Yes	Yes	4.0
	If you don t remember it should you maybe get on  Academy and do some place value work or study that	2.0
Yes	Yes okay	2.0
	Then you When I read it twice you should doublecheck your work	1.0
	The first time Nora maybe you put in your lines and you fill them in	1.0
	Then the second time I read it then you re doublechecking is that in the right spot	2.0
	All right so my second one	1.0
	I have an eight in the thousandths place a three in the tenths place a five in the tenths place and a six in the hundredths place	1.0
	I will read that again	1.0
	Hold on I m going to read it one more time	1.0
	Sorry	1.0
	An eight in the thousandths place a three in the tenths place a five in the tenths place and a six in the hundredths place	1.0
	Could you put the marker up on the counter right there and then only when it s time to write and you grab it and write	1.0
	Mila grab the mic	1.0
	My pen is next to my computer	1.0
	Write what you have	1.0
	Share your thinking	1.0
	Use the mic friends	1.0
I did this number because	What number is that	8.0
30 and 568	Almost	1.0
	Who can coach Mila	3.0
	What is the one thing she s missing when she read that number	3.0
	Go ahead and  number	2.0
	What	2.0
	You forgot to say what  the place value	8.0
Oh thousandths	Say the whole thing again	2.0
30 and 568 thousandths	Perfect	1.0
	Now class say that number	2.0
	Thank you	1.0
	It s been a while since we practiced	1.0
	Go ahead	2.0
She said put a five in the tenths and then a six in the hundredths and eight in the thousandths	All right	1.0
	I really like how Mila put a zero as a place holder	5.0
	Because if you used these lines to help you and you put the three in the tenths and you had the five here you noticed there is a place value in the middle of the two numbers that s blank	1.0
	We can never have blank	1.0
	Zero means nothing is there	1.0
	Now my friends who wrote this my guess is you did not use the strategy of the two lines and you wrote the three but what place value does this three have	8.0
	What place value does this three right here have	8.0
	It does not have the tens	1.0
	Let s take a look at our chart	1.0
	It is one number next to the decimal point which makes it ones	1.0
	If you wrote it the first time and then doublechecked your answer the second time you might see Whoa this isnt the ones	1.0
	I did something wrong	1.0
	So make sure youre doing that doublechecking	1.0
	Our last problem	1.0
	Come over to my book again erase your number	1.0
	I have a two in the hundreds place a four in the thousandths place and a seven in the tenths place	1.0
	What number am I	8.0
	I have a two in the hundreds place	1.0
	Listen carefully because a very small change in what I say changes place value	1.0
	A four in the hundredths place and a seven in the Sorry a four in the thousandths place	1.0
	Sorry about that	1.0
	And a seven in the tenths place	1.0
	Because I misspoke Ill read it one more time just so were clear	1.0
	Two in the hundreds place four in the thousandths place and a seven in the tenths place	1.0
		1.0
Then you didnt say anything else so I filled in the blanks with zeros	Now I noticed most students improving	1.0
	The couple that I saw Ron had the two in the hundredths place and I tried to be really clear in emphasizing that I said hundreds not hundredth	5.0
	I tried to be really obvious with that	1.0
	So you have to listen carefully because the difference is just that TH All right boys and girls	1.0
	Today were going to be Hold on	1.0
	Today were going to be working on some word problems or a word problem	1.0
	I have a little bit of learning to do before we start the word problem	1.0
	This is one of those twoday pieces	1.0
	Where the first day we solve the problem and then the second day I look at common errors and we get to improve our problem for our grade	1.0
	Ill take a volunteer because I left my cards over there and I dont feel like making my way back	1.0
	Friend can you cap your marker please and put it down	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
I can solve a question number  by interpreting	Interpreting	1.0
interpreting a drawing that  I cant say it	Situation	1.0
	All right so the word interpreting is highlighted	1.0
	What does interpret mean	8.0
	What does interpret mean	8.0
	Talk chat with your partner please	2.0
	What does interpret mean	8.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	What do you think Tayden	8.0
I think it means that you guess	Okay	1.0
	Wheres my active listening	1.0
	Hannah what do you think	8.0
To convince someone	Convince	4.0
	We have guess we have convince	1.0
	Phoenix what do you think	8.0
Like make or	Make	2.0
	Okay so we have convince guess and make	5.0
	And Ill say none of the above	1.0
	Interpret means to understand	1.0
	When were interpreting something we are trying to understand or figure out the meaning	1.0
	My friends who say Thats what I said good	1.0
	That means you had it right	1.0
	You dont need to announce it to theSSthough or you could raise your hand and say when we heard three answers that you disagreed with you could raise your hand and say I think something different	1.0
	When we interpret something we understand or figure out the meaning	1.0
	Please tell your partner what does interpret mean	8.0
	Go	2.0
	In a little bit youre going to hear a story problem that has to do with fractions and you are going to have to make a drawing to model the situation and then figure out or understand what that drawing and what is going on with the situation	1.0
	I know I can do this when Class read the first one	1.0
	Show	1.0
	What does that mean that you need to do if youre showing	8.0
	Rory	2.0
We need to show like make a picture of how much they took and then Yes	You can show with a picture	5.0
	Can we show with anything else other than a picture	8.0
	Yes we could show with You mean like words	2.0
Yes	You could show with words	1.0
	Could we show with numbers	2.0
Yes	We could show with numbers	1.0
	Now according to our target we have a drawing here	1.0
	I think Rory we definitely need to do what Rory said which is the picture piece but we also will have to do those other two pieces too	1.0
	All right when I point to it read the next success	1.0
	Whats a number model	8.0
	Chat with your partner	2.0
	Five four three two and one	1.0
	whats a number model	8.0
A number model is showing what youre adding or subtracting or multiplying	Okay so a number model is going to be a number some sort of operation and then another number	1.0
	The number model is the actual problem that were doing	1.0
	I see a number model over there	1.0
	Today yes youre going to have to do a picture but youre also going to have to give a number model to show what that picture represents all right	2.0
	When I point read	2.0
	All right so explain	8.0
	Boys and girls what do I need to use when I explain	8.0
Words	Words	4.0
	And what kind of words	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	Then the final one which actually should be the first one because before you can do all of this stuff you have to do this right here	1.0
	Were actually going to spend some time today on this part before we solve it	1.0
	When I point read	1.0
	Weve been doing this part for a while	1.0
	Today Im really wanting to emphasize this part	1.0
	Because a lot of you are annotating and youre underlining and then you still have no clue what the question is asking	1.0
	If youre just underlining a bunch of stuff and calling it a day because Ms  wants to see underlining but thats not the point	1.0
	The point of annotating which by the way is underlining plus words the point of annotating is figuring out what is this problem asking me to do	8.0
	And that is a continued issue so were going to spend some time with strategies for that today	1.0
Youre basically annotating right now	I am arent I	1.0
	Good point	1.0
	Good point pointing that out friend	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I dont want to spend a ton of time on this because this is a bit confusing in and of itself but before we start our lesson today I want to talk about another point of confusion	1.0
	And it is confusing	1.0
	The fifth grade teachers were debating this yesterday when we were having our plan time the fifth grade teachers were debating that poster	1.0
	Im not having you write down notes for it	1.0
	Ill put the poster back there so you can take a look at it	1.0
	I want to talk about before we start looking at our problem today whats the difference between fraction multiplication and fraction subtraction	8.0
	Because theyre very very easy to mix up	1.0
	Yes	2.0
For a fraction was it addition	Pardon	2.0
Was it addition	Addition	2.0
	Well addition doesnt seem	1.0
Subtraction	Subtraction	4.0
	I was like Doesnt seem as confusing	1.0
For multiplication you dont have to find a common denominator and you can just multiply the denominators	I agree	1.0
	When we are doing a subtraction problem Im going to ask that you put your marker up on this table until it is time to use it	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	When we are actually doing the problems like Kevin has said we find a common denominator to subtract	1.0
	Then multiplication we just multiply across	1.0
	What is confusing to lots of students is when you have a word problem when do we subtract	8.0
	When do we multiply	8.0
	So I have this poster here to help us	1.0
	When you are subtracting you are taking away	1.0
	This is where it gets confusing because when youre multiplying in a way youre taking away but the question is  differently	1.0
	The keywords are going to be really important in figuring out do I subtract or do I multiply	8.0
	What keywords do we see here	8.0
	Lets try that again with the wholeSSparticipating	1.0
	Because until I gave you a hint on that constructed response we did on Wednesday everybody was subtracting and Im not going to give you a hint forever	1.0
	Im not going to give you a hint today Im not going to give you a hint on CMAS so its really important that you guys can interpret these questions and what to do without me hinting	1.0
	So lets try that again	1.0
	What keywords do we look for for subtraction	8.0
	For example if I have a half of the pizza and Seth ate a third more of the pizza and the question is how much is left that would be a subtraction problem because its asking how much is left of the pizza	8.0
	How much remains of the pizza	8.0
	What is the difference between what I ate and what Seth ate	8.0
	Those keywords help with subtraction	1.0
	When were doing multiplication its so similar so I get why its confusing	1.0
	Its part of a part or part of a whole	1.0
	Weve got that one up there 46 times 12 thats part of a whole	1.0
	What is 46 of 12	8.0
	The keyword here is of	1.0
	What is tricky is sometimes youre going to see of in an adding problem a division problem a subtraction problem	1.0
	So you have to really be careful that youre thinking Okay whats it asking	1.0
	Is it asking for 14 of 34	2.0
	Is it asking for a fraction of a fraction or a fraction of a whole	2.0
	Does the question ask for the whole unit	2.0
	I might say I ate a third of the pizza	1.0
	Seth ate half of what I ate	1.0
	How much of the pizza did Seth eat	1.0
	Because were asking for how much of the whole pizza Ellie were going to multiply were not going to subtract	1.0
	Whereas if I were to say How much of the pizza is left	1.0
	Thats a keyword for subtraction	1.0
	Were going to subtract were not going to multiply	1.0
	This is really key here is the question the answer asking for the fraction related to the whole	1.0
	Again were going to look at some problems really quickly and Im going to ask you to stand up so we can get a little bit of movement	1.0
	Put yourself to the side and stand up	1.0
	Can you pass me the  right there	1.0
	Im going to ask you if it is a multiplication problem to go stand on that side of the room	1.0
	If it is a subtraction problem to stand on this side of the room	1.0
	If it is neither multiplication or subtraction youre going to stand in the back	1.0
	Point where do you stand for multiplication	8.0
	Subtraction	8.0
	Neither	8.0
	Subtraction	8.0
	Neither	8.0
	Subtraction	8.0
	Neither	8.0
	Subtraction	8.0
	Multiplication	8.0
	Neither	8.0
	Okay	1.0
	If youre confused then what can you do	8.0
Ask somebody	Ask a question	5.0
	Seth hands are to ourselves	1.0
	All right	1.0
	I am going to read the question and it is up here and youre going to share with me what do you think by moving your bodies this question is asking	1.0
	Is it asking you to multiply	2.0
	Is it asking you to subtract	2.0
	Or is it asking you neither of those two operations which means division or addition	2.0
	Thinking of what we just had on the poster no I dont expect you to be an expert but you can look at that	1.0
Thats multiply	Sorry multiplication because thats what were working on	5.0
	Multiplication subtraction neither	1.0
	All right so we dont have an agreement here	1.0
	Were all mixed up	1.0
	Every part has other people so take about 30 seconds right now to talk with others in your group about why are you there	9.0
	So when I pull your card youre ready	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Five four three two one	1.0
	I heard Because	1.0
	I want to hear very clear specific sentences	1.0
	I think multiplication because	1.0
	I think neither because	1.0
	I think subtraction because	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Okay five four three two and one	1.0
	I see some people changing their mind	1.0
	You can change your mind as long as you can explain why	1.0
	Josiah share your thinking	8.0
	Where are you at Josiah first of all	8.0
	At the neither	1.0
It doesnt tell you	But it does tell you what operation in the clues of the problem	1.0
	You have to do something	1.0
	This is a real word problem	1.0
	In fact on a test youre going to be taking probably in a week or so before spring break theres a problem almost exactly like this on it	1.0
How do you know	Because I made the test	1.0
	Okay so it does tell us	1.0
	Josiah my question is thinking about what I see here do you see any of the fraction or the subtraction keywords like left difference or remain Josiah	8.0
No	Pardon	2.0
No	No	2.0
	No subtraction keywords	2.0
	All right Im going to throw it to my subtraction friends here	1.0
	Josiah said he didnt see subtraction keywords so tell me why do you think its subtraction	9.0
So that s subtracting I think	Are we taking something away	2.0
	Boys	2.0
No	No	2.0
	And do we see any of those keywords there	2.0
	So its not subtraction	1.0
	Were down to either multiplication or neither	1.0
	You guys need to make a choice based on what that saying where are you going to join	1.0
	Im going to put this over here	1.0
	Somebody grab it who thinks they can share	1.0
	Thank you	1.0
	For zeros	1.0
It s also asking how much glasses of the	How many	1.0
How much glasses	How many	1.0
How many glasses girls wear	Okay I want everyone to come back to the rug	1.0
	I want you to sit or squat just so everybody can see the problem but were going to be getting up again so dont make yourself too comfortable	1.0
	Friends I shouldnt need to wait so long	1.0
	This problem is multiplication and as we look at our poster there there is some really big hints	1.0
	First of all weve already talked about how theres nothing about subtraction	1.0
	So that one should have been written off right away	1.0
	Were not taking anything away and there are no keywords that show subtraction	1.0
	Now I see the word of right here	1.0
	Heres another one of	1.0
	We have 25 girls thats a part and then we have 18 of those girls	1.0
	See how these are both girls	2.0
	That shows me Im looking for a part of a part	1.0
	That makes it a fraction of the problem	1.0
	Another clue that its multiplication is the question says how much of the whole class	1.0
	And when its fraction of a clue is that the answer is what fraction of the actual whole	1.0
	Even though this question isn t about boys its still asking what fraction of the whole class	8.0
	Another thing I should probably add to my poster in figuring out is that when were looking for part of a part were looking for that same unit	1.0
	That helps us know were doing part of a part	1.0
	Yes	2.0
Well it also says of again	Youre right	1.0
	18 of the girls and this is showing us its that same unit	1.0
	Its that I am looking for girls with glasses out of all the girls of the class	1.0
	Then the question is of the whole class	1.0
	Those are all the clues that helped me know its multiplication	1.0
	With your partner I want you to paraphrase	8.0
	What are the clues that helped you know its multiplication so we can recognize them if there are more multiplication problems	1.0
	Go	2.0
	Okay waterfall	1.0
	Heres a new one	1.0
	A farm is in the shape of a rectangle 18 of a mile long and 25 of a mile wide	1.0
	What is the area of the farm	1.0
	Rory where are you at	2.0
	Take a moment	1.0
	Were unanimous it looks like but take a moment to chat with somebody close to you because I might choose your card	1.0
	Why do you think this problem is multiplication	9.0
	I want  Stop	1.0
	I want to hear a complete sentence the problem is multiplication because	9.0
	Go	2.0
	All right friends	1.0
	Amy why multiplication	9.0
Then for area you have to multiply	Whats the formula for area	8.0
Width times length	Perfect	1.0
	I think that is the biggest key	1.0
	As soon as you saw this word area length times width Im multiplying	1.0
	Nice	1.0
	Come on back so you can see the next problem	1.0
	A pizza is cut into eight slices	1.0
	There is 15 of the pizza	1.0
	If Jamie eats another slice 18 of the original whole pizza which fraction of the original pizza is left over	1.0
	Im working your thigh muscles then with that up and down	1.0
	Okay it looks like were unanimous again so chat really quickly so youre ready to share	1.0
	Why do you think subtraction	9.0
	Waterfall	1.0
	Its one or the other	1.0
	Ellis whats your thinking	9.0
My thinking is I think it s subtraction because it says left over at the end of the problem	You are correct	1.0
	Now Josiah is pointing something out	1.0
	He is saying that it says of so we have 25 of a pizza	1.0
	Then he eats another slice which is 18 of the original pizza	1.0
	I emphasized that and maybe I sounded silly in emphasizing it but I emphasized it for a purpose	1.0
	Remember this one was both girls girlsgirls	1.0
	This is not part of a part	1.0
	This says 18 back to that original pizza	1.0
	It doesnt say 18 of that pizza he ate	1.0
	So thats a difference	1.0
	Then of course the kicker is what Ellis said	1.0
	The question asked leftover thats a subtraction keyword	1.0
	All right next one	1.0
	In Sams fifth Why dont we just freeze where we are and listen and if you need to pause and read it you can	1.0
	In Sams fifthgrade class 18 of the students are boys	1.0
	Of these boys 25 have red hair	1.0
	What fraction of theSSis redhaired boys	1.0
	All right were almost unanimous but not quite	1.0
	Bryson whats your thinking	9.0
I think its multiplication because it says of at the end of the problem	Okay I need more though because this problem also said of so that cant be our only clue	5.0
	Lennox what other clue	8.0
It says What fraction of the class	Okay so what about that is a clue	8.0
Its a fraction of the	Okay so weve got a fraction of the class	5.0
	Thats referring to the whole	1.0
	Then if I look at this I have 18 boys and then I have 25 of those boys again	1.0
	Just like the girl problem were looking at part of a part or a part of a part	1.0
	Yes it does say what fraction of theSSand fraction of problems are multiplication	1.0
	Were going to do one more Actually theres two more	1.0
	Alex was planting a garden	1.0
	He planted 25 of the garden with potatoes and 18 of the garden with lettuce	1.0
	What fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce	8.0
	Can we be respectful of peoples stuff on the ground	1.0
	Watch where were walking when its crowded with stuff	1.0
	All right we have a little bit of a difference here	1.0
	Sage why are you where youre at	9.0
Im in this one because	Whats this one	8.0
Like you have to figure out the fraction of it like just a fraction	Okay	1.0
	Well if youre figuring out what fraction of multiplication is fraction of	1.0
	So what youre saying might support multiplication	1.0
	Remember division is dividing into equal parts	1.0
	Are they dividing it into equal parts	2.0
	Josiah please stop disturbing our learning	1.0
	I asked a classmate a question give him the think time	1.0
	Are we dividing into equal parts	2.0
No	My friends all here in the middle the middle is nothing	1.0
	You have to choose a side please	1.0
	You either are back against the counter Conor or youre over here because I cant tell where you are right now	1.0
	Youre just hanging out in no mans land	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Lea where are you at	8.0
	What do you think	8.0
I know its not subtraction because youre not subtracting	Natalie are you listening to your classmate	2.0
I think its  you how much youre planting	Okay	1.0
	Let me throw it to someone else over here whos in the neither	1.0
	Weve got an argument for multiplication	1.0
	She said she sees the word of and its asking for fraction of the garden	1.0
	what do you think	9.0
I think its neither and maybe addition because it says he planted 25	Boys stop it	1.0
When it says that it seems like their adding both of them to figure out in total how many potatoes and lettuce there is in the garden	All right so I saw some people switch sides	1.0
	You shouldnt have	1.0
	Friends this is the trickiest question of them all because it really has a lot of clues that look like multiplication	1.0
	It says this it says of and it says what fraction of the garden	1.0
	However theres one important thing that shows that its not multiplication	1.0
	This is 25 of potatoes	1.0
	This is 18 of lettuce	1.0
	A part of a part has to be the same girls and girls boys and boys mile and mile	1.0
	Are these the same	2.0
	Lettuce and potatoes	2.0
No	No theyre not the same so it cannot be multiplication	1.0
	As  said it is asking for the total of potatoes and lettuce	1.0
	So it is an addition problem	1.0
	Yes	2.0
	What has this shown you	8.0
	Is it always	2.0
No	No	4.0
	Thats why its so important  to understand what is going on in the question	1.0
	You cant just say I see the word of	1.0
	I see this word	1.0
	That means that we multiply because I see of because it says fraction of	1.0
	You have to understand what is the question really asking	1.0
	You have to look at the big picture	1.0
	This had tons of multiplication keywords but it wasnt asking for the part of the part because these are two different things	1.0
	I cant do multiplication for two very different things	1.0
	Thats not what multiplication means	1.0
	If we think of our area model we were splitting one thing into parts right	2.0
	Well these are two different things	1.0
	I cant split them like that	1.0
	Last one	1.0
	The track at school is 25 of a mile long	1.0
	If Jason has run 18 of a way around the track what fraction of a mile has he run	1.0
Ran	It says run	1.0
Im pretty sure its supposed to say ran	Its not	1.0
	My friends whispering I hope youre only whispering about why you are here and what told you it was subtraction	1.0
	Rory	2.0
I think its subtraction because It doesnt have any keywords for subtraction but	Then what makes it subtraction	8.0
	If it doesnt have any keywords what would make it subtraction	8.0
	Are you changing your mind	2.0
	Okay were going to freeze	1.0
	I really like how Rory when he had to explain the why Natalie I asked you to freeze	1.0
	That means you	1.0
	That doesnt mean everybody but you	1.0
	I like how when Rory was asked to explain he realized he was on the wrong side	1.0
	I think we have some herd mentality here	1.0
	There are no keywords that mean subtraction	1.0
	Were not taking away	1.0
	Its not asking for how much is left how much of the track does he have left to run	1.0
	Its not asking for whats the remaining amount of the track	1.0
	In fact weve got 25 of a mile and then 18 of a mile because its of the track and the track is 25 of a mile so thats part of a part	1.0
	Then the question is what fraction of a mile which means that were asking for the answer in relation to the whole mile	1.0
	Everything in this problem says multiplication	1.0
	So in coming to the subtraction that shows me we dont have an understanding yet	1.0
	Were not looking at the big picture and maybe we have some herd mentality Oh everyone is walking this way so will I	1.0
	Grab your stuff and return to your seat please	1.0
	You have 20 seconds to do so	1.0
What you could do is you could take off two wholes and make it four and then you could minus the four	All right	1.0
Watching me	Okay did everybody get a note sheet	1.0
Guys pay attention	All right	1.0
	The first one were looking square A	1.0
	What does it represent	8.0
I did not get one either	The first one	1.0
	One 10 a hundred	1.0
One 10 a hundred	One 10 and a hundred	1.0
	Rose can you help  because he didnt bring his glasses so he cant see	1.0
	Now read the first one Daniel	2.0
What does square A represent	No	1.0
	We already did that	1.0
10 times	10 times as much as it would be	5.0
First place	Worth in the place to its right	1.0
About	Not about	1.0
Is exactly	Worth is not It isnt as is	1.0
	Is worth onetenth times as much as it would be worth in the	8.0
Place	place to its	8.0
Left	left	4.0
	For your notes here is a place value chart with adjustments	1.0
	If we think of a regular place chart when we go this way it gets bigger	1.0
	Here we have our decimal point	1.0
	When it goes this way it gets smaller	1.0
	If you have 110 of the piece which is the first one its a bigger piece than 1100	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	10 tenths	1.0
	What did you say	2.0
I said 10100	10100 yes	5.0
Then a hundred a thousand	All right	1.0
	Okay will you sit in	1.0
Why dont  swivel to Chase	Can you move it	1.0
Move this	Can you move it over	1.0
	Be careful	1.0
I think it keeps turning off on swivel	Open your journal page to 112	1.0
	Shh	1.0
	Were doing it together	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Im going to give you Im going to say some decimals and youre going to write it down	1.0
Wait can we have a snack	Is the swivle on	1.0
No the camera is on but the swible is like	Okay push the little button	1.0
The plus	No the other one	1.0
	The minus	1.0
No its focusing on Ms Carroll	Did it stay on	1.0
Probably	It is	1.0
Turn	Is this working	1.0
	It worked	1.0
Turn right	Okay Michael please go do your work	1.0
Max	That didnt work	1.0
Turn right	Heres the first one	1.0
Stalker	tell me you cant do it because we cant be	1.0
We can do it	I hope so	1.0
	I hope you guys do a better job	1.0
	Here we go	1.0
	The first one is five and 16100	1.0
What are we doing	You write it in this first	1.0
Five and 16100	This is a ten this a hundred this is a thousand	1.0
	This is a one	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Its five and 16100	5.0
	If you have that your five single and your whole numbers	1.0
	Yes thats your ones and then 16100	1.0
	You want to go to the hundredths place so youre	1.0
Like that	No	1.0
You want to write the tenths	You only have one digit	1.0
	No you only have one digit per place	1.0
You want to go 5016	You went all the way to the thousands	1.0
		4.0
	Whatever the last thing is thats where you go	1.0
	Shh	1.0
	Hey I need my hexagons not to be talking	1.0
Okay that makes a lot more sense	It should look 516	1.0
	Youre into the thousands	1.0
	We have 516	1.0
	We start with the hundredths	1.0
	516 we stop at the hundredths because it said five and 16100	1.0
	Whatever your last name is hundredths thats the last place you put a digit	1.0
Wherever it says last number goes	Thats where your Okay heres the next one	1.0
Thats where you should stop at	Whats the value of the six	8.0
6100	6100 and that one	5.0
	The next one 810	1.0
	Write 810	1.0
Its a 08	Okay thats a whole number	1.0
	That means you have eight What that says is 810	1.0
	You have eight and 10100	1.0
	You have eight and tenths	1.0
	Each 110	1.0
	Weve got to get I didnt say a whole number	1.0
You said eight	I said 810	1.0
You said 810	Thats 8100	1.0
	Okay Victoria you have it	1.0
	No Parker	1.0
	Yes Joey	1.0
	Theres no whole number	1.0
	Maria let me see yours	1.0
	Okay thats in the hundredths	1.0
	Hey stop shouting	1.0
	Sawyer youre in the hundredths	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	We dont have an eight in the first one	1.0
	You have eight	2.0
	An eight	2.0
Yes	Get rid of the first eight because thats eight and 810	1.0
	Everybody get that one	2.0
Yes	Okay good	1.0
	Whats the value of the eight	8.0
	810	4.0
	Okay heres the next one	1.0
	This ones a little more challenging	1.0
	Two and 3071000	1.0
Say that again please	Two and 3071000	1.0
	Thats 371000	1.0
	3071000	1.0
Ms Carroll	Is this it Ms Carroll	1.0
	Its not 237	1.0
	Its 307 Max	1.0
	Was it 507	2.0
Its 2307	Were putting one in each spot	1.0
	Lila what are you doing	8.0
	Yes	1.0
	Rose what did you do	8.0
	Thats two and 371000	1.0
	Its two and 3071000	1.0
	Okay everybody get it	2.0
	Rose did you change yours	2.0
	Okay next one	1.0
	Seven	1.0
	Wait whats the value of seven in the last one	8.0
71000	71000	4.0
	Sawyer	2.0
	Okay lets see	1.0
	Heres the next one	1.0
	Seven and 9100	1.0
	Thats 910	1.0
Ms Carroll	Let me see yours	1.0
	Thats seven and 910	1.0
	Shh	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now heres one thing that I noticed	1.0
	Sawyer do have it written down	2.0
	Seven and 9100	1.0
	Heres what I noticed	1.0
	Now remember I said hundredths was its last name	1.0
	Some of you put a zero in the thousandths	1.0
	Why	9.0
If you were writing it as a normal number  79		4.0
	Heres what Im going to say	1.0
	They both have the same value	1.0
	Youre writing that	1.0
	One thing that I want you to practice is when If it says hundredths it stops at the hundredths okay	2.0
	They are the same number	1.0
	Thats why it said people were correct	1.0
Okay	All right	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Now heres what I want you to do	1.0
	With you two	1.0
	You two	1.0
	These two	1.0
	Aria and Chloe Anne and Max Sawyer and Asher Rose and Victoria Alexandra and Daniel Carson and Zach	1.0
	Youre going to write down one and then youre going to give it to your partner	1.0
	Youre going to make sure you both have the same answer	1.0
	Okay for example	1.0
Student	Well you each are gonna do one	1.0
	If I write down a number and then I tell it to Zach	1.0
	Its on my paper	1.0
	Then hes going to write it on his paper	1.0
	Then lets have the person whose birthday is closest to today	1.0
	Then switch and then the other person goes first	1.0
	You should have two each	1.0
	Go	1.0
	Sawyer when is your birthday	1.0
	Whens your birthday	1.0
Its July 9th	April	1.0
	April	1.0
	Aprils first	1.0
	Okay this groups already done with one	1.0
	You should have two	1.0
	Okay on your slate	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	When youre done get your slate and your marker because were going to write these decimals as fractions	1.0
	Good job	1.0
	Okay heres the first one	1.0
	Shh	1.0
	Hey listen	1.0
	Heres the first one	1.0
	Youre going to write this the threetenths as a fraction on your slate	1.0
	Threetenths	1.0
	We dont have much	1.0
	You got it	1.0
Ms Carroll	Got it	1.0
Wait you want threetenths as a decimal or a fraction	Fraction	1.0
	Got it	1.0
	Once you have it  once I say yes	1.0
	I cant see that Sawyer	1.0
	Got it got it got it	1.0
	Okay next one	1.0
	0082	1.0
Thousandths	N 082	1.0
Im like No I dont	Got it got it got it	1.0
Boom	Got it got it	1.0
	As a fraction	1.0
	Got it	1.0
	Got it	1.0
	Got it got it got it	1.0
	Got it Max	1.0
	Okay next one	1.0
Cant you see Im trying	0914	1.0
	0914	1.0
	0914	1.0
Lets go	No	1.0
	Hes not right	1.0
	Thats right	1.0
	Okay next	1.0
	Okay this one	1.0
	This has a whole number	1.0
	This is going to be a mixed number	1.0
	586	1.0
	Ms Carroll	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Yes yes	1.0
	No decimal	1.0
Ms Carroll	No	1.0
	Teacher	1.0
You go it wrong	Sit down Rose	1.0
	You have	1.0
	This is your fraction	1.0
	Okay one more	1.0
	Shh	1.0
	One more	1.0
	206	1.0
Ms Carroll	Shh	1.0
	Okay	1.0
	Give me Shh	1.0
	Emerson will you push the red button	1.0
Right here	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	Lets talk about exploration one	1.0
	Looking at the paired function by comparison Heres actually the answers so you can check your work really quickly	1.0
	Now well review transformation theres two choices	1.0
	Were either modifying X or were modifying the entire function	1.0
	For this first one did we modify X or the entire function	8.0
	What do you think	8.0
	What did we do	8.0
	What did we modify	8.0
	X	7.0
	We modified X	5.0
	If we modify the whole function it would look something like this	1.0
	Our first graph is only modifying X just to get this idea	1.0
	Now do we just modify X or do we modify the whole function here	8.0
	Right	1.0
	Because weve put a negative sign in front of the existing function	1.0
	We modified the whole function	1.0
	Then this guy	8.0
	Modify X you think	2.0
	No its the whole function	7.0
	It is the whole function	4.0
	It did because theres the x 3 that we see have 2	1.0
	All right so that modified X	1.0
	Then this last one did we modify X or the whole function	8.0
	This last one	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Because we modified X then we modify the whole function	1.0
	When I have something like x 3 if Im modifying X Im going to have something with X in it thats cubed	1.0
	Thats where I see these parentheses happening	1.0
	If Im modifying the function it looks like that	1.0
	Now and C should be modifying the function too right	2.0
	I got lost track	1.0
	All right	1.0
	This becomes important because it tells us what were supposed to do	1.0
	If Im modifying X what happened	8.0
	Hallway partner explain what happens when you modify X	8.0
	Here we go modify X	1.0
	What do you think about that	3.0
	We trust Bu low and Bu low we trust	1.0
	All right so	1.0
	Now lets do the same type of thing thinking about what is it that were supposed to modify and work with some  You just got two to look at	1.0
	Go ahead and get started with the two here	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen lets talk about these two	1.0
	As our pairing function translated here and resulted in this did it modify X or did it modify the whole thing	8.0
	It modified the whole thing	7.0
	Right	1.0
	Were seeing the modification in X here and were seeing the modification to the whole function there	5.0
	Duplicates so these have both things going on	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Now the toolkit is going to begin with the piece of paper that you have there	1.0
	If you would go ahead and pull out your toolkit	1.0
	All right so lets update the tracker	1.0
	Update your table of contents	1.0
	All right on the lefthand side we have the keynotes with regards to solving polynomials	1.0
	The overall process factor use the zero product property and then you can graph them	1.0
	The only thing thats really new from 35 was the rational root theorem	1.0
	This is as its expressed mathematically the rational root theorem	1.0
	Then for this example down here I basically prompted you all the way through it	1.0
	While the big ideas are the factor use the zero product property and then graph I broke it down more thoroughly as you go through the example	1.0
	Include the props and then whatever space you need to actually do them	1.0
	Dont write all these props out until you just do the first steps see how much space you need and so on	1.0
	Note though that I did write up here a couple of other ideas	1.0
	First we need to have our equations that equal to zero	1.0
	All of the factoring stuff that you learned in Math II is all fair game including the quadratic formula	1.0
	If you dont remember what the quadratic formula is then refresh your memory on that	1.0
	In 34 we had all kinds of factoring so some major types	1.0
	You can expect to see a lot of factoring on the test	1.0
	Yes	2.0
	There is yes	1.0
	Is it worth learning	7.0
	Yes it would be worth learning	5.0
	Weve already had it in 34	1.0
	It would both the sum and the difference so theres two formulas when it comes to cubes	1.0
	Then its factored	7.0
	Remember when its squared only the difference of squares can be factored	5.0
	The sum of squares cant be factored so there are three patterns along those lines the sums and the differences	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	This will work for everything	1.0
	Since were setting this ratio if my leading coefficient is 1 its fairly simple	1.0
	Fairly straightforward	1.0
	If my leading coefficient is something other than 1 then Im going to really increase the number of options for what the factors could be	1.0
	Our first example is with a 1	1.0
	It simplifies the number of fractions of possible factors	1.0
	Then the second example well have something other than 1 for the leading coefficient and I just havent picked that one yet	1.0
	The only thing right now we have for this toolkit is just what I gave you	1.0
	Now it might be interesting to note on here as a way of studying and looking for patterns is to whether or not were modifying X or were modifying the whole function	1.0
	For example when I look at this am I modifying X or the whole function	8.0
	Youre modifying X	7.0
	Im modifying X	5.0
	Thats the whole function	7.0
	Thats how the whole function is going to look like	5.0
	I just copied that function and Im adding something to it	1.0
	What happens here	8.0
	Am I modifying X or am I modifying the whole function	8.0
	Modifying X	7.0
	Just X	5.0
	Then this one is showing that I modified	8.0
	The whole function so whatever that function is its all of it	1.0
	Youre modifying the whole thing	1.0
	Here am I modifying X or the whole function	8.0
	Just X	1.0
	Here Im modifying the whole function	1.0
	You notice we have cases where were adding and subtracting	1.0
	Were changing signs and were multiplying	1.0
	In both cases its a different effect if were doing it to just X which I see as I go down here	1.0
	Or if Im doing it to the whole function as I see in those	1.0
	It might not be a bad idea to go through and maybe highlight the ones and just make a note	1.0
	Im modifying just X in that case	1.0
	I like the others	1.0
	Im modifying the whole function	1.0
	Probably before the end of the day Ill have the examples to do but its just going to be this and a couple of examples	1.0
	All right	1.0
	The next thing to turn your attention to is If you need glue sticks Ill pull those down too if you want to go ahead and get them glued in	1.0
	Otherwise lets move on to the extra practice in the journal so page 93	1.0
	Its the sixth	1.0
	Let me doublecheck	1.0
	Yes it should be the sixth one	1.0
	It should be the next one	1.0
	The what	1.0
	How do we figure that out	8.0
	Right	1.0
	What would we have to know	8.0
	Typically what are things that wed graph for here	8.0
	Whats our strategy	8.0
	If I take a function and I changed everything has that affected X or Y	2.0
	What we want to do is we want to be able to distinguish  Changing the whole thing	1.0
	Yes in this case	1.0
	Lets go as far as we can	1.0
	I have a theory X3 and X7 which is a septic they are undiscernible on a graph except  does it become more discernible when you add like 4x to it	1.0
	Correct	1.0
	You are being very disruptive	1.0
	Lets keep going on this	1.0
	In some ways its easier because we should be familiar with these ideas	1.0
	I think the challenge in this test	1.0
	If we find out that 1 has a 0 remainder then we know that x is the factor and what I have down here from my synthetic division tells me what if you started with the  what the cubic is	1.0
	What the cubic could look like	1.0
	You can look at the cubic and go maybe thats something that you would know how to factor	1.0
	Maybe you could recognise that its a part of no	1.0
	Thats the key that tells us that thats an actual factor	1.0
	Ladies and gentlemen the answers for 37 are up here	1.0
	Youre free to check what youve already got	1.0
	G has modified X and then modified the function	1.0
	How are you just modify X	1.0
	That should start with that step	1.0
	How would rewrite this if all was doing is modifying X like that	8.0
	Where would you put the negative	8.0
	We write this with just that one translation	1.0
	What would you do	8.0
	Did the second bell ring	1.0
	All right	1.0
	Were just going to take a short break until five after	1.0
	Then were going to come back for a quiz	1.0
	It will be a team quiz and you can use your toolkit and your textbook	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen lets turn into teams	1.0
	This is going to be no calculators but you	1.0
	Lets put the journals away and you can pick your toolkits and textbooks	1.0
	You can use textbooks but no calculator	1.0
	Phones should be off and off of you	1.0
	Calculators need to be put away	1.0
	Thats not your answer	1.0
	They model up	1.0
	Did you get the xintercept	2.0
	It says solve	1.0
	In other words the values of the variables could make that	1.0
	You do not enter the standard form you wont see a square root but you could have a factor that has a square root	1.0
	You got to think of all four factors together	1.0
	When you look at  Does it look like that	2.0
	The only strategies we have listed right here	1.0
	These four and that one	1.0
	It got to be one of those five strategies	1.0
	If it doesnt then you got to use this	1.0
	So theres three terms	1.0
	Its either this or that	1.0
	You didnt write W2	1.0
	Look at the square	1.0
	It is good its time to learn now	1.0
	Pull out the example	1.0
	Theres only three examples in 35 so all the problems are those examples	1.0
	Yes	1.0
	When you have three terms of these theres only one that has got three terms	1.0
	After we are done with the quiz Ill show you how to do what you are asking about	1.0
	Its not quite straightforward	1.0
	All right ladies and gentlemen	1.0
	All right so the 35 homework thats what youre doing right now basically is like the 35 homework	1.0
	This is all 35 content	1.0
	Now of course 35 you cant do without factoring	1.0
	Its kind of a combination of 34 and 35	1.0
	Obviously how long have we spent on this now so far	1.0
	Think about whats next	1.0
	Whens our test	1.0
	Wednesday a shorter period	1.0
	You have to be able to do these kinds of things in about a halfhour	1.0
	In other words youve got to get to the point where you could take this packet and do it in about a halfhour or so	1.0
	Maybe	1.0
	Thats just the way the schedule worked out	1.0
	No we got Wednesday	1.0
	Thats why Im trying to get you to see	1.0
	Youve got to know how to do this right away	1.0
	Now what Id like to do we only have about five minutes left so put all of the quizzes together make sure youre turning them in as a team	1.0
	Then Ill probably give you time tomorrow	1.0
	Go ahead and turn them in and then you can leave the books on the desks	1.0
	If theres a specific type of problem you want to talk about before you leave thats why Im giving us a few minutes if you want any particular questions about any of the examples	1.0
	If you would go ahead and turn off the microphones for me and just leave them where they are	1.0
