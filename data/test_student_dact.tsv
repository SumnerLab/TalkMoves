Grant	So first you wrote the numbers	sd	4.0
So first you wrote the numbers	So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	sd	4.0
So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	sd	4.0
You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	Then you do 1800 divided by 100 which is 18 and then you do that minus or you do 120 minus 18 you get 102	sv	4.0

Okay so you think Which five the first five or the second five	The ninth	sd	3.0
Andrea	Because	sd	0.0
I need to know why its going there Jared	Because when they said eight has to go ten times the value of where the eight is so it would be going up a place	sd	4.0
Adrianna what do you want to add on	It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	sd	4.0
It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number	That means you would have to do 8 x 10 so that would be 80 and 80 would be in the tenth place	sd	4.0
Damien	It says Write a number that has nine and that 110 is not a full number so youre not going forward you have to go backwards	sd	4.0
If you multiply a whole number by a fraction	Its going to be	sd	0.0
3281595 does that number fit the rule	Where does three come from	sd	2.0
You could have switched numbers that would have been fine too just like whoever told me to put Was it Catalina	Yes	b	0.0
Heres what I would say in a problem like this even if you had multiple nines as long as you have a nine in the hundredth  as your Ms Carroll I dont know if that tells me that you fully understand	Well except theres an eight	sd	3.0
Well except theres an eight	It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	sd	1.0
It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine	Nine nine nine eight eight eight	sd	0.0
Allison lets hear yours	My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	sd	4.0
My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595	Then if you switch the eight with the six in 7568 that is how I got 7586595	sd	4.0
I understand that she gets it but she didnt say why	If she would have said The reason I put it there was because it said that it should be 10 times more so 8 x 10 is 80 which would make it get put in that place	sd	4.0
Adrianna lets hear yours	You want me to do the answers first	sd	0.0
I want you to read your explanation	I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	sd	4.0
I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955	What I did with the nine is I made it go to the 100th place because it says nine  is 110 the value so I would make the nine go in the one hundredth	sd	4.0
I dont know she might have	I dont get Never mind	sd	0.0
I got the final answer of 3281595	Thats because there was another 10	sd	4.0
Adrianna	If I multiplied 10 by eight would that be sort of three I guess	sd	4.0

Actually the big the whole  equal five	Are we doing it	sd	0.0
Are we doing it	You dont  but you dont the denominator	sd	3.0
Whats your strategy	because thats why got it wrong because you dont	sd	3.0
because thats why got it wrong because you dont	Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	sd	3.0
Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them	So I had fivetenths of it	sd	1.0
What is your strategy	So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	sd	3.0
So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these	Not the denominator	sd	1.0
Not the denominator	That s why she got it wrong	sd	1.0
So here if I were to divide this can I put on top of my fraction circle can I put three or fours on top of can I put the thirds on top of the fours	Thats what I did	sd	3.0
Its not going to be equal though	Its not going to be equal so you cant	sd	4.0

Yes	You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	sd	4.0
You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine	Yes because you did 34 x 3 then that equals 912	sd	4.0
From here to here	Okay	b	0.0
Okay	So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	sd	4.0
So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction	You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	sd	4.0
You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that	Then it would also be a whole because you had to take for 12 and 12 is whole	sd	4.0

Oh yes tell me why	if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	sd	4.0
if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16	But if you do 12 of a 15 it would be 110 and a 16 has a bigger fraction than	sd	4.0

Team Three what did you pick	We got 12 x 13	sd	3.0
Why did you pick that one	Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	sd	3.0
Probably the whole team said 12 x 13	So I just did the problem to make sure and	sd	0.0

Why do you say that Brendan	I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	sd	4.0
I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125	It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1	sd	4.0
Why do people have different answers but they still be correct	They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	sd	4.0
They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125	Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25	sd	4.0
What would you like to add to that Kyle	I agree with everybody but I also want to add that you could actuSSy answer that the same because you could make it a mixed number or an improper fraction	sd	4.0

Gabriel let me go back to my original question sorry why do the strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money	Because it shows	sd	0.0
Liola	I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole	sd	1.0

You want to add to that please	I agree with Liola but also decimal place its actually the same thing because if you have 7325 in money it practically would be the same just not with a thousand	sd	4.0
Sorry I didnt realize you said Bander sorry	I agree and I would also like to add on because when you write because when you say money you say 781 cents because of the decimal	sd	4.0
Parker	Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	sd	4.0
Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781	It depends on what it is  the cents and the whole number would be the dollars	sd	4.0

Yes try this one	15 x 10	sd	3.0
15 of 15 is	Three	sd	3.0
35 of 15 would be	Because its three groups	sd	4.0
Whats the connection between the two tables	Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	sd	4.0
Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule	Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	sd	4.0
Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two	Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	sd	4.0
Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10	Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	sd	4.0
Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25	Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	sd	4.0
Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two	Then we do 6 x 3 which is 18	sd	4.0
Why are we multiplying it by three	Because the rule is 35 instead of 15 so youd have to multiply it by three	sd	4.0
Felicia	Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	sd	4.0
Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much	That means youll have to take the 10 in the first one and the answer was 2 and then you have to multiply it by 3 to get the out of the next one	sd	4.0

Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2	So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	sd	4.0
So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35	Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	sd	4.0
Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two	Then since theres three twos we want to add them all together and that would be six	sd	4.0

I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50	I know that 5 x10  50 and thats why I got five	sd	4.0
Somebody that did it as division explain their thinking Rowdy	I did 50 divided 10 and I was trying to see how many groups of 10 were in 50 and I know that it is five	sd	4.0
Once you find what 15 is thats like the one but then you have three of them so you multiply those	Timesing the numerator	sd	3.0
What would you do Lexie	The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	sd	4.0
The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10	Yes 10th right	aa	4.0
Yes 10th right	So I thought the 50 would be so I had a dividing and multiplying and then once you know that thats five you would multiply it by seven because youre finding 710 so you would have seven fives seven times five is 35	sd	4.0

Did you already talk yet	eight times 34 because	sd	3.0
Why is it represented that way Emma	Its represented that way because you have 34 of one bag that has eight carrots	sd	4.0
Who can explain this a little more	Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	sd	4.0
Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here	Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	sd	4.0
Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times	Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	sd	4.0
Its like what we did in our journal pretty much	Well its not the opposite Im just saying its not 10 times 15 its like 15 of 10	sd	4.0
Kaya	Another way to really to visualize it is if youre thinking of one whole and one whole times itself so if youre multiplying one whole by 34 youre then getting 34 of the whole	sd	4.0

Do you see why its still multiplication	Yes	b	0.0
14 is two	It should be two times three	sd	3.0
Because 14 is two but you have 34	Then you got to times it with that	sd	3.0
But you have three of them so	Its six	sd	3.0
But you have three of them so you have	Twelve	sd	3.0
You got this	Yes	b	0.0
Whats 14 of eight	14 of eight would be four	sd	3.0

First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was	Then we have one whole leftover	sd	4.0
Then we have one whole leftover	We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	sd	4.0
We also have 13 we have 4 and 13	Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	sd	4.0
Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13	Then I got my answer 8 and 23	sd	4.0
Go again those of us that are  more time can look at it	First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction	sd	4.0
No I dont see how thats four whole groups	If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction	sd	4.0

I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12	I did find the numerator which was two	sd	4.0
Its not when an estimate  If you multiply 12 x 12 that would be putting an estimate way but theres another way	You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	sd	4.0
You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12	If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	sv	4.0
If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right	Youre only finding 25 of 12	sd	4.0

to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four	you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent	sd	4.0
Noelle	I think the algorithm is	sd	0.0

All right any residual questions on either of those factoring or finding intercepts	How did we make originally it was 10 so what do we do to make that 10	sd	2.0
Oh it is negative okay	When we were doing the example yesterday that we took notes on	sd	3.0
Right that was a different problem	Yes	b	0.0
It just so it happened that both of the C values had a 10	Both the axis have a three	sd	3.0

I dont know Id have to look at the likes toolkits you know	Five or six	sd	0.0
The next intercept theyre all synonyms roots zeros Xintercepts all mean the same thing	P and Q are technically just the Xintercepts	sd	3.0
Thats why they say Xintercepts P and Q	When you write the equation on the test if you wrote that one	sd	0.0
What would you have to do	You unfactor it	sd	3.0
Yes dont be long	I wont be long	sd	0.0
Coaches the answers are up here if you need to check them	Can you plug in the Xintercept if the	sd	3.0
Correct	What is this	sd	0.0
Walk me through what youve got here	Weve plugged in the vertex here to the  then we plugged in the second	sd	3.0
Theres the problem	Do you want to expand it	sd	0.0

Why cant you not do that	Because its connected to the A	sd	4.0
Because its connected to the A	Its part of the A right	sd	1.0
If its 4X plus 3 why cant you say thats 7X	Because	sd	0.0
When Im solving for X I go backwards so I do the adding or subtracting at first then multiplication or division part	Okay thank you	sd	0.0

What have we been calling it	Intercept form	sd	3.0
What did we discover about anything that has an even power	That it increases like that or its like that it bounces	sd	0.0
If you have any questions as you work through it let me know have good conversations with your partner work through them same place same time everybodys working together having good conversations	I actually have a question	sd	0.0
I actually have a question	When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	sd	3.0
When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing	how to do that	sd	2.0
So its a different	Its pretty much	sd	0.0
Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that	Okay	b	0.0
Okay	So its up to you	sv	3.0
So its up to you	Thanks	b	0.0
Thanks	Yes	b	0.0
Yes	I mean Ill work	sd	0.0
Match it first because then youre going to use the Xintercepts of the graph to write it in factor form	is exactly the intercept	sd	3.0
Yes so do any of these actually bounce off the Xaxis	No but this is	sd	3.0
Right but what we were talking about and let me put that back up for you	How do you put your factor in there	sv	2.0
is when I have a factor thats	When its a factor	sd	3.0
Yes	Isnt B over there	sd	3.0
Isnt B over there	Its rounded out	sd	3.0
Its rounded out	Its rounded out	sd	3.0
Its rounded out	Or theres like actually is figure out	sd	0.0
Well youre going to first match it with the graph	What Im trying to do is Im trying to figure out the intercepts and then I can match it	sd	3.0
But youre going to do the other way around today	But I dont like that	sd	0.0
So thats the sequence today	How do we find the factor	sd	2.0
How do we find the factor	Okay	b	0.0
Okay	So I know  quadratics	sd	0.0
So I know  quadratics	So anything other than	sd	0.0
So the direction of this would be similar to the direction of what	If they were	sd	0.0
If a line is going like that is this positive or negative	Positive	sd	3.0
Thats right	Okay	b	0.0
Then typically if theres one two three directions its a	Okay	b	0.0
Okay	How do you do the	qy	0.0
How do you do the	So which ones with that and ones with	sd	2.0
So which ones with that and ones with	Im going to come make a case	sd	0.0

Is there something thats distinct about those two	Both are negative	sd	3.0
You can probably use that ones going to be a little maybe a little quicker to figure out	All right	aa	0.0
All right	So C is	sd	3.0

ATFE Mr	Genius you should know this	sv	0.0
Dont forget that for this part you should be able to use your toolkit	Did you just  my seat down  leaning on it	sd	0.0
Did you just  my seat down  leaning on it	Yes so you dont end up on my feet	sd	0.0
Yes so you dont end up on my feet	Do you know how to do it	sd	0.0
Do you know how to do it	Yes I do	sd	0.0

How do you do it	That part you just get	sv	0.0
That part you just get	That works	sd	0.0
That works	But theyre just	sd	0.0

Yes you dont have to solve it	Im still doing it because Im still	sd	0.0
Its not a bad plan	You just subtract these	sd	3.0
You just subtract these	Oh wait	sd	0.0
Oh wait	You guys multiplied the fraction	sd	1.0
You guys multiplied the fraction	Oh because you subtract this	sv	3.0
Oh because you subtract this	Yes you subtract this	sv	1.0
Yes you subtract this	Five to the power of eight	sd	3.0
Five to the power of eight	Its 731	sd	3.0
Its 731	You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	sd	4.0
You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731	No wait	sd	0.0
No wait	You can actually solve for that	sd	3.0
You can actually solve for that	You could	sd	1.0
You could	So its actually 427	sd	3.0
So its actually 427	125 to the power of 23	sd	3.0
Yes you were supposed to be the genius	Come on	sd	0.0
Come on	So its eight to the power of two	sd	3.0
So its eight to the power of two	Its eight to the power of two 64	sd	4.0
Its eight to the power of two 64	Thats probably wrong	sd	1.0
So how can I use maybe this portion	I got mostly the right answers	sd	0.0

Did we get  48	I think so but I dont know	sd	1.0
That was a little bit easier	Whats the square root	sd	2.0
In your toolkit were going to add these perfect cubes	All right the math checks out	sd	3.0
All right the math checks out	Yes thats what Ive been saying	sd	1.0
Yes thats what Ive been saying	Only intelligent	sd	0.0
Now if I multiply by one am I changing my number	Not necessarily  its getting more specific in terms of	sd	0.0
If I take seven and multiply it times one its still seven right	Yes	b	0.0
Is it still seven	Yes	b	0.0
Yes so why are we finding some sort of one to multiply our problem by	To remove the radical from the denominators	sd	3.0
If we focus on what was chosen to multiply this by 8 is 2x2x2 right	Yes	b	0.0
Now the cube root of four	The cube root of four	sd	0.0
What did they end up choosing is going to be the form that we have there	Oh this is  says Its conjugate	sd	0.0
Were going to use the difference of two squares as the idea and as Santiago was saying we talk about it being a conjugate	Conjugation	sd	0.0
Notice in this case that my index is the same and my radicand is the same so what did they do here	Three	sd	3.0
Where did that one come from	Its an implied  factoring out a common	sd	3.0
Its an implied  factoring out a common	I think	sv	0.0
Then the question is why did they put an absolute value thing in there	Its not based on the principal root	sd	3.0
Whats a number that I can take the fourth root of	They can be negative and positive	sd	3.0
Yes if I say I take the fourth root of whats 2x2x2x2	Then you can have minus two and thats	sd	3.0
Then you can have minus two and thats	Plus or minus	sd	3.0
Explain what youre talking about Santiago	For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	sd	4.0
For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get	Yes am I not explaining enough	sd	0.0
Yes am I not explaining enough	For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	sd	4.0
For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16	When we are typically working with radicals we want to get the principal root which is the positive answer and the absolute bar value is there to strictly involve with principal root	sd	4.0

Friday the 13th	Okay so that means that were going to be after	sd	0.0
You dont need one of this	No	b	0.0
You cannot have a radical in the denominator position	How would you	qy	0.0
Questions on this one	Can we do another one	sd	0.0
Youre looking for fourpoint two the extra practice and anybody got the page number yet	One sixteen	sd	0.0
One thirteen	Fifteen	sd	0.0
So Im rationalizing	Number five	sd	3.0
Number five	Im going to just go  10x	sd	3.0
Ms SaundersThe area of it would be	You have that extra practice test	sd	0.0
You have that extra practice test	Yes	b	0.0
Yes	Yes	b	0.0
Youve got to look at four to get so youll do	Can I do it	sd	0.0
Itll be on my desk then	Okay thank you	sd	0.0
Guys weve got the level four for you to do	Area	sd	3.0
Area	Perimeter	sd	1.0
Perimeter	Perimeter	sd	1.0
Perimeter	Yes you want to do that	sd	1.0
Yes you want to do that	Yes I just didnt distribute the four	sd	1.0
Yes I just didnt distribute the four	I just got 40x	sd	3.0
We need to get you to level four	You could do that too but you still get 40x	sv	3.0
You could do that too but you still get 40x	Yes but then wouldnt you have to multiply that to the 14 power	sd	3.0
Did you finish the extra practice	I thought we only had Just kidding were not done at 215	sd	0.0
For this particular example whats our first step going to be David	Isolate the radical	sd	3.0
Whats step two Tobias	Get rid of the plus one	sd	3.0
Tobias	Dont you square it	sd	3.0
Simplifying this Id end up with x1 but then I have this	Its not going to go over	sd	3.0
Yes so have I simplified	No	b	0.0
In this case what do you think we should do Cordelia	Then we have to solve the resulting equation	sd	3.0
Were not quite there yet	Square it	sd	3.0
Square it	You raise each side of the equation to the same exponent so then youd square both sides	sd	3.0
Minus one yes so we end up with x equals	Three	sd	3.0
Whats the next step Nadia	Youre done	sd	3.0
Were good	No	b	0.0
Joel	You have to substitute the xy back into the	sd	3.0
When we add one to both sides will we have isolated the radical or are we done with that	Yes	b	0.0
Yes	Yes	b	1.0
To get x by itself here whats my two steps	Cube each side	b	3.0
Weve done that were left with this two step equation	Add nine to each side then divide by two	sd	3.0
Perfect now why did you say add nine as the first step instead of dividing by two first	Because otherwise you would still have the nine remaining	sd	4.0
What would 9 2 give me	Four point five	sd	3.0
Can you guys think what is the math reason that we use that says why we add nine first	Order of operations	sd	3.0
Yes you	I have a question about	sd	2.0
I have a question about	If you add 9 to either side youd be left with 36 then if you divide by 2 you get left with 18 but if you divide it by 2 and 27 then you get	sd	4.0
Yes yes you just simplify	Its not	sd	0.0
Its not	Its not so good	sd	3.0
First three problems on that extra piece of paper you got	Weve probably done the two on that	sd	3.0
Weve probably done the two on that	Is that  equations	sd	3.0
Isolate the radical	Isolated the radical	sd	0.0
Brittany we havent heard much from you so could you read the big paragraph	Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	sd	0.0
Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation	C solutions are called x solutions	sd	0.0
C solutions are called x solutions	When you use  you should always check each apparent solution in the original equation	sv	0.0
Could you read that attend to precision	Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	sd	0.0
Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced	Consider the equation  x3	sd	0.0
Consider the equation  x3	This equation has no real solution	sd	0.0
This equation has no real solution	However you obtain x9 after squaring each side	sd	0.0
Weve isolated the radical so step two then	Get rid of the radical	sd	3.0
A second power and we would end up with x29	Yes	b	0.0
Thats showing us that you dont always get the right answer in these problems and so were going to go through some of those	Technicallycould you just not check it and understand that if its equal to a negative then its not going to have a solution	sd	3.0
Brittany whats step number one	Isolate the radical	sd	3.0
Brittany	Yes	b	0.0
Square both sides	Now were getting spicy	sd	0.0
We have to distribute the	I still dont know the foil is	sd	0.0
Thats okay because foil is	Just one method of it	sd	3.0
What happened between here and here	I dont know	sd	0.0
Table method I think is a great way of organizing to multiply those	I agree	aa	0.0
Joel what are we going to do	Im gonna subtract the 1	sd	3.0
What are you thinking	You could subtract 7x and subtract 15 and just factor your brand new trinomial from there	sd	4.0
Equals zero	Establishing zero	sd	3.0
What would be left over here is an x2 combining these	A negative I guess	sd	3.0
Combining those	Minus 14	sd	3.0
Are there factors of negative 14 that add up to 7	Yes	b	0.0
We did solve for x	Oh I knew that	sd	0.0
Yes	If I remember it correctly but Im not sure  of the solutions could be correct	sd	3.0
Thankfully this side looks a whole lot less complex	Its really easy to do it	sd	0.0
There is an x and an x over here	You would just subtract in both sides	sd	3.0
Where are we going to put everything Tobias	I would first of all just subtract all the constants so I would subtract two and one in both sides	sd	3.0
Divide by two that gets rid of that	That gets you back to negative x and then you just square both sides and then it just gives you x2x2	sd	4.0
Brittany after we isolate the radical what do we do	Yes	b	0.0
Do I want to subtract all of this or subtract that	Subtract the x in the negative two	sd	3.0
Why would I prefer to move these over here instead of moving that over here	To keep the leading coefficient positive	sd	3.0
Are there factors of negative two that add up to negative one	Yes	b	0.0
They would be	Negative two or positive one	sd	3.0
In these cases if we have calculators which were not going to have the calculators on the test	Also these arent that hard	sd	0.0
Also these arent that hard	They are only basic equations	sd	3.0
They are only basic equations	Its not complex stuff	sd	0.0
That last one when we solved it even though there were a lot of steps to it there wasnt anything we couldnt do	going to make us graph that by hand	sd	0.0
Describe the translations from the parent function kind of thing	Are we going to have graphs on the level threes	sd	0.0
Im not making the test this time	Is the extraneous answer always going to be when x is negative	sd	3.0
I dont know well look for patterns and see	In looking for patterns it looks like whenever x is negative	sd	4.0
Whats the one answer that works	x2	b	3.0
Thats the one that worked	could have just waited for the question to be answered	sd	0.0
Thats okay	I have a question	sd	0.0
Yes	Whos making the test	sd	0.0
Brittany whats going to be our first step	Isolate the radical	sd	3.0
Yes were going to square both sides	when one is a cube root and one is a square root	sd	3.0
You dont want to do that when	Can we write these on the paper	sd	0.0
You got all of those	Yes	b	0.0
Have you checked your answers yet	Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	sd	4.0
Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself	Im good at math	sd	0.0
Joel did you all do the problem	Christian Branson can die	sd	0.0
Christian Branson can die	Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	sd	0.0
Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in	Im just having a moment right now	sd	0.0
Im just having a moment right now	Okay guys okay	sd	0.0
Vijay lets come back to your seat	I was helping Joel	sd	0.0
Whats step one for this type of problem because we just switched problems	What I would do is to make that into a radical and then write	sd	3.0
Or we could treat is as the fourth root to x cubed	Subtract two	sd	3.0
Subtract two	Isolate it	sd	3.0
The flippy thingy	Where are you making it into the radical	sd	3.0
What do we call that when we flip it	I dont know but you flip it	sd	0.0
Reciprocal	Yes reciprocal	sd	0.0
How do you want to think about eight to the fourthirds power	Would it be  fourth root of eight	sd	3.0
Would it be  fourth root of eight	You find the cube root of eight and thats two and then you multiply that by the other exponent	sd	4.0
We have our solution	That is ridiculously simple	sd	0.0
That is ridiculously simple	I have a question	sd	0.0
Yes	Its basically when youre doing the raise each sides of four thirds youre putting the power of the reciprocal of both sides	sd	3.0
What is isolated	The rational exponent so like that	sd	3.0
What are we going to raise both sides to	Two over one	sd	3.0
Typically you see if theres parentheses that use brackets but more parentheses is fine	would use the bigger parentheses	sd	3.0
Subtract the x over okay	Then you get 30 equals x	sd	3.0
Then what do I do	Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	sd	3.0
Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x	No because thats x squared	sd	1.0
If we subtract that then this whole thing is going to equal	Zero	sd	3.0
Are there factors of negative 30 that add up to negative 1	Oh yes	b	0.0
Joel when we have quadratic constant and linear terms what do we want to do	Factor it	sd	3.0
When we see we have those three different types of terms we want to set it equal to zero we factor so my two possible solutions here are going to be	Positive six and negative five	sd	3.0
Yes	Can we take a break	sd	0.0
Whats two to the third equal	Two times two times two	sd	3.0
Two times two times two equals	Eight	sd	3.0
Is that okay	Yes	b	0.0
Weve got to divide by three so we do that first	Equals four	aa	3.0
Add one and so were left with this expression that x can be any values that are less than or equal to 17	I think  does the inequality symbol ever switch because  divided by negative number you have to switch it	sd	4.0
X is in between what two numbers	1 and 17	sd	3.0
Sure is it already queued up or	No	b	0.0
No okay	Do exponents switch to inequality	sd	3.0
Tobias you better be nice to me	I will	sd	0.0
I will	Dont worry	sd	0.0
Dont worry	Im not going to bully you	sd	0.0
Im not going to bully you	Its just amazing	sd	0.0
I will need you right now to have your whiteboard and marker and the other thing that you will need today do you have a math spiral	Yes	b	0.0
Thats exciting isnt it	Yes	b	0.0
Go	Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a multiplication rule	sd	0.0
Bobby are you willing to	Yes	b	0.0
Tell us	It is saying you find denominators and multiply them but we are not multiplying the denominator but multiplying fractions	sd	3.0
Say it	Numerator	sd	3.0
Go	I know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions	sd	0.0
Will you share your thinking that I heard you talk about	I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	sd	4.0
I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths	If youre adding on another eighths that would be five eighths and one and five eighths is really close to four eighths and its one eighth away from a half and its three eighths away from the whole	sd	4.0
Will you remind me your name please	Im Jenny	sd	0.0
Jenny	I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	sd	4.0
I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up	Since youre adding to one half you would round this up to one whole	sd	4.0
Jenny will you call on someone else to add on to what you were thinking	Virginia	sd	0.0
Virginia	I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	sd	2.0
I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole	You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	sd	4.0
You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it	So youre having to round it up to one whole	sd	4.0
So youre having to round it up to one whole	Youre going to round it back onto one half because of the middle more	sd	4.0
Julie	We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	sd	4.0
We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds	So if you are rounding it it would almost be a whole minus a whole which we thought would be whole zero	sd	4.0
Thank you	I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	sd	4.0
I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one	When you have one tenth it would be just a little less than one hundredth than one	sd	4.0
Eliza would you call on someone else to share their thinking	Julie	sd	0.0
Julie	I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	sd	2.0
I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it	Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	sd	4.0
Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred	Thats over a whole which we decided will be closer to a whole	sd	4.0
Is that better	Yes	b	0.0
All four of the fourths	What color	sd	0.0
Theyre yellow	Yellow fourths	sd	0.0
Tell us about your thinking Robin	First I split the circle into fifths and then I shaded in pink the three fifths and then I shaded it orange the one fifth too	sd	4.0
So you shaded in three of them and then one of them and your total is	Four fifths	aa	3.0
Go	So what I did is I took one half and  a fourth  so then I drew it and I came up  and then I connected another one	sd	4.0
How many fourths make up a half	Two	sd	3.0
Can I have you guys please turn your eyes and ears this way over to Noah	I did a number line strategy and	sd	3.0
There we go	What I did I did two number lines	sd	4.0
What I did I did two number lines	One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	sd	4.0
One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way	So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer	sd	4.0
He said he converted one half to	Three fourths	sd	3.0
that	like to add	sd	0.0
like to add	add the root of the equivalent is equal	sd	3.0
add the root of the equivalent is equal	So thats not	ba	0.0
did you want to add on	Oh I couldnt	sd	0.0
Go	You said	sd	0.0
So 14 and 13 is looks like this	Yes thats	ba	0.0
Yes thats	I knew	sd	0.0
My friends would you please turn your chairs turn your body so that you can see the front screen	What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	sd	4.0
What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12	So I added 14 and 13	sd	4.0
So I added 14 and 13	So 14 is equivalent to 312 and because it was equivalent to 312 and then 13 was equivalent to 412 I did 312 plus 412 is 712	sd	4.0
Three green pieces 13 one orange piece is equivalent to	412	b	3.0
We are starting with 14 plus 13 is that right Julie	A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	sd	4.0
A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third	So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	sd	4.0
So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this	It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	sd	4.0
It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before	So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	sd	4.0
So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent	So I did the same thing	sd	4.0
So I did the same thing	You have to do the same thing	sd	4.0
You have to do the same thing	1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	sd	4.0
1  4  4 and then 1  3  3	So now it will be 412  312	sd	4.0
So now it will be 412  312	Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	sd	4.0
Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators	So four plus three would be seven	sd	4.0
So four plus three would be seven	That will be 712	sd	4.0
Youre using the multiplication strategy to help you get common denominators	Uhhuh	b	0.0
The multiplication strategy gets you two equivalent fractions so that then you can add the numerators	Yes	b	0.0
Yes	For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	sd	3.0
For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves	Thats what it is like	sd	0.0
Thats what it is like	So thats what I did to	sd	0.0
So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator	Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator	sd	4.0
times say it Katie	One fourth	sd	3.0

Alice	You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	sd	4.0
You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three	Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	sd	4.0
Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two	So then two times three is six	sd	4.0
So then two times three is six	So then your new fraction is 36	sd	4.0
Are you making that number bigger by multiplying it by one	No	b	0.0

Would you call you on someone else please to continue our conversation	Sofia	aa	0.0
Sofia	Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	sd	3.0
Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times	I might  more except that I think that it may be how much of a fifth would go into 15	sv	1.0
How would you prove this is right	and five times three equals 15	sd	4.0
Jayden would you start as our first teacher to share how did you think about what is one fifth of 15	First I drew  which is 15	sd	4.0
First I drew  which is 15	Each row here is one fifth  is also three and the whole represents 15	sd	4.0
Jayden call on someone	You have something Brendan	sd	0.0
You have something Brendan	He explained it very well	sd	1.0
Was your thinking similar	It was my thinking was similar	sd	1.0
It was my thinking was similar	Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	sd	1.0
Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths	I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	sd	4.0
I know if you multiply five by three you get 15	So that will be 15 fifths	sd	4.0
So that will be 15 fifths	Then if you break that into a mixed number it will just be three wholes	sd	4.0
Hey Ryan tell us about your thinking	So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths	sd	4.0
So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths	I did that because you said one fifth of 15	sd	4.0
I did that because you said one fifth of 15	So I made this	sd	4.0
So I made this	Then I knew five times three equal 15	sd	4.0
Then I knew five times three equal 15	So I did three on each my fifths	sd	4.0
When you said you did you wrote three on each fifth because	Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	sd	4.0
Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15	So I wrote threes to represent my answer	sd	4.0
Call on someone	Because he knew that three times five is 15	sd	1.0
Everybody say thank you Ryan	Thank you Ryan	sd	0.0
So fifth graders I want you to be thinking about look at how there were several different ways to solve one fifth of 15	There was five one fifth and  five times three equals 15	sd	4.0
The connection to multiplication is	Five times three equals 15	sd	4.0
Everybody say were proud of you Avery	Were proud of you Avery	sd	0.0
I forgot who else I called	Liam	b	0.0
I said its right but how did you get it	Five times three equals 15 and automatically that one fifth of 15 is three	sd	4.0
So knowing the connection between multiplication what would you say the connection is between multiplication and unit fraction of problems	So lets say like this part is	sd	0.0
You can use that green marker you can use any expo marker	So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	sv	4.0
So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that	Then so this  you divide up here	sd	4.0

Brendan will you share with us your thinking here on number three	On number three	sd	0.0
How did you start	I started with looking at the first two which showed kind of Actually I first looked at what the rule was	sd	3.0
The rule is 23 thats not a unit fraction so what was your step	My step first was to find the unit fraction of each of the numbers and then multiply that by two	sd	4.0
So whats onethird of nine Brendan	Three	sd	3.0
One third of nine is three and then we multiply	By two	sd	3.0
So how did that help you here on the 12	I did and then you put the same thing find out 13 of 12 is 4 so then 4  2 is 8	sd	4.0
Yes my dear	On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	sd	3.0
On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait	No	b	0.0
No	Oh yes 3 2 is 6 so then I would have to do 2  2 and I know thats 4	sd	4.0
So my friends if you have finished numbers three and four please move on to five and six but Miss Kay and I are coming around to check number four	Im done	sd	0.0
Then you may move on to five and six	That would be seven and six	sd	0.0
That would be seven and six	Four times six	sd	3.0

Quarter turn	Half turn	ba	1.0
Say it out loud	Half turn	ba	3.0
Would you stand up for us so we can hear you	I thought it was a quarter turn based on the rotation of how far the angle was and the reason why I think it is a quarter turn is because if you look it looks like its not a full half turn based on how long it is	sd	4.0
My friends remember our sentence starters on the whiteboard	Alyssa	b	0.0
Alyssa	I think its a halfturn because if you look at the shape of it if you do that shape again I think its a whole square and I think that would be a whole	sv	4.0

What did we just do	Quarter turn	sd	3.0
Say your answer out loud	Full turn	aa	3.0
Bryce	I said it was a whole turn because if you look at the very bottom of it it shows a whole circle	sd	4.0

What did you guys get	We got 90 to 180	sd	3.0
Lets do the next one	I think its a zero between 90	sd	3.0
Talk to your team and tell your friends why	Because its less than like a 90degree turn	sd	4.0

It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned	It looks like its more than 90 degrees	sd	4.0
It looks like its more than 90 degrees	Its more than a hundred degrees	sd	4.0
They might agree disagree addon	I agree because the arrow is pointing to the right so its not turning all the way	sd	1.0
How do we know this angle is less than 180 degrees	I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	sd	4.0
I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction	Its not facing it and its higher so its not going to be that	sd	4.0
Got it	The  it makes its not one side to the other side	sd	3.0
So 180 degrees would mean this line would be straight across	Yes	b	0.0
So we know its less than 180	Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	sv	4.0
Yes then it has to be this one because its more than	Also	sd	0.0
So 180 degrees would be this line all the way across right here	Its bigger than that and	sd	3.0

Do you agree with Matthew that its less than 90	Yes	b	1.0
Youre showing why	I think it would be zero through	sd	3.0
Do you see how Logan drew in where the 90 degrees is	Angle BOX is less than 90 degrees	sd	3.0
