Is it Cassie	Mmm hmm	0.0
Mmm hmm	We were looking at the circumference and area of the circle and the difference	3.0
Angelique	Yeah	0.0
Okay	We talked about the area is length times width and perimeter is length plus width plus length plus width	3.0
Youre telling me how to get it so youre saying well what shape are you talking about	a triangle	3.0
a triangle	I mean  I mean the rectangle	3.0
Alexander	Well the area is whats inside and the perimeter is whats outside	3.0
Can you guys see what Alex is doing	Yeah	0.0
Whats your name	Joey	0.0
What Julian is doing	Hes getting the perimeter of the circle	3.0
What did Alex do	Alex he shaded in the middle of the square  cause its the area	1.0
Stacey	He outlined the circle with the perimeter	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Are you all as awake as I am	Yeah	0.0
Did you all build the same model	No	0.0
To answer that question	No no	0.0
Erik	Some of us built the same models and some of us built different	3.0
Do you remember	Oh	0.0
Erik	Could you get different answers	3.0
Could you get different answers	Using barred models	1.0
Using barred models	if you use different models	3.0
Maybe not huh Michael have you been thinking about that a little  bit	Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that we  got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth because it  will always take two it will always take four quarters to equal up	4.0
Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that we  got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth because it  will always take two it will always take four quarters to equal up	Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it by two	4.0
Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it by two	In half	1.0
In half	So there will always be one fourth and two fourths three fourths  four fourths and two fourths is always going to be a half halfway  point	4.0
What are you why  are you smiling about Mark	Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	0.0
Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	I made the sea monster  bigger than the boat	3.0
Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat	No	0.0
What about the boat and the children	Those too	0.0
Those too	The children are bigger	3.0
No	Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of just the  boat	1.0
Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of just the  boat	Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look bigger like  youre looking at the children not the boat	1.0
I I	like he doesnt he just put the boat in	1.0
Yeah	Cause theyre at the dock	1.0
Cause theyre at the dock	Yeah but he wasnt just focusing on the  boat	1.0
Mark	Uh the boats the biggest	3.0
Do you agree	Mm hmm	1.0
okay	And then the children um and then the fish	3.0
You all agree with that	Um hmm	1.0
Meredith	Well maybe not because everybody cant have the same because  they dont have theyre not like copying each other	4.0
some of you might use little dolls or  something right or bigger dolls or	You re not measuring the same	3.0
And if somebody came in now with a fish bigger than the boy   that would have missed the point right	No because a fish could be bigger than a boy	4.0
Would it look different	Yes	0.0
Would the relationships that youre suppose to show change	No	0.0
No	It would look like a shrimp	3.0
Graham	Well it wouldnt fit	3.0
And what would happen  Meredith	Well you could put the Audras fish and you could put Danielles fish  into Audras box because it s small and it could fit in	4.0
It could be a shrimp	but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small	4.0
So in this case if if your one is going to be the size of this  little stage if you like  your players are made the boy the  girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it	Mm hmm	0.0
Isnt that  right	Yup	0.0
Would you expect it to work if your	Maybe maybe	0.0
So tell me what  you re thinking	Well your old model say your old model you decided it was too  little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	4.0
Well your old model say your old model you decided it was too  little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	So you make a bigger  model and you try to take the little fish from that model because you  decide that you dont want to make another one you put it in and you  wouldnt be able to see it there	4.0
Right	Yeah mmm hmm	0.0
Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a different  model that her fish was smaller than the people and smaller than the  boat	Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish	3.0
But should those relationships hold	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
Yeah is that right	Yeah	0.0
Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he were  trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be smaller than  the people than the boat	Yeah	0.0
So in each of your models would have those relationships holding  right	Yeah	0.0
But they wouldnt all be built the same way and they wouldnt all be  the same size	So it d be its standard that the fish would be smaller than the boat  and the people except the fish would be different sized and the  people different sized and the boat different sized	4.0
Is that like what youre doing when you make models to  compare fractions	Yeah	0.0
Meredith	Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right then  youre going to wind up with the same answer and some of the  models could be bigger and some of them could be smaller	4.0
Michael do you want to add to that	Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller than the  people and the people have to be smaller than the boat cause the  people have to go in the boat and the people have to be able to pull  the fish out of the water and if it was bigger than it they might have a  little trouble getting it out	4.0
Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller than the  people and the people have to be smaller than the boat cause the  people have to go in the boat and the people have to be able to pull  the fish out of the water and if it was bigger than it they might have a  little trouble getting it out	So um so then um its sort of  like so that just helps us understand what we re talking about with  the Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to make  different sized um halves and quarters um but they re basically  you can call it the same thing as you would then just the small one  with the small one if you call the box a whole and the boat a half it  would equal a quarter	4.0
So um so then um its sort of  like so that just helps us understand what we re talking about with  the Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to make  different sized um halves and quarters um but they re basically  you can call it the same thing as you would then just the small one  with the small one if you call the box a whole and the boat a half it  would equal a quarter	You could still do that in Audras model or  any box	4.0
Oh it was said already	Yes	0.0
Why don t you work with your partner and see what you can  do	Try the purples	0.0
Try the purples	Get three purples	0.0
Get three purples	It doesn t work try the greens	0.0
It doesn t work try the greens	What was it	0.0
What was it	Two thirds	2.0
Two thirds	It would be like brown or something like that	3.0
It would be like brown or something like that	Ok	0.0
Ok	We re not doing the one third we re doing two thirds	0.0
We re not doing the one third we re doing two thirds	That is one  third	0.0
That is one  third	First we ve got to find out what a third of it is	3.0
First we ve got to find out what a third of it is	What s a third of an  orange	2.0
What s a third of an  orange	One third	0.0
One third	What s third of an orange	2.0
What s third of an orange	Let s start a different model	0.0
Let s start a different model	The green	0.0
The green	The green half of it is the  light green	0.0
The green half of it is the  light green	Alright yeah I was thinking of that way before	0.0
Alright yeah I was thinking of that way before	And you can take the take the red and the light green and put it up  to it  it s she asked is one half bigger than  what did she ask	0.0
And you can take the take the red and the light green and put it up  to it  it s she asked is one half bigger than  what did she ask	What did she ask	0.0
What did she ask	She asked which is bigger one half or two thirds	0.0
She asked which is bigger one half or two thirds	One half or two thirds	0.0
One half or two thirds	Now take six of the ones	3.0
Now take six of the ones	Yeah I know and put  em up to there and that would be one sixth	3.0
Yeah I know and put  em up to there and that would be one sixth	Hey wait a minute hey wait maybe that s it yeah it s bigger by one  sixth	3.0
Which is bigger	One half	3.0
One half	I think one half is	1.0
Yes David and Meredith	What do you have	1.0
What do you have	Well	0.0
Well	we think	0.0
we think	two thirds	3.0
two thirds	is bigger than	1.0
You both agree	one half by one sixth	3.0
one half by one sixth	Cause if you put six ones up to a whole	4.0
Cause if you put six ones up to a whole	dark green	0.0
dark green	If you put it up to a whole	3.0
I m sorry what s the number name for dark green	One	3.0
Ok	And you put six ones up to the dark green	3.0
What are you calling these	One sixth	3.0
One sixth	And then these this would be	0.0
And then these this would be	We re calling them each sixths	3.0
Ok	So there s six sixths	3.0
So there s six sixths	This would be one third and this is one half of  dark green and then it would be bigger by one sixth because	4.0
Do you both agree with that	Yeah mm hmm	1.0
And see if you can make me  if it works for  other models because some students don t believe that it works for  other models and I think you two believe that it works for other  models	Mmm hmm yeah	0.0
That if it works if you really believe it  that if it works for one it works for others and then write this up let  me get you some paper	Seven nine ten I need them	3.0
Seven nine ten I need them	Go get another box	0.0
Ok I see you had your hands up  over here	Yeah	0.0
Let me come around and see what you re doing	We found two answers	0.0
We found two answers	Well I have three	1.0
Here which one do you want to tell me about	That one	0.0
Yeah thats an interesting looking one tell me about it	Now if you call this rod one	3.0
The orange and red together	Yeah and you take the two dark green rods those are the halves	4.0
Yeah and you take the two dark green rods those are the halves	And you take two  thirds and put it up to it and you take two sixths its bigger than  two sixths	4.0
And you take two  thirds and put it up to it and you take two sixths its bigger than  two sixths	And  in this one it you take this	4.0
Can we go back to that one again	I mean its bigger than one tenth I mean twelfth one twelfth one  twelfth	4.0
I m confused about  the little white rods I am following you right up to that point	If you put the white rods up to here theres twelve of them and  then you call them twelfths because there are twelve of them	4.0
All right okay	And then you take the two thirds and you take two twelfths and  then you put it up to the thirds and it is bigger by  two tens two twelfths	4.0
By two twelfths okay	If you use this model	3.0
Uh hmm	And if you use this model	3.0
Uh hmm	And you call these sixths and you put  this one up to it and it is bigger than one  sixth	4.0
Okay so here it was bigger by two twelfths and here it was bigger  by one sixth	Yeah	0.0
Could we call the difference between the two  thirds and the one half in this model another number name besides two twelfths	Um yeah well maybe	0.0
You said two of those little white ones were two twelfths right	Yeah and maybe since two of these little white ones equals up to  one of these	4.0
Yeah and maybe since two of these little white ones equals up to  one of these	or its one fifth oh I mean one sixth the reds	4.0
Oh thats interesting thats kind of interesting then so if you then  used the reds to describe the difference you could call this one sixth  the difference	Uh hmm	0.0
one of the whites you say is one sixth	Yeah	0.0
Why don t you work with your partner and see if you can  figure it out	Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we have the  three thirds and we then the half	3.0
And what we supposed to figure out after we did that	Which is bigger a half or two thirds	2.0
Is it still the same or does it change when your  model changes	Two thirds is still bigger	3.0
How  many do you think	Eighteen	3.0
So how much larger	It s bigger	3.0
It s bigger	One eighteenth	3.0
My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over there	It was bigger by one one sixth	3.0
This is  different from the other one or the same	It s different in a way and it s the same in a way	4.0
How s it different and how s it the same	Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s different  because um this one it only ta the little box are only um two three  four there s only six of them and here s there s eighteen and this  the thirds are bigger by three eighteenths	4.0
You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three eighteenths	and the two thirds over here is bigger by one sixth	4.0
I agree with you  you re saying that two thirds is still bigger but it it bigger by a  different thing	Well	0.0
Ok Danielle what do you think about this time	Well um two thirds	3.0
Can you build a two thirds and a one half for  him separate so we can then compare	Here s the two thirds and here s the half	3.0
What s the difference	and it s bigger by two twelfths	4.0
and it s bigger by two twelfths	It s  um it s bigger by two twelfths	4.0
How are the answers I don t understand what do you think  about this	One two three	0.0
Over here it was how much	This one was bigger by three eighteenths	4.0
And this one	Was bigger by  how much	2.0
Was bigger by  how much	Two twelfths	3.0
Two twelfths	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve	0.0
And your original one was	It was bigger by one sixth	4.0
Oh so what do you think	I think they re all different but then all the same	4.0
I think they re all different but then all the same	Cause they re the  same because the thirds are always bigger than the half	4.0
The two thirds are always bigger than the half	And um and they re different because these are all the whites	4.0
And um and they re different because these are all the whites	they re different sizes	1.0
they re different sizes	They re all different like one two uh three they re different	4.0
They re all different like one two uh three they re different	So  they re different like that	4.0
Or this difference  here	You could use a light green	0.0
What would that be	That would be one That would be one sixth	3.0
And what did you say it was over here with the little one	Um that s one sixth	3.0
So if you used the light green	It could be one sixth	3.0
And if you used the whites	It would be three eighteenths	3.0
What about for this one	What problem	0.0
Uh Gregory I want you to watch and see if you agree with  what Danielle is doing here	And then  that would be one sixth too	3.0
Mmm over each of  em	That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that one would  be one sixth	3.0
But you have had two two different names for the answer if you did  it this way it was	It was two twelfths	3.0
And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had the  three what was the name for that one	Three eighteenths	3.0
Alright so tell me which is bigger	Two thirds	3.0
Again	Two thirds	3.0
How many of you are  convinced you know how much bigger and no one can persuade you  otherwise that two thirds is not only bigger than a half but it is how  much bigger	One sixth	3.0
How many of you made a second  model	Oh Oh	0.0
Amy	Ah the orange and red	3.0
Did you get to have two thirds bigger than a  half	No	0.0
You didn t  Michael	No they cant do that	1.0
No they cant do that	Because um the the two  thirds are bigger than the half by a red	4.0
Because um the the two  thirds are bigger than the half by a red	So they cant use those whites  to show it	4.0
Oh but youre saying that youre saying that two thirds whats a  third	A third is the purple	3.0
Just tell us	Um two thirds is two purples	3.0
And what did you get to be one half	Uh dark green	3.0
And you got two thirds to be bigger  than one half	Yes	0.0
By how much	By one sixth	3.0
By one sixth	Or or two twelfths	1.0
Or or two twelfths	No	1.0
What color rod	Red	3.0
And what did  you get Meredith	Two twelfths	3.0
What do you think about that	Well in a way	1.0
Well in a way	No	1.0
No	Uh uh	1.0
Well she showed its bigger by the two whites she shows two  whites bigger	Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together one  sixth	1.0
Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together one  sixth	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	1.0
Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	Yeah she said	1.0
Shes calling one white one sixth	No Im not Im calling it one twelfth	3.0
Shes calling one white one twelfth	Yeah but see just the whites together	0.0
Yeah but see just the whites together	Thatd be right it would be  two twelfths	3.0
Thatd be right it would be  two twelfths	But you have to combine them	3.0
But you have to combine them	You cant call them  you can call them separately but you could also call them combined  and if you combine them it would be uh one sixth	4.0
Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two whites  together again Meredith	One twelfth two twelfths	3.0
And two white rods would be	Two twelfths	3.0
And one red would be	One sixth	3.0
So so what is Meredith saying here	Theres two answers	3.0
Are there two answers	No theyre the same answer	1.0
No theyre the same answer	No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red and  divided it into half she divided it into halves into half and called  and called each half one twelfth	4.0
No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red and  divided it into half she divided it into halves into half and called  and called each half one twelfth	Theyre the exact same answer  except theyre just in two parts	3.0
Well give it the number name what did you say	One sixth	3.0
And two whites can I write two  w   for  two whites	Yeah	0.0
And youre calling two whites	Two twelfths	3.0
But what Erik just told me right  is something about red and white	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	A red one red equals one red rod up here one red equals two  of the white ones	4.0
Do you all agree to that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
Yes	And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other white  rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	4.0
And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other white  rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	But when she  calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are actually just two white  rods put together to equal a red so it should be really its really one  sixth	4.0
But when she  calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are actually just two white  rods put together to equal a red so it should be really its really one  sixth	Because two whites two whites	4.0
She says one white is a twelfth and then if you put it together  with another one twelfth shes saying you get two twelfths	And its one sixth its one sixth	1.0
Is that what you are saying	Yeah	0.0
All those things are they true	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But I dont really think you could call call them two twelfths  because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size as one sixth	4.0
But I dont really think you could call call them two twelfths  because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size as one sixth	Well if you want to you could call them I guess	0.0
Well if you want to you could call them I guess	But I think it  would be easier just to call them one sixth then wouldnt want to  exactly call them one twelfth and another twelfth	4.0
But I think it  would be easier just to call them one sixth then wouldnt want to  exactly call them one twelfth and another twelfth	Id just call them  one sixth	4.0
Id just call them  one sixth	Therefore I think you just really call them one sixth	4.0
Therefore I think you just really call them one sixth	Well maybe you can call them	0.0
Well maybe you can call them	Well you can call them if you want to but	0.0
Well we have different number names for these rods	they re not different	0.0
they re not different	Theres just half of one theres just half of one	3.0
So youre saying that one half of the one sixth is another way of  saying one twelfth	Theyre just two answers	0.0
Isnt that  what you said	What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would be the  exact same thing	4.0
So are all of these true  statements	Yeah	0.0
So  Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with you when I say  that its a red bigger in this model  right	Um hmm	0.0
would you read it	Situation 5 is  This test was very difficult for most people	0.0
Ok and can you tell us why your group feels good about that match	Our group felt that it was pretty good match because when it says its most difficult and then we checked it the highest score is mostly in the lowest score while little bit to no people got the highest score of 90 or 100 percent	4.0
I cant see it	According to me its approximately 42 people got a 20 to 30 percent score	3.0
Fabulous can you read for us please	Some people got low scores but most people but some people could do everything	3.0
Could do	Everything	0.0
What made you guys write that for histogram F	Uh like like some people got like low scores and like there was like some people got like everything right	3.0
How many people got everything right	Like one or two	3.0
do you want to rebuttal	What I was thinking that it doesnt work because its little to no people not because some people might be like more than because its real   its more real to have 100 percent on histogram F while the lowest scores from 20 to 30 theres a bunch of people that has a low score	4.0
Um  do you want to rebut him	I think that	0.0
Even though  is up here	I think that the situation you gave fits more to histogram A because um histogram A shows no people getting scores of 70 to 80 or higher and so that means that everybody got a very low sco or a low score whereas in um histogram F a few people got a score that was 70 to 80 80 to 90 90 to 100	4.0
So are you saying that your group took s group number 5 situation and put it with A	Yes	0.0
If youre a black card Id like for you to share first	12 so yeah okay	3.0
12 so yeah okay	This ones wrong and I think	3.0
This ones wrong and I think	and the rest make sense	3.0
and the rest make sense	this ones wrong but these two make sense	3.0
this ones wrong but these two make sense	So then does that make sense	3.0
So then does that make sense	Because 18 18 18 18 18	4.0
Because 18 18 18 18 18	And this one makes sense because it says 3 dollars per month so then thered be 369121518 21 24	4.0
And this one makes sense because it says 3 dollars per month so then thered be 369121518 21 24	Then the Online Flix is wrong because its supposed to be 12	4.0
Then the Online Flix is wrong because its supposed to be 12	Yeah its supposed to be 12 plus 1 for 1 rental	4.0
Yeah its supposed to be 12 plus 1 for 1 rental	So 12 13 14 15 16	0.0
So 12 13 14 15 16	And then right here it says 12 25 38	4.0
Lets start with Kyle	I think it does make mathematical sense because with 12 if you add 13 to that its 25 and if you add 14 to 25 its 38 and 38 plus 15 is 51 and so on	4.0
Um Debra	It does well it does make mathematical sense but it doesnt follow the plan	3.0
So could you tell me which one does make mathematical sense and does follow the plan and which one or ones dont follow	Movie Busters and Mail Flix follow the plan and Online Flix doesnt	3.0
Would you like to add to that Victoria	Um actually theres a problem with it  cause it says number of movies zero	4.0
Um actually theres a problem with it  cause it says number of movies zero	And it says Online Flix and Mail Flix 18 and 12	4.0
And it says Online Flix and Mail Flix 18 and 12	But youre really not paying for anything right now so why should you pay that much now without without any movies right now	4.0
Or about 0	About the 0	3.0
Okay do you want to talk about 0 then	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I think that it does make sense because the 12 the Online Flix you have to pay 12 per month and so that would be you would havent rent no movies but you still have to pay for the month on each one	4.0
Okay so if we rented 0 movies from Online Flix youre saying we would still have to pay the 12	Yeah	0.0
Okay even though I dont have anything	Yeah	0.0
Jocelyn	Um it doesnt really make sense because like Movie Busters see how all the way down it adds 3	4.0
Uh huh	Well on Online Flix when we were having our partner talking we were looking at the 0 how it added 3 and how 18 added nothing it stayed	4.0
Well on Online Flix when we were having our partner talking we were looking at the 0 how it added 3 and how 18 added nothing it stayed	Well 12 plus 12 isnt 25	4.0
Well 12 plus 12 isnt 25	And so on	4.0
Hailey	Well like for Online Flix for each movie like 13 and 14 and so on and so on like Online Flix it says uh those like other numbers	4.0
Well like for Online Flix for each movie like 13 and 14 and so on and so on like Online Flix it says uh those like other numbers	but if you take 13 and add it to 12 you get 25	4.0
but if you take 13 and add it to 12 you get 25	And then from 25 if you add like 13 more dont you get 38	4.0
Yes	And it keeps going	3.0
So then were adding by what here Hailey	13	3.0
Danielle	12 plus 12 equals 24 but if you buy one movie it equals 25	4.0
So the two flat fees of 12 plus the 1 makes the 25	Yes	0.0
Jessica	I think it does make mathematical sense because they all match the plan	4.0
Amir	I think it does make mathematical sense but I think theres something that I dont see really correctly	4.0
I think it does make mathematical sense but I think theres something that I dont see really correctly	So 12 plus 12 equals 24	4.0
So 12 plus 12 equals 24	But why are we adding 1 to it	2.0
Lisa	Because you pay 1 per movie	4.0
Go ahead and talk to your shoulder partner please for a quick moment	Ya vi que este no no esta  bien	3.0
Ya vi que este no no esta  bien	No esta  bien	3.0
No esta  bien	Porque este esta  cobrando mas que tiene que cobrar	4.0
Porque este esta  cobrando mas que tiene que cobrar	Si no fueran aqui fueron 24	4.0
Si no fueran aqui fueron 24	Oh si	1.0
Katie	Because its showing you that with with On with Online Flix and Mail Flix you still have to pay the monthly fee even though youre not buying any movies	4.0
Hailey	Like even though like it says for either one of them that you have to pay a fee and youre still paying it but on Movie Busters if you dont get anything youre not gonna have a fee to pay	4.0
Okay	So it goes by what you rent	3.0
Jessica	You would get I think I would get rid of the 0	4.0
You would get I think I would get rid of the 0	Cause its kind of confusing	4.0
Cause its kind of confusing	And then start off with 13	4.0
And then start off with 13	Instead of 12	4.0
Instead of 12	So they dont think that 12 plus 12 is 24	4.0
So they dont think that 12 plus 12 is 24	So I would get rid of the 0	4.0
Kyle	You could tell them that you dont have to pay the first fee for every rental you just have to pay 1	3.0
Okay so if you were to help them figure out that this was not 25 what would you tell them	Uh that you dont pay the flat fee for every rental you just pay 1	3.0
So what would it cost for 1 movie from Online Flix	13	3.0
And how did you get your 13	Because 12 plus 1 is 13	4.0
Erin	Well because then you could compare the prices and eventually meet up with one of them for the prices which is 18	4.0
Charles	Well if like out of those they can be even Id first look at Mail Flix because if thats always 18 that means that youre gonna need to look for 18 matching so Id go down to the other ones and look  til they had 18	4.0
So Jessica are you gonna make any changes to Student As work	Im gonna shift all the numbers downwards so I can get rid of the 0	4.0
So we want to	Isnt that kind of like a ripoff	0.0
Amir what changes have you made for Student A	No changes	3.0
Why not	Cause I think they should keep the 0  cause maybe the Student A would want to go to rent a DVD and they would find out that every month a DVD would be 12 um dollars for the Online Flix and	4.0
So if you rent 1 movie how much money is that gonna cost you	Uh 25	3.0
Uh 25	Oh	0.0
Oh	But if you wanna rent a movie and one month	0.0
So how much will 1 movie cost you all together	Um 25 bucks	3.0
So whats that going to be	I dont understand	2.0
So you pay 12 plus the 1	Oh	0.0
Oh	13	3.0
So for then 2 DVDs how much are you gonna spend	Umfor 2 DVDs 13	3.0
So thats 12 plus 2	12 plus 2 equals 14	4.0
And what about 3 DVDs	12 plus 3	3.0
Which would be how much money	Uh 16 I mean 15 dollars	3.0
So do you need to make some changes	Yes I do	0.0
Task 1 is 15  210	It says is one fifth equal to two tenths	0.0
What do  you remember about that Meredith	Um	0.0
You want to tell us	We had used our Cuisenaire Rods	0.0
Because Dr Davis also wasn t here	Say this is called one	4.0
Say this is called one	Then you   took this	4.0
Then you   took this	This would be half of  the orange rod    and this would be um	4.0
This would be half of  the orange rod    and this would be um	called the one   and these would be  one  and these would be called the two  halves	4.0
Ok so what name would you give the yellow rod	A half	3.0
Ok	And this would be called one	3.0
Is one fifth equal to two tenths	Um	0.0
Um	Two tenths	3.0
Two tenths	You call this two tenth	3.0
You call this two tenth	This is usually a tenth   and then you put this  up and you call this two tenth  and then you take this and you put it  up to them   and it s  five they equal up to it	4.0
But maybe if you can tell the class what your thinking let s  see what they think	Well if you have the orange rod and you put it up to the yellow rod  the yellow rods it s two halves and that would be called two tenths	4.0
Well if you have the orange rod and you put it up to the yellow rod  the yellow rods it s two halves and that would be called two tenths	Uh yeah	0.0
Uh yeah	Two tenths  wait two tenths would be	4.0
Two tenths  wait two tenths would be	two ones     That is what two tenths  would be  because these ones are tenths	4.0
Why don t you tell the class and	These ones are tenths   cause this orange  rod is one and when you put the ones up to it there s ten of them and  two of them would equal two tenths	4.0
These ones are tenths   cause this orange  rod is one and when you put the ones up to it there s ten of them and  two of them would equal two tenths	And this  is one fifth to the orange rod	4.0
And this  is one fifth to the orange rod	And if you take one of them  it s equal to two tenths	4.0
So what is your conclusion if I ask you the question is two tenths  equal to one fifth	Yes	0.0
Do you agree or are you not sure	I agree	1.0
Ok you want to explain why you agree	Well I agree because it s just like having one of these reds being a  whole and one of these  being a half	4.0
Well I agree because it s just like having one of these reds being a  whole and one of these  being a half	So it s just like  saying it s just like saying two halves equal a whole	4.0
So it s just like  saying it s just like saying two halves equal a whole	It s the same  as being two tenths equal one fifth	4.0
Erik do you want to do  you want to say what you think out to Brian	Well I kind of agree with Meredith because if you take the orange  rod it takes ten of the white rods to equal up to the orange and five  of the red ones	4.0
Well I kind of agree with Meredith because if you take the orange  rod it takes ten of the white rods to equal up to the orange and five  of the red ones	Then if you take two of these   which is two tenths and this  is one fifth	4.0
Then if you take two of these   which is two tenths and this  is one fifth	Because well it s  it takes five of them to equal up to the orange rod and and if you put  two tenths next to it they equal up to each other and you ll have one  fifth and one tenth and two tenths together and they both equal up to  the same amount	4.0
Because well it s  it takes five of them to equal up to the orange rod and and if you put  two tenths next to it they equal up to each other and you ll have one  fifth and one tenth and two tenths together and they both equal up to  the same amount	Like what I said kind of	1.0
Ok Jackie	Um well we thought it was six twelfths because	3.0
Jackie I am sorry I cant hear its so loud here	Um we thought is was um six twelfths because there are um twelve  pieces in all and she got six and six makes half	4.0
What do you think	I have another one	0.0
That another number name  you said Jackie was	Six	3.0
Danielle	Um I thought um it would be um two fourths	3.0
How did you think that	Because if she got a half then the top two rows um is a half and  then that s two fourths	4.0
Danielle thinks  that another number name for how much of the candy bar we gave  Dr Martino is two fourths so we re interested in knowing how  Danielle was thinking about that	Well this row and this row is a half   and then these are two fourths	3.0
Can you help the class understand that	Because there s four rows	4.0
Brian	I just found out another way that a half can be	0.0
Brian	If I agree	1.0
If I agree	Ok	0.0
Ok	Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	4.0
Well I agree on two fourths because there s because three  times because four times three equals twelve and if you split it in  half there d be three fourths	Well  well I agree because there are four thirds on there but but when  there s a half there are only there s three fourths instead of four  thirds	4.0
Where are your four thirds	Well well well when you said   to split it in half   like that there are only two fourths left over  yeah there are only two fourths when it s a whole there are four  thirds   I can t explain it too well	3.0
Danielle do you want to go up there and	No I just have something to say	0.0
No I just have something to say	Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	4.0
Cause If there s four fourths  um and half of four is two so two fourths would be a half	But I thought about it the other way around	1.0
What do you mean by the other way around um Brian	Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	4.0
Well instead of well she went two fourths like going across like  cause those are fourths and that s a fourth and there are two of them	I have another way	1.0
I have another way	It s I have three I think three sixths	3.0
Three sixths	Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	4.0
Because well because a whole there s a whole if there s  yeah it s three sixths	Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	4.0
Because  there are six of them there there there I found groups of sixths	There s one sixth another sixth another sixth another sixth another  sixth another sixth and if you split them in half there s three of  them on top	4.0
So he is saying that  these two little pieces of candy and these two and these two and  these two and these two and these two I don t know if that is what  you said Brian but something like that	Yeah	0.0
Brian	We did two fourths	3.0
Nice and loud	We did two fourths	3.0
Jessica	No I was going to say one half	3.0
Danielle	There are six twelfths	3.0
We said six twelfths two fourths we  said one half Brian	Three sixths	3.0
The two whites together	Two tenths	3.0
Michael	One fifth	3.0
And what other number name can I  call the red one	Two tenths	3.0
Michael	We were working on the candy bar problem	0.0
We were working on the candy bar problem	Like with like which  is bigger a half or one third and we were using candy bars to show  that	3.0
Andrew	Yeah we were working on we had to write about um and we had to  do an example on it and um to see if which is bigger one half or one  third	3.0
Laura	One half	3.0
And see if you can convince us of  your result	Well um one third would be just this piece here  and one half of that would be  and one half would be this  and one third  is bigger than one half cause this  would be one third and  then this bigger piece  would be one half of that	4.0
Well um one third would be just this piece here  and one half of that would be  and one half would be this  and one third  is bigger than one half cause this  would be one third and  then this bigger piece  would be one half of that	And	0.0
Can you tell me what number name you re calling the orange and the  red rod	Um one	3.0
Can you say that again  what number names gave to each of those rods so I can hear from  back here	You say	0.0
You say	Um this would be this we re  counting this as one whole  and I think this   has two and this  has wait um	3.0
Um this would be this we re  counting this as one whole  and I think this   has two and this  has wait um	Um   um I can t we called it yeah  I think  this one was one	3.0
Um   um I can t we called it yeah  I think  this one was one	That was one third	1.0
That was one third	this was one third and this was one half	1.0
this was one third and this was one half	One half	1.0
Audra what do  you think of what  the two young ladies built up there	I agree because	1.0
Want to speak to the class	I agree because if you saw what the um half  was here and then you saw what no what the half was here and then  you saw what the third was there and you saw that the half was  bigger than the third	4.0
Ok did you figure out  how much bigger	It s two two	3.0
It s two two	It s a red bigger but	3.0
Ok you re saying it s a red rod bigger or two white ones but that s  what I see you have built there but I would like you to tell me what  number name you have for how much bigger it is	Um wait it s one third bigger I think	3.0
Um wait it s one third bigger I think	I think it s one third bigger too because if you put the red to the  green	1.0
I think it s one third bigger too because if you put the red to the  green	You d see that there s three	1.0
You d see that there s three	You need three and if you put the purple one to it also and then it  takes one third of them	4.0
What do you think do you agree with this	Um yes	0.0
You agree with them	Well if you have um a red if you hold um well if you have um  well we used these and we went like and then we like held reds up  and we showed that um that um one half is bigger by because this  part is smaller and this is supposed to be one one third so that s  how we did it	4.0
Do you agree with  them	Not really	1.0
Oh hmm	If you take this and it has three thirds	3.0
And you re calling this one third	And we re calling this	0.0
And you re calling this one third	One third	0.0
And you re saying one half  is bigger than one third by one third	Yeah you can put three of these three reds up to one green  and then it would take one one third of the red to make um to go  there like	4.0
Brian what do  you think	Well when they said one third is bigger than one half by one third	1.0
Well when they said one third is bigger than one half by one third	I  think they said is that what they said	1.0
I  think they said is that what they said	Well I don t really agree  because well if you split if you split one of the thirds in half which  would make  which would make a sixth	4.0
Well I don t really agree  because well if you split if you split one of the thirds in half which  would make  which would make a sixth	I  think it s a sixth bigger	4.0
I  think it s a sixth bigger	Like well  um should I go  up there	0.0
Maybe you  need to have a little conference here we have some disagreement	Well see for um when they said it was  one half bigger if you split a third in half itd make a sixth like one  two three four five six	4.0
Well see for um when they said it was  one half bigger if you split a third in half itd make a sixth like one  two three four five six	Like like pretending they were like  pretending they were split in half	4.0
Like like pretending they were like  pretending they were split in half	If you split one of these in half  and you have three of them up there they d make they d make six  and any way and when you split them in half right in the middle  over there it s kind of like that it s kind of like this there was this  was that was the one third  and that was the  one half  on the bottom and so it s just  like this and the red I m pretending is like is like is a half of one of  the purples and you see when I split it in half it s it s one sixth and  and it equals and it equals up to a green	4.0
I m hearing you say Brian that the number name for red is one sixth  and the reason why is	Well I mean a red I m considering a red one sixth   because two of these  equals see they re two they re two  sixths two halves of one purple and the purple is a third and the half  of one third is sixth there s sixths	4.0
That s my question	Well what I mean is	0.0
So we have two different arguments at the table and it s  very important that you listen so you understand what the arguments  are	Kelly and Jackie have something else that like goes with this like	0.0
But I would  like you all to listen to these arguments	Well we would call this dark green one and the reds one third and  the light green one half and we thought the we thought one third  was bigger by one of these white things	4.0
Well we would call this dark green one and the reds one third and  the light green one half and we thought the we thought one third  was bigger by one of these white things	Oh I think they re making a different size candy bar	3.0
Is that allowed	Um no	0.0
In what way it is not fair	Because if say you give someone half of this one	4.0
Because if say you give someone half of this one	and then  one half of that one	4.0
and then  one half of that one	and this is bigger than	4.0
What did you call one if you re thinking of  candy bars when you began the problem	The dark green	3.0
Is that what you said	Yeah	0.0
Ok then use the okay if your calling dark green one then I want to  hear your argument which is bigger a half or a third and by how  much	Okay we think that a half is bigger than the third	3.0
Did you change your mind	Yeah and we think light green is a half	3.0
Well show me your argument now and tell me which is bigger a half  and a third and by how much	Okay this is this is a half  and the red is a third	3.0
Can you show me why that s a half	Because if you put these all together they equal up to the  one  and we think the light green which is a half is  bigger than the red by by one which is this white one	4.0
I thought I heard you say it s one bigger	Yeah	0.0
Did you say that	Yeah the green the light green is one bigger than the red	3.0
Yeah the green the light green is one bigger than the red	And the  red is one bigger the light green is one bigger	3.0
And what number name are you calling the white	One	3.0
You all agree with that	Actually I used this to um to tell that the light green is one white  bigger	1.0
Ok and the number name you are giving to the white you re saying  is one	Yeah	0.0
you called the green one and your calling the white one	No	0.0
So your calling this one and this one	I think I know what they mean	1.0
Erik what do they mean I m so confused	I think they mean that they want to call this  the dark green one one whole and they want to call this yeah like  you line all the whites up to it which I think should be six and they  want to call it one sixth	1.0
I think they mean that they want to call this  the dark green one one whole and they want to call this yeah like  you line all the whites up to it which I think should be six and they  want to call it one sixth	I think that s what they re trying to say but  they just they re just not saying it	1.0
I think that s what they re trying to say but  they just they re just not saying it	I think they just they want to  call it one sixth	1.0
I don t see six of them up there	Well however many are up there that what they are trying to say	1.0
Well however many are up there that what they are trying to say	Yeah because I think they meant	1.0
Yeah because I think they meant	I think you meant to say not one whole but one sixth	1.0
Is that what you meant to say	Yeah	0.0
One half is how much bigger than one third	Um one one sixth	3.0
Is it one or one sixth	One sixth	3.0
You re sure it s one sixth	Yea	0.0
Why can t it one	Because that s be um the dark green	4.0
I understand when	But I think you can call it one because you can make the dark green  bigger	4.0
But they didn t they called the dark green one Erik	You could call you can call the dark green one six the  dark green rod six and then you could call the light green rod three	3.0
But can you do that in the same problem	No	0.0
Isn t that what you said	This is one whole and then this is one third and this is one half	3.0
Now if you really  understood what mistake you made here maybe you ll figure out  what mistake you made up there	Well we and we um named well three reds equal up to um one  greens and then you put the purple next to it and you need one more  red you need a red to go next to the purple so it would be one third	4.0
I am so confused	I don t I still don t think so well because well well see like I said  before when you split the ahh when you split the thirds in half and  they make sixths it s still like	4.0
Someone has to	See well because when you put it right there you see that you see  that there s one of these if you put one of these on top of it you  might see that that it s that much that that red that red is that much  bigger than one of the halves because one of these reds I m calling  is is is a sixth and anyway a half of one of these a half of one of the  thirds	4.0
See well because when you put it right there you see that you see  that there s one of these if you put one of these on top of it you  might see that that it s that much that that red that red is that much  bigger than one of the halves because one of these reds I m calling  is is is a sixth and anyway a half of one of these a half of one of the  thirds	But when you put it on top of one of the thirds it s that much  bigger than one of the halves	4.0
But when you put it on top of one of the thirds it s that much  bigger than one of the halves	Well I think they might both be answers	1.0
How many of you disagree	I don t think you can have an answer of a third because if you have  one half   and if you take the one half  which would be the dark green you have the one half and then these   are the thirds	4.0
I don t think you can have an answer of a third because if you have  one half   and if you take the one half  which would be the dark green you have the one half and then these   are the thirds	How could one half be bigger than the  thirds by one third	4.0
How could one half be bigger than the  thirds by one third	Because and you have the half and the thirds  together that the half is almost as big as two thirds but yet the two  thirds arent exactly are not exactly the green the dark green is not  the dark green is not exactly as big as two two thirds but two thirds  it s the but it s far enough so that the two thirds are not bigger than  it by one third	4.0
Because and you have the half and the thirds  together that the half is almost as big as two thirds but yet the two  thirds arent exactly are not exactly the green the dark green is not  the dark green is not exactly as big as two two thirds but two thirds  it s the but it s far enough so that the two thirds are not bigger than  it by one third	I kind of agree with Erik	1.0
I kind of agree with Erik	I think now I disagree with them	1.0
I think now I disagree with them	I don t really think that if you have this  that you could  have one third bigger than it  because it s got to be one  third and probably a third and a half	4.0
I don t really think that if you have this  that you could  have one third bigger than it  because it s got to be one  third and probably a third and a half	Yeah he s right	1.0
Yeah he s right	It couldn t be it couldn t be exactly a third	1.0
It couldn t be it couldn t be exactly a third	Cause one third bigger this would be one third bigger like that to the  end over there	4.0
Cause one third bigger this would be one third bigger like that to the  end over there	That would actually be like this  this would really be one third bigger  and there s still some left over and there s still about	4.0
That would actually be like this  this would really be one third bigger  and there s still some left over and there s still about	A half left over	1.0
A half left over	Yeah there s still there s still one more there s still one more piece  left like about a sixth left	1.0
Yeah there s still there s still one more there s still one more piece  left like about a sixth left	Cause it s like if you have if you have the like dark green and it  doesn t exactly equal up to it doesn t exactly equal up	4.0
Cause it s like if you have if you have the like dark green and it  doesn t exactly equal up to it doesn t exactly equal up	It s less than  two thirds but it s more than one third	4.0
It s less than  two thirds but it s more than one third	It s just about one third and a  half	4.0
It s just about one third and a  half	So it couldn t be exactly a third bigger than it and it couldn t  be exactly two thirds or it couldn t be exactly one third bigger	4.0
So it couldn t be exactly a third bigger than it and it couldn t  be exactly two thirds or it couldn t be exactly one third bigger	It  had to be one third and a half	3.0
Michael wanted to say something for a long time and has been very  patient	Umm I think it should be called one sixth because  because if you put six reds up to one orange  with a red then it would  equal there would be there would be it would be the same size just  so it would be called one sixth because reds like that	4.0
Umm I think it should be called one sixth because  because if you put six reds up to one orange  with a red then it would  equal there would be there would be it would be the same size just  so it would be called one sixth because reds like that	Yeah I agree with Michael and Erik	1.0
You thought about the red as being one sixth  to make a half of a third and Michael is saying that red is one sixth	Yeah Michael is right because it takes three sixths to equal one half  and if	4.0
I see Meredith is wanting to say something	I agree with Erik Michael and Brian because if you do call that a  sixth a sixth and if you put the dark green and two thirds you said  it was you said it was um they said that it s a third bigger if you  did a third bigger this is called a third and then you put it there you  see negative	4.0
I m sorry Meredith could you start again	You said it was one third bigger that can t be true because one third  bigger	4.0
You said it was one third bigger that can t be true because one third  bigger	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It s about one sixth less	4.0
It s about one sixth less	So it can t be a third bigger	4.0
So it can t be a third bigger	And also like	0.0
And also like	So it s one sixth bigger	1.0
So it s one sixth bigger	And also yeah and also I think because if you have the light green  the light green it s not bigger than it s not bigger than the it s not  bigger than the umm third it s not bigger than two thirds	4.0
And also yeah and also I think because if you have the light green  the light green it s not bigger than it s not bigger than the it s not  bigger than the umm third it s not bigger than two thirds	It s bigger  than one third but it s not as big as two thirds so it s less than two  thirds but more than one third	4.0
It s bigger  than one third but it s not as big as two thirds so it s less than two  thirds but more than one third	So it can t be a third bigger	4.0
So it can t be a third bigger	And if  you have that to make it two thirds large there has to be a sixth	4.0
Well that is really something uh I think	It s sort of like one sixth in both cases	3.0
What do you think	Which red rods	0.0
Which red rods	These little ones	3.0
What do you think	No	0.0
No	Look	0.0
Look	Nope	0.0
Nope	You d have to fit more here	3.0
You d have to fit more here	There is enough to fit another light  green in here	3.0
Danielle what do you think	No	0.0
Can you speak nice and loud Danielle	Put the two red ones next to the yellow one	3.0
And	And there s more space	3.0
Okay someone told me that the  purple rod	This one	0.0
Is half as long as the black rod	No	0.0
What do you think	No	1.0
No	Nope	1.0
The black rod	Oh the black rod	0.0
Oh the black rod	It would take another light green to make a whole and that s not  half	4.0
It would take another light green to make a whole and that s not  half	Yeah it is look	1.0
Yeah it is look	That is not as long as the black it would take another light green  one	3.0
That is not as long as the black it would take another light green  one	Oh	0.0
David	No	0.0
David doesn t believe it why not David	Because if you put the two on top	3.0
Nice and loud David	Cause if you put the two purple if you put the two purples on top  of each other they ll be taller than the black	4.0
What do you think	Yep	1.0
Yep	Yep	1.0
Yep	Mmmhmm	0.0
Mmmhmm	Mmmhmm	0.0
Mmmhmm	Cause two of these would make	4.0
Discuss it with your partner	Yeah I think so	0.0
Yeah I think so	Umm cause if you did it like this	3.0
Someone told me Jackie	Yeah	0.0
That s lovely thank you  Jackie	One third	3.0
Nice and loud Beth	One third	3.0
Can you tell me why you  would give it the number name one third	Because if you put three of them it makes one whole	4.0
What do you think	It s right right right	1.0
It s right right right	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	It s right	1.0
It s right	Mmmhmm	1.0
Mmmhmm	Yep one third	1.0
What do you think Jessica	It is	1.0
And how would you convince me Jessica	Because you could if you have you have three of these you could  put it up to the blue and it s one whole	4.0
So if I call the blue rod one what number name would I give to light  green everybody	One third	3.0
Now notice if I called  the dark green rod one what number name would I give to the red	One third	4.0
So are the number names always the same	No	0.0
Am I ever going to  call this something else other than blue	No oh yeah	0.0
What am I going to call it	Dark blue	3.0
I  mean the color names	Color names no	0.0
Right do we agree  that the color names are always the same	Mmmhmm	0.0
Do the number names change	Yes	0.0
Erik	You could think you could say that you could take an orange block  and a blue block and that would be that would be three three  thirds of it	4.0
You could think you could say that you could take an orange block  and a blue block and that would be that would be three three  thirds of it	Wait no	3.0
Wait no	Wait hold on	3.0
Wait hold on	Well no I mean if you take if  you take a blue rod and you could call it one whole then you would  take a diff a smaller rod and that would be something	4.0
Which one	Um well oh you take a light green and that ll be a third of it	3.0
How is that possible for both of these to be a third	Oh oh I know	0.0
Michael	Because there is a different size whole	4.0
So do we have permanent number names	No	0.0
Do the color names change	No	0.0
And we re calling this one light green  why don t you make sure you pull out all of them and see if it is true  that there are ten of them and see if we can come up with the  different color names and then we ll do some problems with  number names	Six  Seven so far seven eight nine	0.0
Six  Seven so far seven eight nine	I got nine but where is the ten	2.0
I got nine but where is the ten	Let s get them in lengths	0.0
Let s get them in lengths	Eight nine ten there we go I got them	0.0
Nice and loud Kelly	I put the tallest then the  second to tallest third	3.0
Which is the longest rod	Um the orange	3.0
The orange do all agree	Mmmhmm	1.0
And then tell me what to do	And then I put down the blue	3.0
Blue	Then the brown	3.0
Brown	Then the black	3.0
I can t find the brown brown	Then black then dark green then yellow then like the pinkishred	3.0
We call this purple	Purple	0.0
Okay	Um light green then red and white	3.0
Michael	One third	3.0
Okay and why Michael one more time	Because it would take three of the red ones to make um one of  the green ones	4.0
And  we said that you told me this is a third is that possible or is it not  possible can you try to convince me that it s not possible for the  red one to have the number name one	Oh I can convince you that it s possible	0.0
Michael	It s possible because there s white and two whites equal one red	4.0
You told me one third	Yeah	0.0
I  am calling the dark green one	No	0.0
No	Not now	0.0
What is the difference Erik	Not if the dark green is one	4.0
Not if the dark green is one	Because if youre comparing the red to  dark green it cant be one	4.0
Because if youre comparing the red to  dark green it cant be one	But if youre comparing the red to  something else it can be a one it can be a whole	4.0
But if youre comparing the red to  something else it can be a one it can be a whole	But if you are  comparing it to something bigger though	0.0
Michael what do you think	Well red can t be a whole red can t be one because the green is  bigger and it takes three of the reds to make one green	4.0
You want to talk about it with your partner for a minute	Three wholes	3.0
Three wholes	Can t give it a name because it can t be put into into two	3.0
Can t give it a name because it can t be put into into two	Because  look	0.0
Because  look	But the dark green is bigger then that	3.0
Okay suppose I want the red to be one what number name would I  have to give dark green for red to be one	Three wh three wholes	3.0
Three wh three wholes	Because if this is a one	3.0
What Erik	It would be three wholes	4.0
It would be three wholes	Because if this is a one	4.0
Right	It takes three to figure this out	3.0
It takes three to figure this out	And if all the reds are one	3.0
So dark green would have to be three	And there are three that ll be three wholes	3.0
Do you agree Alan	Umm	0.0
Does that make sense Alan	Umm yes I guess so	0.0
Okay	Three wholes	3.0
Okay are you ready to argue that Erik	Yeah	0.0
Okay Alan	Three wholes	3.0
Nice and loud Alan	Three wholes	3.0
Are you all hearing what  Alan says	I know	0.0
I know	I know why	0.0
I know why	Okay because the the	0.0
Ah you need to talk much louder	Okay if the red one is considered one  then the green one is a lot bigger	4.0
Okay if the red one is considered one  then the green one is a lot bigger	So it would have to  be it would take three whole ones to make another green so it  should be considered three wholes	4.0
So it would have to  be it would take three whole ones to make another green so it  should be considered three wholes	Well I think well if you if you say that this would be one	4.0
Well I think well if you if you say that this would be one	This is one and it takes three  of the one the one wholes to equal up one of these	4.0
This is one and it takes three  of the one the one wholes to equal up one of these	And it that s one whole umm one  whole plus one whole plus one whole would equal three wholes	4.0
And it that s one whole umm one  whole plus one whole plus one whole would equal three wholes	So  the green would have to be three wholes	4.0
What do you think David	Well I thought the same thing because the dark green wait	4.0
Well I thought the same thing because the dark green wait	If red  is one that would be one whole	4.0
If red  is one that would be one whole	Then the green would have to be  ah two more wholes so that would be three wholes	4.0
I can t Joanna  could you Danielle	Fourths	3.0
Nice and loud	Fourths	3.0
And what would  you do to convince me	Well I put the four blocks up to the brown	3.0
Jacquelyn	Four	3.0
Why would you call it four	Cause this is one  and if you line them all up  like that and you add them all up it would be four wholes	4.0
Okay Laura	The red	3.0
What would you  do Graham to convince me	You would take a white rod and stick it right on the end of a red  one	3.0
Make up a problem	Two yellows	3.0
Just one problem you and your partner make together	No let s make it harder	0.0
See if you can trick me or trick Amy	Yeah look at this	0.0
And if if if you and your  partner may have made up or your partners have made a problem  when you think you have one be careful how you re gonna ask it  practice how you re gonna ask the problem and then raise your  hand	Hm hm hm hm	0.0
Hm hm hm hm	No that s one fifth	3.0
No that s one fifth	I know	0.0
I know	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	We re out of reds	0.0
We re out of reds	We re out of reds	0.0
We re out of reds	Oh well	0.0
Try to get a hard one and try to stump us	Yes I got it	0.0
Yes I got it	No those won t make it	1.0
No those won t make it	What makes thirds	2.0
What makes thirds	Thirds thirds out of a thirds out of this	1.0
Thirds thirds out of a thirds out of this	Probably the greens	3.0
Probably the greens	Light green	1.0
Light green	Light green would make thirds out of the orange	4.0
Light green would make thirds out of the orange	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	No it wouldn t	1.0
No it wouldn t	Yeah it would	1.0
Yeah it would	No it doesn t	1.0
No it doesn t	Try it	0.0
Try it	Then what does	2.0
Then what does	I know what makes thirds	0.0
I know what makes thirds	What	2.0
What	There s got to be one	0.0
Oh this is an interesting one	Which one makes thirds	2.0
Which one makes thirds	What makes	0.0
This would be an interesting problem what would you ask  me here Alan	If if the red rod was considered one fifth what	3.0
Or if the orange rod is considered if the red rod is one fifth what  would the orange rod be	Mmmhmm	0.0
Okay good problem	No but what makes it	2.0
No but what makes it	Nothing can divide twelve into thirds except	3.0
Nothing can divide twelve into thirds except	Red	1.0
Red	No	1.0
No	Two  four six eight ten	4.0
Two  four six eight ten	Ten divided into thirds	4.0
Ten divided into thirds	No ten can t be divided  into thirds	4.0
No ten can t be divided  into thirds	But nine can	1.0
But nine can	Nine can but there is no nine rod	1.0
Nine can but there is no nine rod	Oh yeah there is	0.0
Oh yeah there is	Eleven this is twelve though	3.0
Eleven this is twelve though	No it isn t look	1.0
No it isn t look	Two four six eight ten	4.0
Two four six eight ten	The orange rod is ten	4.0
The orange rod is ten	Okay ten	1.0
Okay ten	So that s ten this must be nine	4.0
So that s ten this must be nine	And this divided into thirds must be	3.0
And this divided into thirds must be	It takes green	3.0
It takes green	Light green	1.0
Light green	It takes green to divided the orange into thirds	4.0
It takes green to divided the orange into thirds	Blue	1.0
Blue	No we are doing this one	0.0
No we are doing this one	I m doing this one the one I made up	0.0
I m doing this one the one I made up	I m doing this one	0.0
I m doing this one	Yeah	0.0
Im ready to hear some questions because you can maybe  keep thinking of more	I got one	3.0
Are you all ready to listen to the questions	Oh mine is hard	0.0
And hopefully well get around	No one will get mine	0.0
Alan you want to come up here  and ask us and build it again	If one red rod was considered one fifth what would a whole be  considered	2.0
That s really a hard question	If the red rod would be one fifth what would one what would one  be	2.0
If the red rod would be one fifth what would one what would one  be	Me	0.0
If the red rod was one fifth what would we call one	The orange rod	3.0
The orange rod	Mmmhmm	1.0
Nice and loud Erik	No he called on Graham	0.0
No he called on Graham	The orange rod	3.0
Oh Graham	The orange rod	3.0
Can you prove it	Five red ones make up an orange rod	4.0
And Mark has one  right after that so why dont you come up too Mark and you can  both ask together and help each other find them	If the if the green was a whole what would a blue be	2.0
That was  the question	Erik	0.0
Erik	Three wholes	3.0
Nice and loud Erik	Three wholes	3.0
I think we don t have enough light green	Oh I have some light greens	0.0
Can you imagine it	Transparent	0.0
Yeah	Transparent ones	0.0
Laura	I built it on my desk	0.0
Ah because Mark has another one to ask  you go ahead Mark	If if the blue was one whole what would the green be considered	2.0
Light green right	Yes	0.0
Yes	One third	3.0
Why	Because umm these if the if you an put them up to the side  there ll be three and you put a one and it ll be one third	4.0
A hard  one	Oh I have a hard one	0.0
Uh oh a hard one	If the white one was one whole what would um the orange be	2.0
If we call the white rod one what number name would we give to  the orange	Erik	0.0
Erik	Ten wholes or ten	3.0
And and how would you how would you convince me	Well if you took the orange block you d and you took white ones  you d need just only ten well	4.0
You understand the question if I m calling  the orange rod one what number name would I give to the white  rod	Oh I know it I know it	0.0
Oh I know it I know it	I know it I know it	0.0
Okay Jacquelyn you tell us	One tenth	3.0
Jacquelyn	Because if you line them up on the side and add them all up it will  be ten	4.0
So if you add up one tenth up how many times would you be  adding one tenth	Ten times	3.0
Okay wow what a what a smart class	I have a hard one	0.0
We only have a few minutes	If you if I called purple is this purple	0.0
If you if I called purple is this purple	If I called purple a half if I  called the purple a half what would a whole be	2.0
Okay if purple were one half what would one be	Umm a brown	3.0
Youre really getting to know  these	I would take I took I tried it and I took a purple and tried to match  up all the rods up to the purple and then I took another one cause  the brown  the look the brown looked half the purple looked half  the other brown so I took another purple and it was a whole	4.0
I would like you to take a turn to  make a problem that will challenge your partner	I made a problem	0.0
And ask your partner that problem	You don t know mine	0.0
So we  are gonna come and listen to you	You just don t know the problem I just made up	0.0
You just don t know the problem I just made up	You don t  know the problem I made up	0.0
You you can actually just do it with the rods but  you have to make up a problem for your partner and with the  rods and your partner will make one up for you and then  after you ve done that successfully I d like you to try this is  called  try to stump your partner	I know what mine is	0.0
Are you experimenting	Yeah	0.0
Okay let us know when you ve got a problem	I have a problem already	0.0
I have a problem already	I have a problem	0.0
I have a problem	I have a  problem remember it	0.0
I have a  problem remember it	If a light green um no no	0.0
If a light green um no no	I have one for you	0.0
I have one for you	I have one for you too	0.0
I have one for you too	I have a  problem	0.0
You going to give it to Alan	I have a problem and Alan has a problem too	0.0
I want to hear these	If a light green was one third what would be a whole	2.0
What would be what	If a light green was one third what would be a whole	2.0
One what would one be	What would one be	2.0
What would one be	A blue	3.0
A blue	Yep	1.0
Looks like you were doing it in your heads	I could do it	0.0
Doing it in your head	This was the problem I was going to give out on the  overhead	0.0
This was the problem I was going to give out on the  overhead	There  that would if you look down it would equal up to a blue	4.0
Let s see	Like this	0.0
So it takes three of them	Now I ve got one for you	0.0
Let s hear Alan s	If the white one was considered one fifth what would be  considered one	2.0
If the white one was considered one fifth what would be  considered one	What	0.0
What	If this was one fifth	2.0
It s a good one	What would be one	2.0
What would be one	Yellow	3.0
Yellow	Right	1.0
Are you going to let him get off that easily	He knows it anyway	0.0
He knows it anyway	One two	0.0
Just in case you couldn t remember it in your head you  should always be able to go back and prove it	Umm and also I did I just counted up five	0.0
Oh	And I know that that s half of   and I know that yellow is half of orange which is ten	4.0
So you re using  Oh I m sorry	That s okay	0.0
That s very clever	Should we think of another problem and do it	0.0
Yeah why not	Ok lets see	0.0
I have one for you	Okay	0.0
Which rod would one be	That s two	3.0
That s two	Then one would be red	3.0
Then one would be red	Umm	0.0
Okay why	Well you see if that s two  this would be a half of it and half of two is one	4.0
Umm	And you take another one	0.0
And you take another one	I have one  for you Alan	0.0
Okay go ahead	If this is three  what is six	2.0
If this is three  what is six	If this  is three what is six	2.0
If this  is three what is six	If that little thing is three what is six	1.0
If that little thing is three what is six	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	This	0.0
This	This	0.0
This	No	0.0
No	No if that if that if that	0.0
No if that if that if that	If this is three what is six	2.0
If this is three what is six	If that was considered	0.0
If that was considered	Hold on I ve got to check	0.0
Hold on I ve got to check	Three of something	3.0
Three of something	Oh whoops you were right	1.0
Oh whoops you were right	Sorry sorry	0.0
Sorry sorry	All right now	0.0
All right now	I was thinking it was that	0.0
I was thinking it was that	Let me bump you off with one	0.0
Let me bump you off with one	Like you can	0.0
Like you can	If this  would be considered wait close  your eyes okay if this was consider one half what would be  one	2.0
If this  would be considered wait close  your eyes okay if this was consider one half what would be  one	Probably what is that purple	3.0
Probably what is that purple	A brown	3.0
A brown	Yep I knew it	0.0
Anyway do you know why youre here	No	0.0
No	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	About the towers	0.0
Milin	Yeah about the towers	0.0
Yeah about the towers	Were going to talk about this	0.0
You know the tower problem	Yes I do	0.0
Yeah the last one in class you did remember what that was  about	Robin Hood	0.0
Robin Hood	That was the last one we did	0.0
That was the last one we did	The towers of 5	0.0
The towers of 5	The towers of 5	0.0
And do you remember what you did with  those towers of 5	Yeah	0.0
What was the problem	How many  to make 5	3.0
How many  to make 5	how many towers you could make	1.0
how many towers you could make	Different towers you can have	1.0
Different towers you can have	Different towers you could make from 5 blocks up	1.0
Any 5 blocks	No	0.0
No	It had to be 2 colors	3.0
Okay and did you figure that out	Yeah	0.0
And what is it do you remember	32	3.0
You sure of it	Yes	0.0
How could you be so sure	Because we all ready checked	0.0
How could you be so sure	Remember we did all those the the charts the thingys for   and all those different  patterns	3.0
Remember we did all those the the charts the thingys for   and all those different  patterns	Remember I convinced you up in the the  watchamacallit	0.0
Yes in the room	I dont feel like convincing you again	0.0
Okay but I  remember saying to you Jeff and I remember saying to you Michelle and to you Stephanie and Stephanie did try to  work on towers of 6 And I asked all of you	So did I	0.0
If you were building towers of 6 how many  would there be	I didnt do it	0.0
I didnt do it	I I did some but I didnt	0.0
But do you know how many	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Probably 64	3.0
Why do you think 64	Well because there was a pattern	4.0
Whats that	You just times them by 2 and then	3.0
Times what by 2	The towers by 2 because 1 is 2 and then you figure out 2 is 2  and then I mean 4	4.0
The towers by 2 because 1 is 2 and then you figure out 2 is 2  and then I mean 4	And then	0.0
And then	See if you only had 1 block	3.0
See if you only had 1 block	Youre not making much sense	1.0
See Jeff okay okay	If you have 1 block and 2 colors then you would have 2  towers and we figured out that the other day that you keep  on adding 2	4.0
If you have 1 block and 2 colors then you would have 2  towers and we figured out that the other day that you keep  on adding 2	You you like 2 times 2 would be 4 and then the 3	4.0
So 4 would be for what	Four for there there would be 4 towers for 2 high	4.0
Okay	Its always opposite though	3.0
Okay but let me let me hear what Michelle has to say	And then for the 3 high then you would have 8 towers	4.0
And then for the 3 high then you would have 8 towers	And  then for 4 high you would have 12 towers	4.0
And  then for 4 high you would have 12 towers	And we kept on  doing it like that	0.0
Do you agree with that	I dont know what youre talking about	2.0
I dont know what youre talking about	Well what it is is	0.0
Lets lets stop here	And then for 5 towers itd be 25 then	3.0
And then for 5 towers itd be 25 then	And then	0.0
Go go ahead Michelle	If you had one high saying theres red and blue	4.0
If you had one high saying theres red and blue	Then you  would have 2	4.0
Then you  would have 2	And then if you had	0.0
Do you know what shes talking about	Theres one red and theres one blue	3.0
Theres one red and theres one blue	So you theres only  one way to do it so its 2	3.0
One way to do it so its 2	Yeah see if if you have to make towers of one and theres  only two colors	3.0
Yeah see if if you have to make towers of one and theres  only two colors	Itd be 2	3.0
Itd be 2	Itd be 2	1.0
Itd be 2	Itd be 2	1.0
All right lets go on	If you add two towers high would be 4 because you have	4.0
If you add two towers high would be 4 because you have	Yeah I agree with that	1.0
Yeah I agree with that	Okay	0.0
Okay	I agree	1.0
Okay but hold on	See but you times that	3.0
See but you times that	Two times 2	3.0
Milin tell me  why	Because you for each one of them you could add 1 no 2  more or on because theres a black I mean a blue and red	4.0
Because you for each one of them you could add 1 no 2  more or on because theres a black I mean a blue and red	Yeah but what shes doing	0.0
Okay	See for that you just put one more for red you put a black on  top and a red on top I mean a blue on top instead of a black	4.0
See for that you just put one more for red you put a black on  top and a red on top I mean a blue on top instead of a black	And on blue you put a blue on top and a red on top	4.0
And on blue you put a blue on top and a red on top	You  keep on doing that	4.0
What did you say it would  be	It would be 8	3.0
Can can you give me an argument you dont  have to do it why we jump from 4 to 8	Thats what I want to know	0.0
Jeff	See see theres theres theres 2 blue	3.0
See see theres theres theres 2 blue	Theres 2 here	3.0
Theres 2 here	I know that	0.0
I know that	And we went to 4 so it would have to be times 22	4.0
And we went to 4 so it would have to be times 22	And  then 42 would equal 8	4.0
One at  a time	If this was like a pattern it would go 246 in between	4.0
Yeah thats what hes saying	No no no	0.0
No no no	No but  thats not the pattern that  were working on	3.0
Okay go ahead Stephanie	The pattern we saw was this for 1 block at a time we found  2	3.0
The pattern we saw was this for 1 block at a time we found  2	We all ready got 2 and 4 though	1.0
We all ready got 2 and 4 though	I know	1.0
I know	246	3.0
246	And then 8	3.0
And then 8	8 right	3.0
8 right	Two4then 8	3.0
Go ahead  let let Milin persuade Jeff	If you do that you just have to add for each one of those  you have to add one	4.0
These 4	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You have to add one more color per	3.0
Where are you putting that  one more color Milin	Two more colors for each one	3.0
Two more colors for each one	See	0.0
So this one with red on the bottom and blue on the top	You could put another blue or another red	3.0
Do you agree with that you could put a blue or red on top  and that would be	So that will be 2 and then on this you could do put another  read or a blue on top	4.0
So that will be 2 and then on this you could do put another  read or a blue on top	That would be 4	4.0
That would be 4	Thats the same right there	1.0
No this is bluered	No her look	0.0
No her look	Look its	0.0
Look its	Okay okay I see it	0.0
Okay okay I see it	See	0.0
See	Now you see it	0.0
And down  here you could put	A red or a blue and the same thing with here	3.0
Do you agree with that	Yeah because  cause theres 2 here and then 2 more	4.0
Yeah because  cause theres 2 here and then 2 more	No but if youre  bound to get a different  thing	1.0
No but if youre  bound to get a different  thing	If you use two colors youre bound to get a different  thing	4.0
If you use two colors youre bound to get a different  thing	Do do another one for blue and shell all ready have  it	0.0
Do do another one for blue and shell all ready have  it	She will	0.0
She will	Do it	0.0
Do it	Do 4	0.0
Do 4	Four that would be 16	4.0
Four that would be 16	No	1.0
No	Look she	0.0
Go ahead Jeff show me what	She she has 8 blocks with still only 2 colors	1.0
Okay what lets see this	She has like this red and she kept on alternating	1.0
She has like this red and she kept on alternating	Bluered bluered and she bluered until she got 8	1.0
Bluered bluered and she bluered until she got 8	And then blue	1.0
And then blue	And then she did the same thing up here	1.0
And then she did the same thing up here	I didnt do the same thing on top	1.0
I didnt do the same thing on top	Yeah you kept on alternating	1.0
He saw you alternating them  on the bottom	Now look you got red and blue	1.0
Look this is blueredblue redblueredbluered	This is the same thing up here	4.0
This is the same thing up here	Red and blue	4.0
Red and blue	Red  and blue	4.0
Red  and blue	See you have to cross off this one	4.0
See you have to cross off this one	And now red  and blue red and blue	4.0
And now red  and blue red and blue	Its a different way	4.0
Its a different way	You have to  cross off that one because theres another one all ready  there	4.0
You have to  cross off that one because theres another one all ready  there	And then over here you have that right there	4.0
And then over here you have that right there	But Jeff Jeff Jeff	0.0
But Jeff Jeff Jeff	But the thing is thats exactly	0.0
Listen to Milin	But that this is for 3	4.0
But that this is for 3	So you could add 2 for each one of the  3	4.0
So you could add 2 for each one of the  3	You didnt say that	1.0
You didnt say that	She was only doing	1.0
She was only doing	It was supposed to be 3 high	3.0
It was supposed to be 3 high	Yeah she was doing the bottom ones first	1.0
Yeah she was doing the bottom ones first	Thats why	1.0
Is that right Michelle	Its 3 high not 2	3.0
Its 3 high not 2	See	0.0
See	See how you got 8	1.0
See how you got 8	There would be 3  high so there would be	3.0
I even forget who it  was	You have to keep on putting 2 for this	4.0
You have to keep on putting 2 for this	Two for this	4.0
Two for this	Two for  this	4.0
Two for  this	And two for this	4.0
And two for this	And itll work out	4.0
Do you agree with that Jeff	Yes	1.0
So	Because you cant	4.0
Because you cant	Theres only two colors	4.0
Theres only two colors	You cant put  anymore on them	4.0
Because I heard Michelle say 12	Sixteen	3.0
Stephanie	I I still want to see you build 3 up and then see if theres  any	1.0
Okay Jeff isnt convinced you have the 8 here so you were  going to fast	Using Unifix cubes you could still	3.0
Using Unifix cubes you could still	It doesnt matter	0.0
It doesnt matter	Its just easier to draw it	0.0
Its just easier to draw it	I know	0.0
I know	T	0.0
T	why dont you draw what you think	0.0
why dont you draw what you think	Okay	0.0
Okay	You got that and thats the same as that	4.0
You got that and thats the same as that	Bluebluered	4.0
Bluebluered	Blueblue	4.0
Blueblue	No thats red	4.0
Redbluered	Yeah	0.0
Any ideas Stephanie how to show from 4 to 8	I do	0.0
I do	All right	0.0
Before Milin said you understood  when he got 4	I understand that but	0.0
These 4	And then	0.0
Youre going to run out of space if youre going to build  them up	Ill go down	0.0
Does it matter	No	0.0
Okay now what was his idea	I put too many things of red	4.0
I put too many things of red	Youve got 2 reds	4.0
Youve got 2 reds	Two blues  and the opposite	4.0
Two blues  and the opposite	Then youre adding onto one to make this  blue	4.0
Then youre adding onto one to make this  blue	And then you have to	4.0
Thats not what Milin said	What did he say	1.0
Lets wait  til hes finished thinking a minute and ask him  because I think thats the key to it to know what Milin said  and to see if that makes sense	The thing is that you have to keep on adding 2	3.0
He had this right	Okay then you just	0.0
Is that what you said	Yeah you have to keep on adding to the top	1.0
Yeah you have to keep on adding to the top	It doesnt matter	0.0
No he wants to add on the bottom	You see for this see you have have to have the bottom  down here because you cant put the top otherwise itll be  different	4.0
But he put a bottom  B  here	It would be the same	4.0
It would be the same	See if you put a  b  up there itd be  the same just as if you put on there	4.0
See if you put a  b  up there itd be  the same just as if you put on there	Itd be bluebluered	4.0
Itd be bluebluered	And then if you crossed that off itd be put a  b  up there  itd be bluebluered	4.0
And then if you crossed that off itd be put a  b  up there  itd be bluebluered	Just like before	4.0
Just like before	Yeah but Jeff Jeff	0.0
Okay but Hold on	If you look at this you have it	0.0
Thats interesting	But thats what we did	0.0
But thats what we did	Thats what she did	1.0
Thats what she did	She did	1.0
She did	So you could do it anyway but see theyre just put together	0.0
Next question well ask of you	See you put a blue here or  you could put a red there and this one  you could put this way	4.0
See you put a blue here or  you could put a red there and this one  you could put this way	You could put a red instead of the  blue	4.0
Thank you	See from this towers right	0.0
From from this one tower	See so I put the blue here the red here on top of it so its  like this	4.0
See so I put the blue here the red here on top of it so its  like this	And then I added one more	4.0
And then I added one more	That would be red	4.0
That would be red	But  then I did like this blue	4.0
But  then I did like this blue	Then I put the red back on top of it	4.0
Then I put the red back on top of it	Then I put a blue because theres only 2 colors and I all  ready	4.0
So what youre what youre telling me here if I could if I  could make my picture if I were doing what Milin asked me  to do where we had a blue and red what hes telling me to  do is hes saying from this tower Im going to put a blue on  the top	Or red	3.0
Is that what	Yeah and for each one you keep on doing that and for 6 you  get 64	4.0
Does that make any sense	It followed a pattern to 5 why cant it  follow a pattern to 6	2.0
That you couldve  put	But I made that	0.0
Red on the bottom blue	Red	0.0
From this one you could	Okay I understand	0.0
And hes  saying so from these 4	You could make 8	3.0
So tell me now convince Jeff why its going to be 8   why  its going to be double	Convinced	0.0
Convinced	I all ready figured it out with this	0.0
And whats different about the way you did it Michelle	I just I just I didnt do it the way Milin did it	1.0
I just I just I didnt do it the way Milin did it	I just made  them out and I didnt find any that werent the same	3.0
How about you Steph	I found it like this	0.0
I found it like this	I drew my lines	4.0
I drew my lines	And then I went redred red blueblueblue blueredblue redblueblue blueblue red redredblue redbluered blueredred	4.0
Is yours different than the way Milin did it	Yes	1.0
Yes	Well yes	1.0
In what way	He built his towers up like this	1.0
He built his towers up like this	He went red blue red blue  red blue and so on	1.0
I didnt see him do that	Michelle did it like that	1.0
And from this red	I put a red	3.0
I put a red	He put like	1.0
He put a red on top	And a blue one thats like	3.0
And from the blue	I did the same thing	1.0
And then he  put a blue on top and got blueblue	But thats like what hes like thats whats different from  mine	1.0
But thats like what hes like thats whats different from  mine	I just like took the things and went like I just took one  and went	0.0
I just like took the things and went like I just took one  and went	And kept on going	0.0
And kept on going	Heres one redredred blueblueblue	4.0
Heres one redredred blueblueblue	And then Id go like  redblueblue brb	4.0
Why does  that sound like guessing	Because what if you could make more	0.0
Because what if you could make more	Okay this is the 3 high right	3.0
Okay this is the 3 high right	And youre convinced you  could make 8	1.0
And youre convinced you  could make 8	Im convinced I could make 8	3.0
You could get two from this one and  two from this one and two from this one and two from this  one	But could you convince her	0.0
But could you convince her	Michelle	0.0
Michelle	Him	0.0
Him	No her	0.0
No her	Her	0.0
Her	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	All right	0.0
All right	Ive done this before	0.0
Ive done this before	Okay	0.0
Take another piece of paper if you want to because it sounds  like your approach is a little different	Okay	0.0
No more or  fewer	Whoa	0.0
Whoa	You do draw big	0.0
Lets see whats going on here	Okay first you have without any blue	3.0
Okay first you have without any blue	With just red	3.0
With just red	RRR	3.0
Okay no blues	Then you have with one blue	3.0
Okay	BRR Or RBR Or RRB	3.0
Anything else	And you would do the same pattern for everything else	3.0
And you would do the same pattern for everything else	No not with the blue	1.0
No not with the blue	Not with one blue	1.0
Not with one blue	You would you would do it with the one red and two  blues	3.0
You would you would do it with the one red and two  blues	You would alternate like	1.0
You would alternate like	You would do it the other way around	1.0
Maybe shes not  the same	Well theres no more of these because if you had to go  down the other one youd have to have another	3.0
Well theres no more of these because if you had to go  down the other one youd have to have another	But okay	0.0
Okay	Then you have with 3 blues	3.0
Then you have with 3 blues	Well no not with 3 blues	3.0
Well no not with 3 blues	Ill  go like that	0.0
You have no blues and now you have exactly one blue	Okay	0.0
Okay	Now you have exactly 2 blues	3.0
Now you have exactly 2 blues	Wait wait actually  yeah thats what I did last time because I did it back with 2  things	3.0
Okay lets see that	Then with 3 blues	3.0
Then with 3 blues	Which is	0.0
Which is	Then you get every single one	3.0
Then you get every single one	You could put BBR You could put RBB	3.0
You could put BBR You could put RBB	You could put BRB	1.0
You could put BRB	You could put	0.0
You could put	Yeah but thats not what Im doing	1.0
Yeah but thats not what Im doing	Im doing it so that  theyre stuck together	3.0
Im doing it so that  theyre stuck together	There should be one with one red	4.0
There should be one with one red	Then you could make it  up and then theres one with two reds and theres one with 3  reds	4.0
Then you could make it  up and then theres one with two reds and theres one with 3  reds	Ahh but see you did the same thing but theres blue	1.0
Ahh but see you did the same thing but theres blue	Theres all reds	4.0
Theres all reds	And then theres 3 reds 2 reds	4.0
And then theres 3 reds 2 reds	There  should be one with one red	4.0
There  should be one with one red	And then you change it to blue	4.0
And then you change it to blue	Well thats not how I do it	1.0
Okay now so what youve done so  far is	One blue	3.0
One blue	Two blue	3.0
No blues	One blue	3.0
One blue	Two blue	3.0
But Milin just said you dont have  all two blues and you said thats why is that	Okay show me another 2 blue	1.0
Okay show me another 2 blue	With  them stuck together because thats what Im doing it	3.0
With  them stuck together because thats what Im doing it	In that case	0.0
Okay now what are you doing Stephanie	But but if you just had 2 blues and they werent stuck  together you could	1.0
But but if you just had 2 blues and they werent stuck  together you could	But thats what Im doing Im doing the blues stuck  together	3.0
Okay	Then we had 3 blues that you could only make one of	4.0
Then we had 3 blues that you could only make one of	Then   you want 2 blues stuck apart not stuck apart took apart	4.0
Separated	Yeah separated	3.0
Yeah separated	And you can go blue red red  do I have  that	0.0
And you can go blue red red  do I have  that	No	0.0
No	Blue	3.0
Okay so Milin wanted to stick that in earlier I thought and Michelle right	When you were doing 2 blues	1.0
When you were doing 2 blues	You wanted  that stuck	1.0
You wanted  that stuck	Because see look at this	0.0
Because see look at this	For 2 reds and one blue	3.0
For 2 reds and one blue	Two  reds	3.0
Two  reds	And thats stuck together here for 2 reds	1.0
And thats stuck together here for 2 reds	Yeah so youre following no pattern	1.0
Yeah so youre following no pattern	And you have more stuck together here	1.0
And you have more stuck together here	Well youre following your pattern	1.0
Well youre following your pattern	But my pattern goes no  red one red	4.0
But my pattern goes no  red one red	This was not meant to be like that	4.0
This was not meant to be like that	Thats not	4.0
Thats not	Its in the category of one blue	4.0
Its in the category of one blue	That	4.0
That	I could stick that some  place in another category	4.0
I could stick that some  place in another category	But I want this to be in the  category of one blue	4.0
But I want this to be in the  category of one blue	Not in the category of the opposite of  this one	4.0
Not in the category of the opposite of  this one	And then I have this one the redredblue	4.0
And then I have this one the redredblue	So to  you that you might put that way at the end of the line	4.0
So to  you that you might put that way at the end of the line	But I  put it right here	4.0
But I  put it right here	I have a question	0.0
I have a question	Do you have to make a pattern	0.0
Do you have to make a pattern	No	0.0
No	Well then why is everybody going by a pattern	2.0
Well then why is everybody going by a pattern	Because we liked it	0.0
Because we liked it	Yeah its easier	3.0
Yeah its easier	Its easier	1.0
Its easier	Because its easier than just going oohooh	4.0
Because its easier than just going oohooh	Because if you because if you because if you just keep on  guessing like that youre not sure if theres going to be  more	4.0
Because if you because if you because if you just keep on  guessing like that youre not sure if theres going to be  more	Stephanie Its easier maybe like Shelly and Milins pattern was to go  put this in a different category	1.0
Stephanie Its easier maybe like Shelly and Milins pattern was to go  put this in a different category	I know their patterns	1.0
I know their patterns	Okay but what Im saying is that its that its just easier to  work with a pattern	3.0
Okay but what Im saying is that its that its just easier to  work with a pattern	Oh heres another one	0.0
Oh heres another one	Lets see	0.0
Lets see	Yeah Ill put that in	0.0
Yeah Ill put that in	Because you might have a duplicate	1.0
Because you might have a duplicate	And and you may not  know	1.0
And and you may not  know	Its harder to check	1.0
Its harder to check	Its harder to check just having them  like come up from out of the blue	1.0
Its harder to check just having them  like come up from out of the blue	Then just going like this and getting 2 from	3.0
Then just going like this and getting 2 from	How do you know theres different things in the pattern	2.0
How do you know theres different things in the pattern	Since see look at this	0.0
Since see look at this	These are all different right	3.0
These are all different right	I see that	1.0
I see that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah see	0.0
Yeah see	From this right you can make two more so  because here theres a bluered and then a blue red	4.0
From this right you can make two more so  because here theres a bluered and then a blue red	Because because theres only 2 colors more so you know  you cant make more	4.0
Because because theres only 2 colors more so you know  you cant make more	Yeah so	0.0
Yeah so	And then theres red I mean blueredred	4.0
And then theres red I mean blueredred	And you cant  make anymore on this one so you go onto the next one	4.0
And you cant  make anymore on this one so you go onto the next one	All right and then	1.0
All right and then	How do you know you cant make any more from that	2.0
How do you know you cant make any more from that	Because	0.0
Because	Because theres not any more color	4.0
Because theres not any more color	Look	0.0
Look	Okay	0.0
Okay	Start here	0.0

You have the 1 blue	How could I  build another one blue	2.0
How could I  build another one blue	You you cant	1.0
You you cant	All right	0.0
All right	So Ive convinced you that theres no more 1 blue	1.0
So Ive convinced you that theres no more 1 blue	right	1.0
right	But if you didnt have that pattern it would be harder to  convince you	4.0
But if you didnt have that pattern it would be harder to  convince you	If I went Ill put this one blue over here	4.0
If I went Ill put this one blue over here	And that blue will  itll be on another piece of paper	4.0
And that blue will  itll be on another piece of paper	However that goes	4.0
However that goes	Yeah but you can make a blue different what if you go  like this	4.0
Yeah but you can make a blue different what if you go  like this	Thats if you have 4	4.0
Thats if you have 4	If you go like this	4.0
If you go like this	You can go rrb or you can go brr  Red	4.0
You can go rrb or you can go brr  Red	Thats what I have	1.0
Thats what I have	No	1.0
No	No	1.0

Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So Ive convinced you theres no more 1 blue	1.0
So Ive convinced you theres no more 1 blue	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	All right now	0.0
All right now	Then you have to go to 2 blue	3.0
Then you have to go to 2 blue	Two blue	1.0
Two blue	Heres one right	0.0
Heres one right	2 blue	1.0
2 blue	We have one bbr  then we have rbb	4.0
We have one bbr  then we have rbb	How am I supposed to make another  one	2.0

Brb	No this is the other	1.0
No this is the other	Milin gave me that same argument	1.0
Milin gave me that same argument	She means she means together	1.0
She means she means together	But the thing is it doesnt matter	1.0
But the thing is it doesnt matter	I dont	0.0
I dont	No she means stuck together	1.0
No she means stuck together	Stuck together that means like okay I took	1.0
Stuck together that means like okay I took	I know	0.0
I know	Okay so can I make any more of that kind	3.0
Okay so can I make any more of that kind	Then you have to move to three which you can only make  1	3.0
Then you have to move to three which you can only make  1	Yeah you can only make 1 and then you could make the 3  without blue and where theres 3 red	4.0
Yeah you can only make 1 and then you could make the 3  without blue and where theres 3 red	Then you can make 2 split apart	3.0
Then you can make 2 split apart	Two split apart which you can only make 1 of	4.0
Two split apart which you can only make 1 of	And then  you could make you could find the opposites right in the  same group	4.0
And then  you could make you could find the opposites right in the  same group	All right so then Ive convinced  you that theres only 8	1.0
All right so then Ive convinced  you that theres only 8	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
How many if youre making towers of 4	16	3.0
You agree Jeff	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Because you have	0.0
This  could be pressure here	See look its because say you add a red or a blue you can  add a red or blue here	4.0
Make a drawing for your sentence showing it	I understand because you can only you could put	0.0
I understand because you can only you could put	Put 2 colors here you could put 2 colors there	4.0
Put 2 colors here you could put 2 colors there	You can keep on going	4.0
You can keep on going	You can keep doing 2 colors for each one and thats	1.0
You can keep doing 2 colors for each one and thats	246810121416	4.0
And so thats for towers of	4	3.0
4	My guess is 16 but	1.0
My guess is 16 but	We all ready got 16	1.0
We all ready got 16	Why why did she say in the beginning of the whole thing  that 12	1.0
Why why did she say in the beginning of the whole thing  that 12	This	0.0
This	Its its like its like	0.0
Why did you say 12 Michelle	Listen you could do a red or a blue	3.0
Listen you could do a red or a blue	You could do either a  red or a blue	3.0
You could do either a  red or a blue	A red or a blue	3.0
A red or a blue	Jeff Jeff Jeff	0.0
Jeff Jeff Jeff	I know that  But I want to  know why she said 12 before	1.0
I know that  But I want to  know why she said 12 before	Yeah Michelle why did you	1.0
Yeah Michelle why did you	Because she was guessing not making patterns	1.0
You think  12 or 16 Michelle	16	3.0
Now now you made towers of 5 in  class and what did you get	32	3.0
Does that work the same way	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	If you get towers of 4	3.0
If you get towers of 4	Theyre multiples of 2	1.0
Theyre multiples of 2	The hard part is making patterns	3.0
The hard part is making patterns	Like you from now we  know how to just oh you could give us a problem like how  many in 10 and wed know	4.0
You know the answer	I know the answer	0.0
I know the answer	I figured it out	0.0
I figured it out	Its 1024	3.0
Are you sure	Uhhuh	0.0
Uhhuh	Dont try to convince me	0.0
Try to convince him	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
No	Okay okay okay	0.0
Okay okay okay	I think we have 1000 units	3.0
However you were saying you  know the answer but	But the problem is the hard part is you could just give us a  problem and we could go like well well go 222	3.0
But the problem is the hard part is you could just give us a  problem and we could go like well well go 222	See for how were doing you keep on adding what you have  all ready	4.0
See for how were doing you keep on adding what you have  all ready	For here you add 2 more	4.0
For here you add 2 more	For here you add  another 4 so for here and for the 16	4.0
For here you add  another 4 so for here and for the 16	You sure its 1000	1.0
You sure its 1000	You sure	1.0
You sure	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Because look you have	0.0
Because look you have	Now see youre dividing the	1.0
Now see youre dividing the	Im not dividing	1.0
Im not dividing	The problem	0.0
The problem	Youre timesing no you dont times it	1.0
Youre timesing no you dont times it	Its the  same thing I did	1.0
Its the  same thing I did	I counted ahead	3.0
I counted ahead	I just counted ahead 5 or  6 and I said oh I could just multiply it by that and thatll  give me the same answer but it didnt work	4.0
I just counted ahead 5 or  6 and I said oh I could just multiply it by that and thatll  give me the same answer but it didnt work	Okay	1.0
Okay	It didnt work	1.0
It didnt work	Okay	1.0
Okay	You have to figure out whats in between that	3.0
What do you mean	In between okay	3.0
Show me a little bit	Do you want me to figure out 10 right	4.0
Do you want me to figure out 10 right	But in order to  figure out 10 I was only up to 5	4.0
But in order to  figure out 10 I was only up to 5	So what I had to do was I  had to go and I had to say well whats 6 whats 7 whats  8 and whats 9 and times that times the last number I had	4.0
When I asked Stephanie how many for towers of  10 what Stephanie why dont you say what you did to get  1024 and then lets talk about this	Yup shes right	1.0
Yup shes right	I was up to 5 so I took the 6	0.0
I was up to 5 so I took the 6	I was up to 6	0.0
Towers of 6	Okay now I was up to 6	0.0
You agree with that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So I multiplied I tried first of all I tried multiplying it times  8 because I figured well all I have to do was 64 times 2  thats 8 so 64 times 8	4.0
So I multiplied I tried first of all I tried multiplying it times  8 because I figured well all I have to do was 64 times 2  thats 8 so 64 times 8	What are you saying	1.0
What are you saying	She did it wrong	1.0
Lets hear her  thinking	First I thought well I dont want to go ahead and I dont  want to have to multiply 7 8 9 and 10	4.0
First I thought well I dont want to go ahead and I dont  want to have to multiply 7 8 9 and 10	7 8 9 before I get  10	4.0
7 8 9 before I get  10	So I figured 64 equals 10	4.0
So I figured 64 equals 10	And since Im timesing  times 2 Ill multiply 42 to get 8 and then just multiply  648	4.0
And since Im timesing  times 2 Ill multiply 42 to get 8 and then just multiply  648	But she was wrong	1.0
But she was wrong	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then and then no she was right here	1.0
And then and then no she was right here	She only timesed  it by 2 so she was right	1.0
She only timesed  it by 2 so she was right	Then I did	0.0
Then I did	You keep timesing it by 2	1.0
You keep timesing it by 2	Then I did 1282	4.0
Then I did 1282	256 512 and then	4.0
256 512 and then	You get your answer	1.0
How come she got something she got 512	And you all ready got 512 over there	3.0
So Is that so very wrong	And then you couldve timesed this by 2	1.0
And then you couldve timesed this by 2	No thats the same thing	1.0
No thats the same thing	But you couldve just timesed this by 2 and you wouldve  had it a lot easier than going times times times	1.0
Why did you have to keep	Ahh I just thought of something	0.0
Ahh I just thought of something	Im wondering if this will  work	0.0
Im wondering if this will  work	This 8 is 8 okay	3.0
This 8 is 8 okay	This is 8 right	3.0
This is 8 right	This is the  answer to 8	3.0
This is the  answer to 8	You had it right you just didnt follow a pattern you just  took a guess	1.0
You had it right you just didnt follow a pattern you just  took a guess	And then if you filled it out exactly	1.0
It gave you 512 which was	Which gave you to 8	1.0
Or to 9	So if you	0.0
So if you	This pattern works here	3.0
If I plugged in 8 or 9	It wouldve worked her pattern wouldve	1.0
Lets get another piece of paper and see what happened here  because this is just a mess	It wouldve worked where but then she has to	1.0
Lets start again	to times it by 2  after she gets her number	1.0
to times it by 2  after she gets her number	She has to times it by 2 after she  gets her number	1.0
But you know what Im thinking Im thinking maybe what  we should do is I want you to I dont want to throw away	s idea here okay because what Stephanie has  here in her idea once she got to towers of 9 right she said  there were 512	4.0
s idea here okay because what Stephanie has  here in her idea once she got to towers of 9 right she said  there were 512	Thats by each time multiplying it by 2	4.0
Thats by each time multiplying it by 2	And then you have to move	4.0
And then you have to move	This would work if you multiply it times 2	4.0
This would work if you multiply it times 2	You still get 1024 like over here	4.0
Right but why why didnt multiplying by 8 work when she  had towers of 6	Because because she wasnt so sure about going like this	1.0
If I said  towers of	80	3.0
Now and I said Ill give you a calculator but you have  to know what to do with your calculator right	Theres a problem because you have to go all the way from  10 to 80	3.0
What do you have there	Towers of 7	3.0
Is that what you have Milin	Yeah I think	0.0
How could you jump  from towers of 6 to towers of 10 without going through all  those steps and why	Get out	0.0
You said this  was like shirts and pants and I would like for you to say if  you agree its like shirts and pants	I agree	1.0
But why	But if you kept on going up you would have to add	4.0
Lets hear Jeff	You have the same pattern same pattern	3.0
In what way	Because with shirts you have to keep on alternating the  shirts with the pants	4.0
Because with shirts you have to keep on alternating the  shirts with the pants	And keep on alternating pants with the  shirts	4.0
Im not so sure I follow what youre saying	Neither do I	0.0
Stephanie is working on the towers of 10	I might have it here	0.0
I might have it here	Im thinking if I multiply the last  number I got which was 1024 times 80 that I got   81120 but  Im not sure if Im right or not	4.0
Im thinking if I multiply the last  number I got which was 1024 times 80 that I got   81120 but  Im not sure if Im right or not	You know Id have to go  through all that	0.0
You know Id have to go  through all that	Nuhuh	1.0
Nuhuh	Nuhuh	1.0
Nuhuh	Or maybe you would multiply it by 70 because you all ready  go 10	4.0
Or maybe you would multiply it by 70 because you all ready  go 10	No but times it by 8   because you have to have 8 more	4.0
Me too Im lost too	You wouldnt times it by 8 because we timesed it by 8 when  we were on 8	4.0
You wouldnt times it by 8 because we timesed it by 8 when  we were on 8	We times it by 80 when were on 80	4.0
We times it by 80 when were on 80	True	1.0
Hold on	Nuhuh	0.0
Nuhuh	Did you times it by 80 when you were on 80	1.0
Did you times it by 80 when you were on 80	I went I said well there was	0.0
I went I said well there was	88	4.0
88	64	4.0
64	How could that be	2.0
How could that be	Actually you would multiply it by 1600	3.0
Can can we call time out for a minute	What are you guys talking about	0.0
I want you to solve the problem of towers of  10	We did that	0.0
But hold on you have to pretend you only know the answer  for towers of 6	Just keep on building	3.0
Thats one way	I all ready did that	0.0
I all ready did that	I all ready did that	0.0
I all ready did that	You want us to try and figure it out the way I tried to figure  it out the first time	3.0
Do you understand	This	0.0
This	But all you did	0.0
Time out	You didnt know times 2 times 2 would help you	1.0
You didnt know times 2 times 2 would help you	I did	1.0
But I want to save all those  intermediate steps because if you had to go to to build  towers of 80 lets see when you had to build towers of 2 of  2 how many times of 3 high how many times did you  multiply by 2	Shes right Jeff	1.0
Shes right Jeff	You should really multiply by 8	3.0
When you had to build towers of 3 how many times did you  need to multiply by 2	Times 3	4.0
Times 3	4 times 2	4.0
I said by 2	Oh	0.0
Oh	4	3.0
4	Same thing	0.0
Then you multiply by 2 again	8	3.0
So how many times did you multiply  by 2	You multiplied the amount of times you	1.0
So you  multiplied it twice to build towers of 3 is that right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
No	Because to get towers of 2 then it will be much easier	4.0
Because to get towers of 2 then it will be much easier	Yeah but the thing is its right its easier	1.0
I think weve run out of time	Yeah we did	0.0
Will you come back	Yeah okay	0.0
Okay next question is I want to know what this has to do  with shirts and pants	Shirts and pants	0.0
Shirts and pants	No	0.0
No	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	I have no idea	2.0
I have no idea	I didnt think of it	0.0
You can talk about it before and share it	Can I tell you what I told you last time I was here about  shirts and pants	0.0
What what	Because remember it was the problem with the shirts the  pants	4.0
Because remember it was the problem with the shirts the  pants	You had to match up Stevens pants with the shirts to  make like a tower	4.0
Yeah	Remember	0.0
Remember	He has to have at least big hands	0.0
I love coming to talk to you about  math	Thank you	0.0
And Im a little hard of hearing	Valerie shares some of the 12 candies from this box	0.0
Valerie shares some of the 12 candies from this box	She gave Cindy 1 candy for every 3 candies she eats herself	0.0
Okay so when you and your partner are ready could you and your partner go ahead and share what you think is going on in this illustration	For every 3	4.0
For every 3	So theres 12 candies right	4.0
So theres 12 candies right	So whats 12 divided by 4	4.0
So whats 12 divided by 4	3	3.0
3	So 12 divided by 4 is 3	4.0
So 12 divided by 4 is 3	So 3	4.0
And you  are Ashank	For every like 3 candies that she that Valerie has Cindy would only get 1	4.0
What do you think they were thinking	Like in one column it contains in one row it contains 4 candies	3.0
Andrew what do you think	the person counted 3 candies for Valerie and then put a C in the next candy because Valerie gets 3 candies	4.0
Cynthia	This person thought in rows instead of columns and for every row he had 3 Vs and 1 C	3.0
Yes sir what did you want to add to that	I think that theres maybe kind of a fraction way	3.0
What do you mean	Like for in every row theres 4 columns I mean 4 rows	3.0
Im understanding now	So then 1 is given to Cindy and 3 is given to Valerie so 1 4 is given to Cindy in each row	4.0
And then go ahead and share with your partner when youre ready	The second one  I think its the second one	4.0
The second one  I think its the second one	Because for each 3 that Valerie eats she gives one to her friend Cindy	4.0
Because for each 3 that Valerie eats she gives one to her friend Cindy	I mean give one candy to Cindy	4.0
How about the first one	This first one is stopping confusing	2.0
Jake	I think the second one is better because	3.0
This one	Because if youre looking its confusing 3 Valeries and then 1	3.0
And  let me get your name  Ashank nice and loud	I think that it would be also a good thing	4.0
I think that it would be also a good thing	Because your brain in the first one your brain is its like very complicated to calculate like all the candies and the things that Valerie will eat and Cindy	4.0
Because your brain in the first one your brain is its like very complicated to calculate like all the candies and the things that Valerie will eat and Cindy	But in the second its easy to calculate	4.0
Okay so you think this one is a little harder to interpret	Yeah	0.0
What did you want to add Saurabh	I think the first one would be easier because because when you put the  it will be easier for people to understand because you can just draw the figure and put Vs in the ones that Valerie eats and then C in the ones Cindy eats	4.0
I think the first one would be easier because because when you put the  it will be easier for people to understand because you can just draw the figure and put Vs in the ones that Valerie eats and then C in the ones Cindy eats	So then you can go in a kind of pattern 3 for Valerie 1 for Cindy	4.0
So then you can go in a kind of pattern 3 for Valerie 1 for Cindy	Then 3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	4.0
Then 3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	3 more for Valerie 1 for Cindy	4.0
You think this ones easier to see	Yeah the pattern  to understand	3.0
Kevin could you read this for us	Anthony makes candy	0.0
Nice and loud	First he mixes 1 cup of cream with 2 cups of chocolate	0.0
First he mixes 1 cup of cream with 2 cups of chocolate	In all he uses 9 cups of the two ingrdients	0.0
Ingredients	Ingredients	0.0
Yeah	How many cups of chocolate does he use in his candy recipe	0.0
I see some private thumbs  and when you and your partner are both ready go ahead and you may share	So he thinks each one is 9 cups he forgot the  in all	1.0
So he thinks each one is 9 cups he forgot the  in all	Yeah he didnt write the	1.0
Yeah he didnt write the	Yeah he saw it	1.0
Yeah he saw it	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Because he thinks every cup is 9 cups but he forgot the  in all	1.0
Because he thinks every cup is 9 cups but he forgot the  in all	So he used 3 cups in one ingredient and then to make it 9 cups he had to add that ingredient 2 more times	1.0
So he used 3 cups in one ingredient and then to make it 9 cups he had to add that ingredient 2 more times	So it makes 3  3  3 which equals 9	4.0
What do you think	I think the problem is long and he misunderstood the question I think he only thought that it was both cups combined	1.0
Really loud I can barely hear you	Hes wrong because he thought both the chocolate and the cream were 9 cups which means in all it had 18 cups	4.0
Hes wrong because he thought both the chocolate and the cream were 9 cups which means in all it had 18 cups	But the question said that in all they had 9 cups only	4.0
The problem gives the answer  Private think time Shhh private think time and then pair share when both you and your partner are ready	That is only 3 cups and in all there should be 9 cups	3.0
That is only 3 cups and in all there should be 9 cups	Oh	0.0
Oh	And the correct answer should be 69ths  or 23	3.0
What do you think of this one	I think that the person who answered this problem didnt read the whole problem	1.0
Any other ideas from Daniel	I think its wrong because if you made 2 cups of chocolate and 7 cups of cream but the problem says for every 1 cup of cream he makes 2 cups of chocolate so he would have 14 cups of chocolate total	4.0
So if they only had the 2 cups of chocolate here youre saying he would have had 7 cups of cream	Yeah	0.0
Andrew did you have one more thing to add	The persons wrong because if theres only 2 cups of chocolate there will only be 1 cup of cream and that equals only 3 cups of ingredients	1.0
Think about this one Im seeing a few private thumbs remember that when you and your partner are both ready to share you may share	So I think he meant theres 18 chocolates which doesnt make sense because in total theres 9 cups in all	4.0
So I think he meant theres 18 chocolates which doesnt make sense because in total theres 9 cups in all	I think he misunderstood the question because he probably thought there were 9 cups of everything	4.0
I think he misunderstood the question because he probably thought there were 9 cups of everything	Oh	4.0
Oh	And then like 9 cups of cream and then 2 cups  I dont know what he meant but hes wrong	0.0
What do you think of the diagram	Uh I was going to say what he said	1.0
Well I know but I didnt hear so can you say it again	I said that she misunderstanded she misunderstood the question just like the first person	1.0
I said that she misunderstanded she misunderstood the question just like the first person	Because in all theres 9	3.0
Because in all theres 9	Probably thought like since theres 2 and the problem said 2 cups of chocolate he probably thought every 2 cups theres like 9 cups or something and then thats how you got 2  9  the 18 cups but	4.0
What would you like to tell us about this one	Because the student thought um misunderstood that the 9 cups was only for the cream so then he multiplied another one because there are two ingredients to get the answer	4.0
Really loudly so I can hear	He thought that 9 cups is used for 1 ingredient	1.0
Do you know which one	Um for cream	3.0
Um for cream	And then he multiplied another one for the chocolate and then he got the answer18	4.0
Would you call on somebody else to to help with why they think that might have happened	Jason	0.0
Jason	Um because I think that person got it mixed up by thinking that the other times the 2 cups chocolate to the 9 the answer of the in total of 9 cups the answer of 1 cup of cream to the 9 whole to the in total of 9 cups so then he um so he made 27 cups	4.0
Timothy	Um basically	0.0
Um basically	If instead of 9 cups in all it would be 27 he would have been right	4.0
If instead of 9 cups in all it would be 27 he would have been right	He used the 9 in the wrong way	4.0
He used the 9 in the wrong way	By multiplying the the 9 he multiplied the 2 and the 1 and then add them up	4.0
By multiplying the the 9 he multiplied the 2 and the 1 and then add them up	So that you get 27	4.0
So that you get 27	But if in all if he had done that if hed known that there were 27 cups he would have been correct	4.0
Your name again  thats right Charlotte	Um its basically like the first problem he thought it was 9 cups of each so then it said 2 cups of chocolate so basically he multiplied 1 cup and then he uses 9 cups for cream and then 2 cups of the 9 cups of chocolate	4.0
And I see I know it begins with an A Ashank	Whoever did the problem they could have like um they could have just added the 2 chocolate the 2 cups of chocolate and the 1 cup of cream which would have equaled 3 and then divided it by 9 which would which would actually for every you would get like 3 since 3  3 is 9 youd get 3 um 3s and for every 3 thered be like 2 cups of chocolate and thered be 1 cup of cream which would have eventually if youd have added up all the 2s you would have gotten  cups of chocolate	4.0
Okay  he would have gotten what	the cups of chocolate	3.0
Im not sure I understood you were saying if you added up the 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate	Yes which would have equaled 3	3.0
So this here  would have been 3 cups	Yes	0.0
Okay	And then for every 3 cups thered be 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream	3.0
Okay and so for this grouping of 3 heres where you see your 2 cups of chocolate and 1 cup of cream	Yes	0.0
Did you have something to add to that	The answer would be to add those two together would equal 3 as he said	4.0
Uh huh	and you would have to divide it by 9 because thats your number of total and then you would get 3 and thats how many servings he does	4.0
and you would have to divide it by 9 because thats your number of total and then you would get 3 and thats how many servings he does	Then you need 2 cups of chocolate and every 1 cup of cream you have to multiply like 3 by 2 to get 6	4.0
Then you need 2 cups of chocolate and every 1 cup of cream you have to multiply like 3 by 2 to get 6	It would be 6 cups of cream	4.0
What did you want to say Saurabh	What Jason said so then uh like what he said	1.0
What Jason said so then uh like what he said	There would theres 3 cups 3 cups of the ingredients in the chocolate	4.0
There would theres 3 cups 3 cups of the ingredients in the chocolate	So then um	4.0
So then um	So then he said that theres 9 cups of the uh ingredients	4.0
So then he said that theres 9 cups of the uh ingredients	But they he has to divide it by 3 because theres in the first row theres 3 uh	4.0
In this that Ashank was telling us about	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So then that would equal 3	4.0
So then that would equal 3	But since theres uh its asking uh how many how many cups of chocolate he used in the recipe they you have to multiply it by 2	4.0
And Andrew what did you want to add	Basically following Ashank but after he added the 1 cream and 2 chocolates equals 3 he does that keeps doing that until he gets a total of 9	4.0
Oh	When he counts up all the chocolates	1.0
So youre saying we need to do this part	Yeah and then you keep like circling groups of 3 until you get a total of 9	4.0
Until you get a total of 9	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then you count up all the chocolates and that would be 6 chocolates	4.0
So thats where you see the 6	Yeah	0.0
Did you want to add onto that Ashank	Well basically my answer was also 6	3.0
What did you want to say	I agree with Andrew but then um especially the part where he thought based on the 9 cups of the ingredients he multiplied it by 1 cup of cream so and then since each cup of cream theres 2 cups of chocolate so then multiply 2 cups of chocolate by 9 cups of cream so they got 18 cups of chocolate	4.0
They were ready	The 1 and 2 that equals the 3	4.0
The 1 and 2 that equals the 3	And then 2 and 4 thats 6 and then he did 3 cream and 6 chocolate thats already 9 but since he kept going 4 cream and 8 chocolates it equals the 12 and its supposed to be only 9 cups of ingredients	4.0
And then 2 and 4 thats 6 and then he did 3 cream and 6 chocolate thats already 9 but since he kept going 4 cream and 8 chocolates it equals the 12 and its supposed to be only 9 cups of ingredients	And you	0.0
And you	I dont really get this one	2.0
I dont really get this one	Its kind of like what I did	0.0
Its kind of like what I did	Um	0.0
Um	For every 1 cup of cream he did 2 cups of chocolate and he did it again 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate and that would equal to um 2 cups of cream 4 cups of chocolate	4.0
For every 1 cup of cream he did 2 cups of chocolate and he did it again 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate and that would equal to um 2 cups of cream 4 cups of chocolate	And then he kept doing that but then he kept going	4.0
And then he kept doing that but then he kept going	So at the end he did it wrong	1.0
So at the end he did it wrong	Because he should have stopped when he had 3 cream and 6 cups of chocolate	4.0
Because he should have stopped when he had 3 cream and 6 cups of chocolate	Oh	0.0
Oh	Because if he kept going on he would have 12 and its not 9	4.0
What do you think	The answer is logical	0.0
The answer is logical	On the chart it says 8 cups of chocolate with the 4 cups of cream but if you add them together it makes 12 cups in total	4.0
On the chart it says 8 cups of chocolate with the 4 cups of cream but if you add them together it makes 12 cups in total	But the problem says Anthony made 9 cups in total for the ingredients	4.0
What do you think Saurabh	He was heading in the right direction but then he went up to 4 which was wrong because he should have reached up to 3 because theres 9 cups in total and	4.0
So youre saying this student should have stopped here	Yeah	0.0
Did you have something to say	I think he wrote 8 cups because he misinterpreted the sentence	4.0
I think he wrote 8 cups because he misinterpreted the sentence	He thought that you have to use 9 cups of the 2 of chocolate only in the ingredients so he got 8 cups which is the closest	4.0
He thought that you have to use 9 cups of the 2 of chocolate only in the ingredients so he got 8 cups which is the closest	But then and he didnt want to go over the limit so he just wrote 8	4.0
What did you want to add Timothy	I disagree with Jake because if he thought that only 1 cup would go for 1 cup of cream would go for every 1 cup of cream would go in the whole recipe then he wouldnt have had 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate 2 cups of cream and 4 he would have just had 1 cup of cream and 2 of chocolate 1 cup of cream and 4 of chocolate	4.0
I disagree with Jake because if he thought that only 1 cup would go for 1 cup of cream would go for every 1 cup of cream would go in the whole recipe then he wouldnt have had 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of chocolate 2 cups of cream and 4 he would have just had 1 cup of cream and 2 of chocolate 1 cup of cream and 4 of chocolate	If he thought that 1 cup only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	4.0
You said it would go 1 and 4	If he thought only 1 cup of cream goes into the whole recipe	1.0
Okay	Then he wouldnt have had 2 cups of cream for 4 cups of chocolate	1.0
Okay so youre saying this 1 because they had the solution of 8 cups that they were only counting 1 cup of cream in the whole recipe	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But if they had it up to the 4 that doesnt make sense that theres only 1	1.0
Did you want to respond	I dont think that Tim understanded me because I mean like he thought that all the ingredients combined is 9 cups he thought it was just the chocolate that needed 9 cups	4.0
And  Samuel	The empty spaces or boxes	3.0
Osi where do you see the 9	All of them	3.0
Claire	In simplest form	3.0
Whats your	There are two empty columns and three columns together	3.0
Can you say that  tell me what she was saying about the the 2 and the 3	Theres 3 columns	3.0
So 1 2 3	And two of them have been eaten so that makes the fraction which is eaten 23	4.0
Okay	Well at least he got the method right	1.0
Well at least he got the method right	He or she got the method right and I hope the answer right	1.0
Kevin what are you thinking	Hes very close to the answer but he messed up	1.0
Hes very close to the answer but he messed up	So 1 cream plus 2 chocolate equals 3 so 3 of them they they subtract then they come out its 9 then he just go on not	4.0
9 in all so youre saying theyre very close because they added the 1 and the 2 to get the 3 kind of like I think Ashank was helping us with over here	Uh huh	0.0
What did you want to add Cynthia	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	He knew that 1 cup of cream is with 2 cups of chocolate and that equals 3 but she knew that the total cups was 9 so had to multiply 3 by 3 and so they  2 cups of chocolate that would make 6 cups of chocolate	4.0
Daniel	I would think hes right because he knows that theres 9 cups in total and for every 1 cup of cream theres 2 chocolates so he first adds them up and theres only 3 but then the whole thing is 9 so he thinks he should do more until he reaches 9 and then if you add the chocolates itd be 6	4.0
but remember that whatever   number you put in the first box what do you have to do	Put it in the rest of them	0.0
Good	Oh I got it	0.0
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	0.0
Oh I got it	Oh I got it	0.0
What	Six times six	3.0
Okay hum let s get the paper passed out and let s try that	That s not true	1.0
That s not true	Yes it is	1.0
Yes it is	Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is   thirty	4.0
Six times six is thirtysix minus five times six is   thirty	No it s impossible that s wrong	1.0
No it s impossible that s wrong	Yeah that s right	1.0
Yeah that s right	That s one of the ways	3.0
That s one of the ways	I told you	0.0
I told you	Oh shut up	0.0
Oh shut up	It doesn t work	1.0
It doesn t work	Why don t you pass the paper down	0.0
Does work or   doesn t work	Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	3.0
Six doesn t work so just kick me in the head	There are two different numbers Jeff	1.0
There are two different numbers Jeff	Two different   numbers	1.0
Six doesn t work okay	No two	3.0
No two	A couple different can go	3.0
A couple different can go	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	Doesn t it have to be all one number have to be in   every box	3.0
Yes the same number has to be	But there is two different possible answers though	3.0
But there is two different possible answers though	I think I got it	0.0
I think I got it	I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I   got it	0.0
Michelle	Two	3.0
Two	Yeah	0.0
Everybody agrees with that	Oh I  don t want it to be right	1.0
Matt can you show  that	I have a different number	1.0
I have a different number	I think it might work with three	3.0
Yeah okay and	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Two and three work that works	3.0
How much is that	Negative six	3.0
How much is that	Plus the six would be zero	3.0
Plus the six would be zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Yes	0.0
Yes	Thank You	0.0
And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	True	3.0
True	That was three	3.0
Do I put the two  here or here	No three wouldn t work	3.0
No three wouldn t work	In the brackets	3.0
It goes in the truth set that makes it true	Let s try three now	3.0
Let s try three now	Three	1.0
Now various people are saying three	Three is not going to work	1.0
You say three you say three  it works	It is	0.0
It is	It works	3.0
It works	Three is going to work	1.0
Three is going to work	I m just thinking don t	0.0
I m just thinking don t	No	0.0
No	It works	3.0
It works	It works	1.0
So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that	Negative six	3.0
how much is that	Zero	3.0
Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false	It s true	3.0
Okay well I ve got some of these that I made up that I am  wondering if I can get any of them cause they re so hard  that none of you can do them	How about if we make something and have it like be  impossible	2.0
Not even Michelle not anybody not Ankur not Milin not anybody	Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus  fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	0.0
Like ninety times ninety minus three hundred sixty minus  fortytwo plus eighteen equals nine	If it s impossible forget it	0.0
If it s impossible forget it	The first one is easy	0.0
The first one is easy	It s right  up there	0.0
It s right  up there	Do we write both of them	0.0
Okay	Should we go onto the next one	0.0
You may as well	Didn t we do this one already	0.0
I need two   people to volunteer for something	He got the whole class	0.0
I   guess	So they raise their hands higher	0.0
Now this is the really   tricky job here	Oh me	0.0
Oh me	Oh not me	0.0
Amy Lynn would you would you   say go	Go	0.0
You have to say it loudly	Go	0.0
How many do you want him to put in	Seven	0.0
Seven	All of them	0.0
Okay you agree he put seven in	I believe so	3.0
Now are there more of those pieces of glass in the bag uh  than there were when Amy Lynn said go or there are     fewer	There are more now	3.0
How many more	Seven	3.0
Seven	Seven more	1.0
This was a   seven because he counted in seven okay then but this is it is it true that there are seven pieces of glass in  that bag	There is more than seven	3.0
There is more than seven	At least seven	1.0
What is it that this is saying	That he added seven	3.0
Saying that there are more	Uh huh	0.0
Well I guess in some sense this is adding seven but this is saying as a result	Seven more	3.0
How many would you like Milin to take out	Twelve	0.0
Okay	Twelve	0.0
Twelve	Jeff is counting	0.0
Jeff is counting	Because I am good	0.0
Because I am good	I ll make it hard on him	0.0
I ll make it hard on him	How many is he taking out	2.0
That was twelve	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
No	No I don t think so	0.0
No I don t think so	Yeah I think he took one more extra	3.0
Yeah I think he took one more extra	I think he took an extra one at least	1.0
I think he took an extra one at least	He took an extra every single time	2.0
Okay what will I write here to say he just   took twelve out	A little minus by the twelve	3.0
Now at this point are  there more of those pieces of glass in the bag uh or fewer  than when Amy Lynn said  Go	There is less	3.0
There is less	Less	1.0
Less	Fewer	1.0
Fewer	Less	1.0
How many less	Five	3.0
Does everyone agree with that	Yes I do	1.0
Somebody come and   write it	Seven minus twelve equals five	4.0
Uh Matt would you come and write that	Sure	0.0
Sure	They can hear you you know	0.0
Can I change it a little bit	Go ahead	0.0
We want it to say there are five less in the bag okay	Uh huh	0.0
Brian you want to come and   try it	Can I I	0.0
Can I I	to erase that	0.0
Is it okay that we change it that  way	I believe it s okay	0.0
Jeffery would you say go	Go	0.0
How many	One	0.0
Are there more in the bag now or fewer than when Jeffery   said go	More	3.0
More	One more	1.0
One more	One more	1.0
So if I wanted to write that ld say this	Say eighteen	3.0
It says that he counted one in	Yeah but since I said go	0.0
One more than  what	Than there were	3.0
Than there were when	When Amy Lynn said go	3.0
When Amy Lynn said go	No	0.0

Jim has 1 fewer tennis ball than Don	How many  tennis balls does Don have	0.0
And now Jim has Jim has 1  fewer	Two	3.0
What does that make	Two	3.0
Okay so Jim has three has  tennis balls and Don has how many more	Fewer	3.0
Fewer	It s two	3.0
You think that s two	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It s one fewer	3.0
It s one fewer	Two	3.0
You think it s two	Yeah	0.0
Jim has one fewer  Think	Jim has one fewer	0.0
So what does that make Don	Two	3.0
Jim has one fewer than Don	Fewer fewer fewer fewer fewer	0.0
Fewer fewer fewer fewer fewer	Four	3.0
Four	One	1.0
Try  to look for how many Don has	Five	3.0
Jim has one fewer than Don so what does that make Don  have	That makes Don have four	3.0
Let s  see if Jim has three does he have one fewer than Don	Yeah	0.0
So then how many tennis balls does Don have	Four	3.0
What did you have to  do with the three and one to get that answer	Um I put three	3.0
You have to add it	I took three and put one more	4.0
I took three and put one more	So I added	4.0
And now does Jim have one fewer than Don if Don  has four	Yes	0.0
Okay	Dad has 3 chickens	0.0
Dad has 3 chickens	If Grandpa sells 3 chickens he will  have as many as Dad	0.0
If Grandpa sells 3 chickens he will  have as many as Dad	How many chickens does Grandpa  have	0.0
How many chickens does Grandpa  have	Six	4.0
Six	He sells three he will have as many  as Dad	4.0
He sells three he will have as many  as Dad	So he must have six	4.0
So he must have six	Okay	0.0
Okay	But Dad has	0.0
But Dad has	Dad has three	3.0
Dad has three	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So if Grandpa had six and you take away three it would  equal	3.0
So if Grandpa had six and you take away three it would  equal	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Three	That means six	4.0
That means six	It s six	4.0
It s six	Six	4.0
Six	So that means three plus three equals six	4.0
So that means three plus three equals six	I don t do it that way	1.0

Six minus	So it would be two	3.0
You changed your minds	Because we put a minus	4.0
Because we put a minus	Minus	1.0
Okay and how did you do that	We we	0.0
Okay see the problem a little different now	Yeah	0.0
Can you tell me how you did that	We just flipped it around	3.0
We just flipped it around	It s  two	3.0
So What does this look like	An H	3.0
How many rods do I have here	Five	3.0
What does this now look like for you	A chain or a necklace or something	3.0
suppose it stands up	A building	3.0
A building	Like a tower	3.0
If its stand what would you call it	A building	3.0
In this particular case what would you call this if we called this a ladder	A step	3.0
Ok so how many steps do we have	Two	3.0
Could that also be a ladder	Yes	0.0
How many steps	One	3.0
Rather rods we call it	Five	3.0
And how many	eight	3.0
So my question to you is that how many would that be if we had  rods how many would we need to build a ladder with 10 steps	Wow three steps	3.0
Wow three steps	Ah I got an idea	0.0
Ah I got an idea	I got it	0.0
I got it	Thirtyfour	3.0
For ten	For ten	0.0
You also have the same number	Thirtyfour	3.0
Thirtyfour	Yeah	0.0
How do you	Five	4.0
Five	I counted how many rods it is and then I just multiplied by two because five times two is ten	4.0
I counted how many rods it is and then I just multiplied by two because five times two is ten	It was seventeen rods so seventeen times two is thirtyfour	4.0
You are so fast for me	OK I did five steps and then I counted how many rods that was	4.0
OK I did five steps and then I counted how many rods that was	It was seventeen and since five is half of ten five times two is ten so I just multiplied the number of rods by two and I got thirtyfour for seventeen rods	4.0
So how would you get for hundred then	Four hundred	0.0
Four hundred	Two sixtytwo	3.0
Two sixtytwo	I got two hundred and sixtytwo	3.0
I got two hundred and sixtytwo	There is an announcement over the PA system	0.0
There is an announcement over the PA system	I got one thousand three hundred and sixty	3.0
I got one thousand three hundred and sixty	I just do this by times eighty	3.0
How many you got	Thirteen sixty	3.0
We have to find a way to figure this out whether it is right or wrong	It is right	3.0
It can t be that for a hundred	Look ten is thirtyfour and ten times ten is one hundred so thirtyfour times ten is three hundred and forty   let me write that   OK then three hundred and forty times four which would be three hundred forty equals one hundred rods so three hundred and forty times four would be one thousand three hundred and sixty	4.0
What is that four	The hundreds	3.0
The hundreds	I got a different one	1.0
I got a different one	which is eighty so I had to multiply seventeen times eighty	1.0
What is that thirtyfour comes from	That is thirtyfour rods you would use to make ten steps	3.0
Then you are multiplying by	By ten because ten times ten is one hundred	4.0
Yeah	So thirtyfour times ten is three hundred and forty	4.0
Yeah	And for four hundred it would be three hundred and forty times four since three hundred and forty would be one hundred steps so one hundred times four is four hundred	4.0
What is that four come from	The one hundred times four	3.0
What is that four	The steps	3.0
But I am asking for a hundred steps	What	0.0
We are saying for a hundred right	You said four hundred	3.0
No I said for a hundred a hundred	Oh	0.0
I am sorry did you understand four hundred	Yeah	0.0
I am sorry I meant a hundred	Oh three hundred and forty	3.0
Three hundred and forty	Yeah	0.0
So you re saying so how would you do for eight	For eight	0.0
So why did you pick thirtyfour	Because um ten steps is thirtyfour	4.0
How would you do for four how would you do for eight	For eight	0.0
Using the same idea	What	0.0
What	Eight what	2.0
A ladder with eight steps	One two three four five six seven eight	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight	Ah here I go	0.0
Ah here I go	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twenty four twentyfive twentysix	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twenty four twentyfive twentysix	Ahh	0.0
Ahh	One two three four five six seven eight	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight	How the heck	0.0
How the heck	Any questions	0.0
So how many did you find	Because the four steps  One two three four	0.0
Because the four steps  One two three four	One two three four	0.0
One two three four	Take this whole thing off right	3.0
Take this whole thing off right	Do you know an easier way	0.0
Do you know an easier way	You have four steps right	3.0
You have four steps right	One two three four	0.0
One two three four	Now one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	0.0
How many is that	So the rods   you multiply by two	3.0
So the rods   you multiply by two	But when you add four more you add three more steps for each one	4.0
But when you add four more you add three more steps for each one	So for another step that s three blocks for another step there that s three blocks and that equals twelve so fourteen plus twelve is twenty six	4.0
So for another step that s three blocks for another step there that s three blocks and that equals twelve so fourteen plus twelve is twenty six	Nice	0.0
Nice	So these two must be wrong	3.0
So these two must be wrong	Which one	2.0
Which one	Oh the ten one	2.0
Oh the ten one	Then you d have to multiply that by thirty	4.0
Then you d have to multiply that by thirty	Yeah I had to multiply that by thirty and then divide it by five which is that six and then seventeen times six	4.0
Yeah I had to multiply that by thirty and then divide it by five which is that six and then seventeen times six	And that s how you get the answer	0.0
Are we sure that it s right now	Three twelve	3.0
Three twelve	I got to go at 330 Or else I ll be stuck	0.0
I got to go at 330 Or else I ll be stuck	How many steps we got One two three four five six seven eight nine ten	0.0
Which one you are doing now	Thirty I give up man	3.0
Thirty what	Thirtytwo	3.0
Thirtytwo for what	For this one the ten steps	3.0
You have got ten steps there	Yeah	0.0
So thirtytwo and how many you said you had for a hundred	For a hundred steps three hundred and forty so it will be three twenty	4.0
What do you do here to get a hundred	Eh	0.0
What did you do to get the number of rods for a ladder with ten and then hundred	Oh a ladder with ten	0.0
Oh a ladder with ten	I just did five and then I multiplied and we have seventeen rods and then I did that again and it was thirtyfour	4.0
I just did five and then I multiplied and we have seventeen rods and then I did that again and it was thirtyfour	So then I went over here and thirtyfour times ten	4.0
Where is this thirtyfour come from	The rods	3.0
The rods	It is wrong	3.0
It is wrong	It is thirtytwo	3.0
We have to find a way to be able to tell how many rods no matter what number of steps	I don t know now	0.0
I don t know now	I just noticed like I just multiplied by two and subtract two	3.0
Say for eight what would you do then for eight	For eight	0.0
Using that multiply by two what would you do	It d be fourteen for four then times two	3.0
Why don t you write it down	That is twenty eight then just minus two is twenty six because that is the real one twentysix	4.0
So why fourteen	Because there is fourteen rods for four	4.0
For fourOh four so I ask you about eight	First I did that and then since four times two is eight because you multiply it by two	4.0
So how about for sixteen	Sixteen	0.0
Hmm	It will twentysix plus twentysix is twelve it s fiftytwo	4.0
Where does that twentysix come from	The number of these	3.0
The number of these	No	0.0
No	That s wrong	3.0
That s wrong	It is fifty	3.0
I don t get this	Because here for eight times two is sixteen	4.0
Because here for eight times two is sixteen	So one is twentysix so I multiplied twentysix by two and I got fiftytwo so then I subtracted two it is fifty	4.0
Are you saying you multiplied here	Huh	2.0
Did you multiply here	Yeah	0.0
Can you write here	I did it over here	0.0
I did it over here	Twentysix twentysix	3.0
Oh twentysix times two and go on go on and what do you get	Twentysix times two is fifty two and I am subtracting two minus two and that is fifty	4.0
So that works all the time	Yeah	0.0
So we try for seven	Seven	0.0
Yeah	Hold on man	0.0
Before we do it can we find using this how will you do it	Using what	2.0
Using what	That	2.0
Yeah	Seven right	0.0
Seven right	for six	0.0
For seven	OK for seven	0.0
OK for seven	For eight it is twentysix	4.0
For eight it is twentysix	So for that I would add three that is twentynine	4.0
So for that I would add three that is twentynine	Twentythree	3.0
Twentythree	Twentynine	3.0
Twentynine	Oh yeah yeah	0.0
Oh yeah yeah	Twentythree twentythree	3.0
So how many you have for seven	I subtracted three from twentysix	3.0
Well but you are doing differently now right	Yeah	0.0
Because here you are doing like this you are multiplying   so if I give you like a ladder for a certain number of steps then how you go about computing that   finding out the number of rods if you did not want to build them	I take half of the number if it has a half I will multiply it by two and subtract two	4.0
So like for ten how would you do that	I think a ladder of five then count the rods multiply that by two and subtract two	4.0
How would you do that for nine	For nine I would do eight then I would multiply the number by two and then I would subtract two and then I would add three	4.0
You divide the number in half	Eight right	3.0
Yeah	I will take half of eight that is four	4.0
I will take half of eight that is four	I will make a ladder with four steps I will count the rods and then I will multiply the number of rods by two and then from that answer that I got from multiplying the number of rods by two I will subtract two	4.0
So you can do that for any number of steps	For numbers that do not have half I will take the closest number and then do half and then subtract two and then add three	4.0
So like for nine what would be the closest number	I will go to eight	3.0
Huh huh	I will subtract   or I can go to ten if I wanted to or what ever is easier	3.0
Huh huh	So I will go to eight take half is four count the rods multiply by two subtract two and then add three	4.0
Wow can you write it out	Can t I just show you	0.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
So can you write that out then we can keep talking about that	How many numbers you are trying to get when you multiply by two	2.0
How many numbers you are trying to get when you multiply by two	I got to leave at threethirty	0.0
He is writing he seems to have two ways of doing about it	For odd numbers I go to the nearest even number and take 1 2 of that even number count the rods for a ladder with that many steps multiply it by two subtract two and add three	4.0
For odd numbers I go to the nearest even number and take 1 2 of that even number count the rods for a ladder with that many steps multiply it by two subtract two and add three	Now I will show you	0.0
Now I will show you	Say nine it is odd	4.0
Say nine it is odd	I go to the even number eight	4.0
I go to the even number eight	And take half of eight equals four	4.0
And take half of eight equals four	I would make a ladder of four and then I would count  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	4.0
I would make a ladder of four and then I would count  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen	Then I multiply fourteen which is the number of rods times two because four times two equals eight gives me twenty eight and then I subtract two will give me twentysix and then I would add three	4.0
Then I multiply fourteen which is the number of rods times two because four times two equals eight gives me twenty eight and then I subtract two will give me twentysix and then I would add three	Because for every new thingy it is three rods and it will give me twenty nine	4.0
Because for every new thingy it is three rods and it will give me twenty nine	I am the winner	0.0
That is for odd numbers right	Yeah	0.0
And for even numbers you want to write for even numbers	You just killed my	0.0
You can write here	You killed my happiness	0.0
Your handwriting is good	multiply by three to get your answer then subtract one	4.0
multiply by three to get your answer then subtract one	For even numbers I take half of that number and make a ladder oops I messed up with that I got a lot of homework now and I got to go to Karate many steps	4.0
For even numbers I take half of that number and make a ladder oops I messed up with that I got a lot of homework now and I got to go to Karate many steps	Then I multiply the number of rods of that ladder by two then I subtract two	4.0
Then I multiply the number of rods of that ladder by two then I subtract two	That s it	0.0
That s it	Here it is subtract by two	4.0
Here it is subtract by two	Eight	4.0
Eight	Half of eight	4.0
Half of eight	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	I did this for the last one	0.0
I did this for the last one	Six	4.0
Six	Half of six equals three	4.0
Half of six equals three	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven	4.0
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven	That equals eleven rods	4.0
That equals eleven rods	Times two is twentytwo	4.0
That s for how many rods	Huh	0.0
Keep going	Minus two is twenty	3.0
That is for how many steps	Six	3.0
Is that right what we have done	I hope I am right	0.0

Eight zero	Yeah yeah	0.0
Last time you understood four hundred	I know what you are saying	0.0
I know what you are saying	Four	3.0
Four	Didn t I do this on the other paper	0.0
You did for eight	I know I know that s what I am saying	0.0
I know I know that s what I am saying	OK it is twentysix	3.0
OK it is twentysix	Twentysix times ten I didn t even get one man	0.0
Twentysix times ten I didn t even get one man	I didn t get even a single juice	0.0
You are saying for eighty right	Yes	0.0
How many you have	Two hundred sixty	3.0
How did you do it	What I did was eight rods	3.0
Which one of the two rules did you use	The Evens	3.0
Take that number divide it by half right	Yeah	0.0
Did you do that for eighty	For who	0.0
Eighty is an odd even number right	No because   yeah yeah and then I subtract two from this	3.0
No because   yeah yeah and then I subtract two from this	Two fiftyeight	3.0
What I am trying to say	Look this is what I did	0.0
Look this is what I did	OK	0.0
Is eighty an even number or not	Yeah	0.0
So how can you do that	Because for eight rods it is twentysix	3.0
Twentysix	So that represents eight and eight times ten is eighty so it is twentysix times ten equals two hundred and sixty and minus two equals two hundred and fiftyeight	4.0
How about for a hundred and twenty	Eh	0.0
A hundred and twenty	I just hate that	0.0
One two zero	Six that is sixty times two	3.0
Six that is sixty times two	I got you	0.0
I got you	So twenty that will be six times ten will be my sixty and twenty times two is two hundred minus the two is one hundred and ninety eight and that will be my sixty times two	4.0
I don t see half of one twenty	Huh	0.0
In your rule you said you will do half of that one twenty	Yeah	0.0
Half is sixty	I know	0.0
So how are you going to do it	I did	0.0
I did	This six times ten is sixty	4.0
This six times ten is sixty	My sixty is two hundred and two hundred minus two equals one hundred and ninetyeight so this is my sixty	4.0
My sixty is two hundred and two hundred minus two equals one hundred and ninetyeight so this is my sixty	And then my sixty times two is	4.0
Thirty	Three hundred and ninesix minus   Wait a minute	3.0
Three hundred and ninesix minus   Wait a minute	Did I do my math right	0.0
Did I do my math right	What	0.0
What	We did not need to hear that	0.0
We did not need to hear that	Let me just finish this problem real quick	0.0
Let me just finish this problem real quick	OK nine times two is eighteen plus one is nineteen	4.0
OK nine times two is eighteen plus one is nineteen	OK OK Then subtract two is three hundred ninety four	4.0
OK OK Then subtract two is three hundred ninety four	I am nice	0.0
Ariel the rule that you came up with was that you take that number divide by two is that right	Yeah	0.0
So if we divide one hundred and twenty by two what do you get	Sixty	3.0
And then you build that ladder with that many steps	Yeah	0.0
And then you said multiply by two right	Yeah	0.0
Where is that sixty	One hundred and ninetyeight	3.0
I don t see that one twenty that I told you about	Because this is what I did	0.0
Because this is what I did	Twenty is the six six times ten is sixty	4.0
Twenty is the six six times ten is sixty	That would be the two hundred	4.0
Six times what	Six times ten is sixty	4.0
Hmm hmm	Two hundred is right here then I subtracted two and make it one ninety eight and so sixty is one ninety eight	4.0
What are you trying to say	Rods	3.0
You are saying that sixty is one twenty eight	No one ninety eight	3.0
And how did you get that one ninety eight for sixty	I did twenty which would be six steps is twenty rods	4.0
I did twenty which would be six steps is twenty rods	Six times ten is sixty so twenty rods times ten is two hundred and through my rule you subtract it by two to get one ninety eight and then	4.0
Up to here you are getting the number for sixty right	This is sixty	3.0
Six is an even number right	Yeah yeah yeah	0.0
So did you do the same rule of dividing by two	Yeah I divide one twenty by two and got sixty	4.0
OK you go ahead	You are wrong right there because	3.0
QuicklyOK	OK	0.0
So we can look at the rule that you have here I am really looking for a rule that can help me figure out	Should I write this whole thing here	0.0
Yeah	Done	0.0
Right Ariel	My rule is right	3.0
So we know for how many rods for the ladder for one twenty eight steps	Here we go half as sixty yah yah	4.0
Here we go half as sixty yah yah	Six times ten is sixty ahh ahh	4.0
Six times ten is sixty ahh ahh	For six steps equals too many rods and then six times ten is sixty so two hundred and	4.0
Where is the ladder with sixty steps	I didn t do that	0.0
I didn t do that	It is too much	0.0
It is too much	I shortened it by dividing sixty by ten it gives me six	4.0
I shortened it by dividing sixty by ten it gives me six	Since I had already done six six times ten is sixty so I just did the number rods for sixty times ten	4.0
Since I had already done six six times ten is sixty so I just did the number rods for sixty times ten	So that I didn t have to make a big ol  ladder	4.0
Did you subtract by two	What	0.0
Here did you subtract by two	It is right here	0.0
This is   One ninety eight is what again	The sixty	3.0
I see	What s this	0.0
What s this	Ohh I put nine	3.0
Ohh I put nine	That s two that s supposed to be a two my bad	3.0
That s two that s supposed to be a two my bad	Two	3.0
How will you do for one twentyfive	The Odd rule	3.0
Yeah	I will go to one twentyfour which is   I got a one twentyfourrrrr  wait wait what am I doing it is seventytwo I believe no no don t think that  sixty two   hah hah hah	3.0
I will go to one twentyfour which is   I got a one twentyfourrrrr  wait wait what am I doing it is seventytwo I believe no no don t think that  sixty two   hah hah hah	I m smart	0.0
I m smart	Yeah sixtytwo	3.0
How many you got	It is sixtytwo half of one twentyfour	3.0
For one twenty five	I have to figure that out	0.0
Yeah can you figure that out	I doubt it	0.0
I doubt it	Let me see if this is	0.0
The rule is here	My rule uh my perfet rule I have to set it up for this huge thing	0.0
One twentyfour steps	No this is two right here	3.0
No this is two right here	One two three four five six seven eight	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight	For sixty it is one hundred and ninetyeight add two it is two hundred	4.0
For sixty it is one hundred and ninetyeight add two it is two hundred	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	No we add six oh	3.0
No we add six oh	One two three four five six seven eight	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	One hundred ninetyeight	0.0
One hundred ninetyeight	One ninetynine two hundred twootwo twoothree twoofour and twoosix	0.0
One ninetynine two hundred twootwo twoothree twoofour and twoosix	Two hundred and six rods	3.0
You do a lot in your head I just cannot follow you	One twenty five rounded to the nearest even number it could be one twenty four or one twenty six I did one twentyfour	4.0
OK	Then one twenty four divided by two is sixty two	4.0
How did you find out OK	Sixty is	4.0
Sixty is	I went back to my recent observations sixty is one hundred ninety eight and then I made these two steps which gave me eight more rods which makes it one hundred   two hundred and six rods	4.0
I went back to my recent observations sixty is one hundred ninety eight and then I made these two steps which gave me eight more rods which makes it one hundred   two hundred and six rods	Now we shall multiply	4.0
Now we shall multiply	Fourten	4.0
You went back to what	One twentyfour	3.0
Then what did you do next	I did half of one twentyfour	3.0
Then what did you do with that sixtytwo	Two right	3.0
Sixtytwo	Yeah I know sixtytwo	0.0
Yeah I know sixtytwo	I subtracted two and since I had already done   You subtracted two from what	3.0
I subtracted two and since I had already done   You subtracted two from what	From sixty two	3.0
Ah huh	Since I had already done how many rods sixty has I just went back here look here it is one hundred and ninety eight rods and I made one for two and it gave me eight rods and then I added eight rods to one hundred and ninety eight	4.0
So you are saying you added eight to what	Eight rods to my other rods one hundred ninetyeight	3.0
Let s think so you are saying going from sixty to sixty two you added eight rods right is that what you are saying	Yeah What	2.0
You said   basically you are trying to tell me that   you are trying to find for sixtytwo	Yes	0.0
You went down to sixty right	Yeah	0.0
You know how many are in sixty and you are adding two ladders right	Yeah	0.0
Is that what you are saying	A ladder with two steps so I counted	3.0
We know two has eight right	Yeah	0.0
But six how many six has	Eight times three	3.0
Can you put for six	Six steps	0.0
Yeah	Oh my God	0.0
Oh my God	Have mercy on me	0.0
Have mercy on me	Oh messed up	3.0
Oh messed up	Ta ta ta	0.0
Ta ta ta	There you are happy	0.0
So how many steps do we have	Six	3.0
And how many do we have	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty	0.0
A ladder of two how many do they have	Yeah	0.0
So you write eight you get what	Twentyeight	3.0
So let s see whether eight has twentyeight	Wait a minute I have twentysix	3.0
So then what we are going to do	Go to my rule minus two	3.0
Go to my rule minus two	Twentysix	3.0
I am finding hard to follow	I need to go home	0.0
I need to go home	Here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twentyfour twentyfive	0.0
Here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twentythree twentyfour twentyfive	Ooh Ooh I am right	0.0
Ooh Ooh I am right	I am right twentysix	3.0
I am right twentysix	Tut tut toon	0.0
Tut tut toon	I got to be out of here	0.0
So is this right or wrong	It is right	3.0
It is right	I did the same thing for this how I did this and it is right	3.0
I did the same thing for this how I did this and it is right	I just did it right now	0.0
I just did it right now	I m right	3.0
What does it have to do with the ladder	With the ladder	0.0
Hmph	Because James I don t know how he did it but I do it because James was right so I told you	1.0
No you subtract two in your rule you always talk about subtracting two	Because before when I would just multiply by two and then I noticed that I was wrong	4.0
Because before when I would just multiply by two and then I noticed that I was wrong	I was off by two so I just starting subtracting two or	4.0
But you would do that for any number whether it is odd or even you do all that	No just   Wait yeah yeah yeah odd or even and then for een anh anh een aa	3.0
Lets go to Nathan	We came up with a diagram with a bunch of numbers and equations on it	3.0
Lets go to Julian	We also said diagram but like pictures on it	3.0
All right so  Kelsey	Figure	3.0
Lets go Keilty	A graph	3.0
And lets go here Danny	A chart	3.0
Go ahead	Put it here	0.0
And Rebecca Im actually going to	The greater the slant length per difference in the diameters equals a larger roll radius	4.0
The greater the slant length per difference in the diameters equals a larger roll radius	Okay so I kind of just tried and solve the whole thing but basically I found that if you multiply the slant times the wide diameter you get two times the roll radius and I tried that three times and it worked for three	4.0
Okay so I kind of just tried and solve the whole thing but basically I found that if you multiply the slant times the wide diameter you get two times the roll radius and I tried that three times and it worked for three	The E Cup E it didnt work and I wasnt sure why but the other three worked	4.0
The E Cup E it didnt work and I wasnt sure why but the other three worked	So I wasnt sure  She did say to think about if the slight hand  slight  slant height was adjusted so I dont know if that would change the equation	4.0
So I wasnt sure  She did say to think about if the slight hand  slight  slant height was adjusted so I dont know if that would change the equation	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you multiplied which  What by what	2.0
So you multiplied which  What by what	The slant length times the wide diameter and youd get two times the roll radius	4.0
The slant length times the wide diameter and youd get two times the roll radius	So I dont know how to factor in the narrow diameter	2.0
So I dont know how to factor in the narrow diameter	So two times the roll radius	3.0
So two times the roll radius	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But then youd need to know the roll radius before	3.0
But then youd need to know the roll radius before	Yeah	1.0
So thats what youre trying to find	Ten point	3.0
Ten point	Its point nine nine	1.0
Its point nine nine	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Or  yeah	1.0
Or  yeah	Okay and then for	0.0
Okay and then for	Thats for wide right	3.0
Thats for wide right	Yeah for wide	1.0
Yeah for wide	And then for the wide for B it would be  942	3.0
And then for the wide for B it would be  942	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	9424 something like that	3.0
9424 something like that	Okay	1.0
Okay	Okay	1.0
Okay	For C the wide diameter	3.0
For C the wide diameter	Okay so note the similarities within groups and	3.0
Okay so note the similarities within groups and	Yeah so compare them	1.0
Yeah so compare them	So for A the wide diameter is three and a half and so is like for F And then they both have the same slant length	4.0
So for A the wide diameter is three and a half and so is like for F And then they both have the same slant length	But A has a narrow diameter of three and then F has two	4.0
But A has a narrow diameter of three and then F has two	And A has a much larger roll radius so maybe that affects how it works	4.0
And A has a much larger roll radius so maybe that affects how it works	And if	0.0
And if	Wait so the narrow diameter	0.0
Because the circumference  if you calculate the circumference it might just be a lot of extra work	Something like that	3.0
Something like that	Do you think we could use that to make our equation like the area of the cup	1.0
Do you think we could use that to make our equation like the area of the cup	Like the area or the volume	3.0
Like the area or the volume	The volume like so how much water it holds	1.0
The volume like so how much water it holds	Yeah but what if this holds the same volume as like this but this one is less  like not  it doesnt have like a slant	2.0
Yeah but what if this holds the same volume as like this but this one is less  like not  it doesnt have like a slant	Never mind	0.0
Never mind	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Im just trying to think of a formula	0.0
Im just trying to think of a formula	It could be a relationship between area and volume	3.0
It could be a relationship between area and volume	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah thats what I was trying to say	1.0
Yeah thats what I was trying to say	Like not independent	3.0
Like not independent	The wide diameter for A F H because they all have the same wide diameter	4.0
The wide diameter for A F H because they all have the same wide diameter	Oh yeah three and a half	1.0
Oh yeah three and a half	So the circumference is 1099	3.0
So the circumference is 1099	She said we shouldnt look at the circumference	0.0
She said we shouldnt look at the circumference	So okay	0.0
So okay	For H theres no narrow diameter and the slant length is three and three fourths and then the roll radius is three and three fourths	4.0
For H theres no narrow diameter and the slant length is three and three fourths and then the roll radius is three and three fourths	So H wait H would be a cone right	3.0
So H wait H would be a cone right	Mmhmm	1.0
Mmhmm	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay and	0.0
Okay and	Yes I think yours is  like yours definitely has a pattern but I dont think its correct	1.0
Yes I think yours is  like yours definitely has a pattern but I dont think its correct	Theres still a lot of outliers	3.0
Theres still a lot of outliers	Want to just calculate the rest to see how that	0.0
Want to just calculate the rest to see how that	Only F and G or all of them	2.0
Only F and G or all of them	Well F and G these  we already know that these two dont  these three dont add up	1.0
Well F and G these  we already know that these two dont  these three dont add up	Okay	0.0
Okay	Are you doing F	0.0
Are you doing F	Ill do F	0.0
Ill do F	Okay	0.0
Have you hit a wall	Yeah	0.0
You can do this	Yeah whenever you include like both its bigger	3.0
Yeah whenever you include like both its bigger	So put in return	0.0
So put in return	Roll radius	3.0
Roll radius	A slight difference	3.0
A slight difference	over 125	3.0
over 125	between the top and bottom diameter	3.0
between the top and bottom diameter	Five point wait   five and three fourths	3.0
Five point wait   five and three fourths	575	3.0
575	creates a larger roll radius	3.0
creates a larger roll radius	multiplied by R	3.0
multiplied by R	Yeah that makes sense	1.0
Yeah that makes sense	Then you want to leave space for diagrams too	0.0
Then you want to leave space for diagrams too	Okay	0.0
Okay	So Im just going to box this off so I can put the equation here	0.0
So Im just going to box this off so I can put the equation here	We dont have plenty of space there	0.0
Part of it yeah	Why cant we have the slant length of the cone	0.0
For each	Mmhmm	0.0
And so for this one	Mmhmm	0.0
But because its not a cone were missing this little piece down here	Right	0.0
Right	Mmhmm	0.0
Okay where would the tip of the cone be	The same place	3.0
You guys feel like you have a greater starting point	Maybe	0.0
Maybe	Maybe	0.0
Maybe	And also	0.0
Yeah	Im realizing so were back to like trying to find the pattern where if you multiply slant length times the wide diameter you get double the roll radius but only for four of them	4.0
So if it only works for four of them would that be   would it be a valid solution	No	0.0
So you can test it using all of these values	Okay	0.0
Mmhmm	If you make this 99	3.0
Yep	its 100 inches	3.0
its 100 inches	But if we make this 999 it goes to 1000 inches	4.0
Well think about it what happens when you add that 9	A zero is added on	3.0
A zero is added on	Yeah but you make it	1.0
A zero is added on but what happens to	more similar to the wide diameter	3.0
So what does that mean about the comparison of the wide and narrow diameter	Its very important and it changes the radius	3.0
It changes the what	It changes the roll radius	3.0
So if I have a really really large wide diameter and a really really small narrow diameter how does that change the roll radius	It makes it smaller which means it cant go as far	4.0
Now you guys have an example of when the narrow diameter is zero	So its like a triangle I think this way	3.0
Whats a threedimensional word for it	A pyramid	3.0
A pyramid	A cone	1.0
Because you have to account for that missing cone part	Yeah	0.0
How would you account for that	Do you like add on that volume  or area to it and	3.0
Do you like add on that volume  or area to it and	I dont know	2.0
So so draw a picture and youll be able to kind of see okay	So like this	3.0
So like this	And you have to take away this smaller triangle	3.0
Mmhmm	which is like	0.0
which is like	When you  when you find the equation would you just add on this part of it	3.0
So the whole equation will have to do with this whole image you have	Okay	0.0
So the roll radius when I have a zero as the narrow diameter is equal to what	The slant height	3.0
So that means because my roll radius for this cup is not equal to my slant height correct	Mmhmm	0.0
Its equal to my slant height and then I also have to account for all the way down right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So how do I find that	2.0
So how do I find that	Its like similar triangles	3.0
And if so you guys can find the error and fix it that will help guide you towards what you need	Okay	0.0
You good Max	Yeah	0.0
So its again its just a status poster so Im not looking for solutions yet	Okay	0.0
Okay	Do we have to fill this out	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
But this can kind of guide and almost help you come to a different conclusion based off of what they found	Okay	0.0
So Gerry  it looks like you kind of have a better step than Gerry but he still has some insight	Do we have to like write it down	0.0
Yeah Id write it down because whatever you dont write down now youre going to have to	Is it recommended or is it	0.0
Yes	But is it	0.0
Like strongly recommended	But like do we have to do it	0.0
But like do we have to do it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Lets do it	0.0
Lets do it	Ready	0.0
Ready	Is it mandatory	0.0
Im going to let you decide that	Okay so we used Heathers	0.0
My group of winners	and guessed what the  we didnt like guess but we found what the question mark would be	3.0
So you used Heather	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So we saw this and we were like Oh lets find what the question mark would be	4.0
So we saw this and we were like Oh lets find what the question mark would be	And its the wide diameter	4.0
So what is the W then	The wide diameter	3.0
So why would she put two different variables for the same thing	What do you mean	2.0
So you said the question mark is the wide diameter	Oh yeah no	0.0
Oh yeah no	So like I dont think she knew what it actually was but we found out that the one that works is	1.0
I see what youre saying okay	is the wide diameter	3.0
She knew that there was something that had to be multiplied but she didnt know what number it was	Yeah	0.0
Now did you also take into account Gerry and Judi	We looked at Judis and thats kind of what we were thinking	0.0
Okay	but	0.0
All right	Okay	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Here	0.0
Mmhmm	So one of them it was going like one three one four one five one six	4.0
So one of them it was going like one three one four one five one six	So for this one we did four four four five four six four seven	4.0
So for this one we did four four four five four six four seven	Does that make sense	0.0
So youre using the numbers but if you didnt have the numbers what would you say is changing	So you want us to look at like the actual data	3.0
And the W stands for the	The wide	3.0
Whats happening with the wide diameter	Oh	0.0
Oh	Its  is it  are some of them skewed though like	3.0
Okay	Oh	0.0
Oh	Its increasing by one	3.0
So how would you describe what her strengths are	Okay	0.0
Okay yeah	Wait wait so real quick	0.0
Real quick	So do you want us to like go through and answer all these and then continue like I dont know like trying to	0.0
Trying to make the poster	Well like  Im still trying to like figure like  something out that like makes the  works a little bit	0.0
Well like  Im still trying to like figure like  something out that like makes the  works a little bit	Its so frustrating	0.0
Its so frustrating	This is like so close and then like so far away	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
So you know start to finish whats your status	Okay	0.0
And doesnt need to be spiffy but I do need to be able to see it from far away	Okay	0.0
So youre using the student work to answer these questions because	not a good answer	0.0
not a good answer	Lets see the	0.0
Lets see the	So you get R	3.0
So you get R	And solve for it	1.0
And solve for it	And see if it works	3.0
And see if it works	R plus three is R minus five over two	4.0
So what do we got here	Were drawing	0.0
No	We kind of stopped	0.0
Okay why did we stop	We started doing the poster and like giving each other ideas	0.0
Okay	And then we could label this	0.0
And then we could label this	We could say like  what do we want to call it	0.0
We could say like  what do we want to call it	We could call it like the invisible part	0.0
We could call it like the invisible part	Invisible cone	0.0
Invisible cone	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How about we say triangle	0.0
How about we say triangle	Invisible triangle	0.0
Invisible triangle	And we should label each of like the  so like this is W N S and  like like the lines on the side	0.0
And we should label each of like the  so like this is W N S and  like like the lines on the side	So W	0.0
So W	W is here	0.0
W is here	W	0.0
W	N	0.0
N	Oh right S	0.0
Oh right S	And like make the	0.0
And like make the	Does it matter	0.0
Does it matter	line centered	3.0
line centered	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then this whole thing equals R You can use that if you want	3.0
And then this whole thing equals R You can use that if you want	Thats good	1.0
Thats good	Okay	0.0
Okay	And then say like we have this as X	3.0
And then say like we have this as X	Or like	0.0
Or like	The tip	3.0
The tip	R minus S on this part	3.0
R minus S on this part	R minus S yes	1.0
R minus S yes	And what else do we want to put on this	2.0
And what else do we want to put on this	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I think thats fine	0.0
I think thats fine	I think we should write this  this triangle is similar to that one	3.0
I think we should write this  this triangle is similar to that one	Thats what were trying to do	0.0
Thats what were trying to do	Like similar triangles	1.0
Like similar triangles	Yeah so we have to label more corners	0.0
Yeah so we have to label more corners	So	0.0
So	Label like	0.0
Label like	Can we do A B C D	0.0
Can we do A B C D	A B C D	0.0

Im going to put a timer on for two and a half minutes	All right lets put seven	3.0
All right lets put seven	Seven E	1.0
Seven E	Okay were done	0.0
Posters need to be on the board	So we need to say like this big triangle is equal to the small triangle	3.0
So we need to say like this big triangle is equal to the small triangle	Well its similar its not	1.0
Well its similar its not	Oh its similar yeah	1.0
Oh its similar yeah	We can do that	0.0
We can do that	R over W equals the  like	3.0
R over W equals the  like	Well I think what she meant is we have to say like W is this N is this R minus S is this	0.0
Well I think what she meant is we have to say like W is this N is this R minus S is this	Okay	0.0
Okay	So we can do that	0.0
So we can do that	So we can say that S	0.0
Im kind of curious  what helps you remember Sarah	Uh that two thirds is larger	3.0
Erik	I remember that two wait three fourths is larger than two  thirds by one twelfth or two twentyfourths	4.0
Michael what do you  remember	I agree with Erik um because thats I remember three  fourths being bigger than it because the four wait I had three  light greens and then only two purples and the three light  greens were larger	4.0
Meredith	Ok what do we need	2.0
Ok what do we need	We need the uh two oranges and the purple	3.0
We need the uh two oranges and the purple	Yeah I remember two oranges and the purple	1.0
Yeah I remember two oranges and the purple	This was our  last one because I remember I was tracing on it	3.0
This was our  last one because I remember I was tracing on it	Oh yeah	1.0
Oh yeah	Two oranges one purple the browns I remember were the  thirds	3.0
Two oranges one purple the browns I remember were the  thirds	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And the halves were the	3.0
And the halves were the	We didnt need we didnt need halves remember	3.0
We didnt need we didnt need halves remember	I know but we did build em	1.0
I know but we did build em	I think it was the blacks or the dark greens	3.0
I think it was the blacks or the dark greens	Dark greens fourthed it	1.0
Dark greens fourthed it	Yeah	1.0

Gentlemen gentlemen	Ok thats the second one	0.0
Tell me what we have here	An orange and a red	3.0
An orange and a red	And purples for thirds	3.0
And purples for thirds	And three purples	1.0
And three purples	And light green for fourths	1.0
Ok right	And um here how I used to figure it out	0.0
And um here how I used to figure it out	Twelfths	3.0
Twelfths	Oh no those are singles	3.0
Honestly Erik I could imagine if you explained to me what  Im supposed to imagine	Ok	0.0
Ill try real hard but I ll try to imagine	Suppose there are twelfths under that	3.0
I can imagine that	And you took out two of those purples and three light greens	3.0
I could imagine	It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between  the between the um um	3.0
It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between  the between the um um	See	0.0
See	Two thirds and three fourths	3.0
I see that	And we came to up here	0.0
And we came to up here	So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth   Fig 5 Erik And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it  would be bigger by one twelfth or	4.0
So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth   Fig 5 Erik And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it  would be bigger by one twelfth or	Two twentyfourths	4.0
Two twentyfourths	Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the	4.0
Why is it a red here and why is it a white here	Well	0.0
Well	Well because see each model is different	4.0
In what way	Because this model is bigger than this model	4.0
Because this model is bigger than this model	Erik	0.0
Erik	You could put the reds on that model and make it  sixths	3.0
You could put the reds on that model and make it  sixths	But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that  model	2.0
But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that  model	Oh yeah youre right	1.0
Oh yeah youre right	So either its one twelfth or one  twentyfourths	3.0
So either its one twelfth or one  twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths	1.0
Two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths on this one	1.0
Two twentyfourths on this one	This is probably the only  model that can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd  have to halve each white to get twentyfourths there	4.0
This is probably the only  model that can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd  have to halve each white to get twentyfourths there	But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	2.0
But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	We tried that already	0.0
We tried that already	No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	1.0
You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three  oranges	Well I dont know exaT2ly but it would be a lot	3.0
Do you still expeT2 that you would get the same answer	Well we can divide it	3.0
Well we can divide it	Looking at this it would not be fiftieths	3.0
Why not	Im imagining a this  instead of the  purple there	3.0
Instead of the purple	It would take another six of those so it would only be  thirtieths	4.0
Id like you to try that other model	Three oranges	3.0
Id like you  to find a third model thinking big	Ok	0.0
Ok	We could think real big	0.0
And see what you come up if you work on that	Dr Martino said the key is think big so	0.0
Well maybe well see if it works	So now were gonna think real big	0.0

Can you third that	I thirded it	3.0
I thirded it	One two three and then plus nine other of those  which would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	4.0
One two three and then plus nine other of those  which would be one two three four five six seven eight nine	So its just like making a new rod	4.0
So its just like making a new rod	Fourthing it might be	3.0
Im not quite following that	Ok	0.0
Ok	I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones  which would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would  add one to there one to there and one to there which would  be three	4.0
I have the three of em and then I put nine other ones  which would equal another blue so if I thirded it I would  add one to there one to there and one to there which would  be three	And then four five six seven eight nine	4.0
And then four five six seven eight nine	So its like  adding another blue but Im making a new rod	4.0
Ok can you set that up in a different way	Well in thirds	3.0
Use the same pieces but can you set it up a little differently	Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the  three next to that and the three next to that	4.0
Oh I have an idea put the three next to that and then the  three next to that and the three next to that	Huh	2.0
Huh	Ill show you what I mean	0.0
So we have  a secret that we want to hear about we have a theory that  was being tested and then I know that um Andrews not  here	Yes he is but	0.0
Michael	Um if you know what youre doing and you know what  strategy you could probably build you could probably  build one for every single rod	3.0
What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what  you mean by that	You could you could build a thing you could build  fractions of every single rod if you know what youre doing  and you have a strategy or a secret that that you know will  work	3.0
What can be such a secret	Thats what I was trying to figure out	0.0
How many do you think	Well we got six	3.0
You think thats it	No	0.0
What do you think	Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you  divided the white rod maybe you could make more models  that way if you divided the white rods	4.0
So youre thinking if you had more different size rods	Yeah yeah	0.0
What  what do you think Mark	um I think  Im not that sure	0.0
What do you  think	Um there s a smaller one	3.0
Ok what do you think	I think its theyre right but one green and uh and a one I  think equals one purple because if you would put that to  that it would just equal one purple and put the	4.0
Erik is suggesting  above it	Yeah	0.0
Uh can you show us how that shows three quarters and two  thirds	Oh we dont have  We dont have thirds in there	3.0
oh ok	We only have the half and the whole	3.0
Graham you can come and help	I dont have fourths in my one that I made	3.0
Ok you want to tell the class about what you have  there	Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two  thirds and three fourths and we think that three fourths is  bigger by one twelfth	4.0
Whats one twelfth	Because um twelve whites equal up to this	4.0
Because um twelve whites equal up to this	Let me show  here	0.0
Are you all convinced	But didnt you say to make a smaller one	0.0
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	But I dont think thats the smallest one	3.0
What do you  think	Well we just put twelve whites on there and it takes one  white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple to  the three greens	4.0
Well we just put twelve whites on there and it takes one  white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple to  the three greens	So thats why we think its one twelfth	4.0
What do you think Erik	Smaller in sizewise	0.0
Smaller in sizewise	Like size for the thirds the fourths  and and the whole	3.0
Like size for the thirds the fourths  and and the whole	Smaller by size	3.0
Brian	Well um the orange and the red	3.0
Ok	We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller  one because every one you use equals up to an orange and a  red and the secret is that every one has three purples and  four greens	4.0
We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller  one because every one you use equals up to an orange and a  red and the secret is that every one has three purples and  four greens	And so you cant possibly make one smaller  because you wont be able to fit it wont work because  every one you make equals up equals up to the orange and  red	4.0
So youre telling me the six models that you made	Were the same length	3.0
Thats very interesting	Well well we could make another model to show that	3.0
You found different ways to show one that had the same  length as orange and red	Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact  same length as the other one	3.0
And what did what was how did she make her train	Yeah thats what I was going to do	1.0
Yeah thats what I was going to do	Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the  third is purple and the fourths were the dark greens were  the light greens	4.0
Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the  third is purple and the fourths were the dark greens were  the light greens	See thats what I did I was gonna make one that was the  same exact size	1.0
How would you convince me	Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the  part that theres no theres no other smaller	4.0
Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the  part that theres no theres no other smaller	I think because  at their model they use the twelfth as the white ones and  theres no rod smaller than the white rod	4.0
I think because  at their model they use the twelfth as the white ones and  theres no rod smaller than the white rod	So therefore if  you make it a rod smaller than it they cant you cant divide  it into twelfths	4.0
Yeah	Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod  possible	4.0
Ok so	Unless you made a new rod	3.0
So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that  had that were smaller than the white rods then you could  make a smaller model Erik	Yeah	0.0
Jessica is that reasonable to you	Yeah	1.0
Are there others	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I know I just did one	0.0
You have another one	Yeah	0.0
I would like one that uh is the next smallest	Next sma	0.0
Brian whats your prediction	I think it would be twentyfour	3.0
What rods	Well the next the next the next larger one will be I think  the whole will be twentyfour	3.0
But we we call the whole one	Yeah I know but what I mean	0.0
Yeah I know but what I mean	No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole	3.0
What would be what would be twentyfourths	Like the there would be there would take twentyfour  white cubes to equal up to a whole	3.0
Like the there would be there would take twentyfour  white cubes to equal up to a whole	I I also have a strategy	0.0
Wait wait a second youre saying twentyfour white ones  would equal your train	Yeah yeah	0.0
So then what would one  white one be called in that next model do you think	One twelfth	3.0
One twelfth	I think um	0.0
What would that white one be called	Well its not gonna were not gonna	0.0
Well its not gonna were not gonna	Let me see this	0.0
Let me see this	Um one twentyfourth I think	3.0
You think that too	Yeah Alan and I made that same model	1.0
Yeah Alan and I made that same model	We made the  same model that was I think it was two oranges and like  one purple yeah it was two oranges and one purple and  then it had the thirds	4.0
Is that what you had	I made that also	1.0
Ok can you leave the other one up  there maybe while youre making that	Sure we can	0.0
James why dont you make the other one too so it doesnt  go away on the bottom	Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	0.0
Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	2 more no  6 more	3.0
I would suggest you to make both models in your  seats and keep them in front of you	Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twenty four twentyfour here	4.0
Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twenty four twentyfour here	Youve got twentyfour plus twenty four is fortyeight	4.0
Youve got twentyfour plus twenty four is fortyeight	I need those	0.0
I need those	I need another red	3.0
I need another red	I need thirtysix whites	3.0
I need thirtysix whites	Thirtysix	0.0
Thirtysix	Why	2.0
Why	Why	2.0
Why	Why are you saying thirtysix	2.0
Why are you saying thirtysix	I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	0.0
I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	You can have all the reds you want	0.0
You can have all the reds you want	Im going to sit here  and watch you guys	0.0
Im going to sit here  and watch you guys	Were in battle	0.0
I see that you built a model that has two oranges  and a purple that youre calling one	Well I imagine the white ones	3.0
And youre imagining the whites and how many do you  imagine are there	Twentyfour	3.0
And how many do you have there Andrew	Um twentyfour whites	3.0
But you  built it too Amy how many do you have Amy	Twentyfour	3.0
Yes	Twentyfour	3.0
Because if youre not you  may want to go up and count them to be sure or go to  someone else who built the model and count them	I I built the model	0.0
Ok so Sarah and Beth you built one you dont have  enough	No	0.0
Ok do you  believe there are  Sarah and Beth	Yeah	1.0
That hes now going to give the white one the number  name what class	One twentyfourth	3.0
We know the white  one has number name one twentyfourth in that model	Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the  thirds	3.0
Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the  thirds	Yes mmm hmmm	1.0
Yes mmm hmmm	And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths  would do it	3.0
And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths  would do it	mmm hmmm	1.0
mmm hmmm	So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is  two whites and then people think the twelfths would be the  answer but if you take two of the twentyfourths	4.0
So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is  two whites and then people think the twelfths would be the  answer but if you take two of the twentyfourths	It would equal up to a red rod	1.0
It would equal up to a red rod	It would equal up to a red rod	1.0
It would equal up to a red rod	Which would be equal to twelfths	1.0
Which would be equal to twelfths	Which would be one twelfth	1.0
Which would be one twelfth	So see we think I think that  the answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	3.0
So see we think I think that  the answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	Mmm hmmm	1.0
How many of you agree with what they said	So there are two answers	3.0
So there are two answers	Both the same	3.0
I remember then some people had  written  do you have a question Amy	No I just want to say something	0.0
Ok	Um that but two reds equal up to a purple	3.0
So	So you could put six purples down to make	3.0
So you could put six purples down to make	What do you mean six purples	2.0
What do you mean six purples	Becau six purples because look	0.0
Becau six purples because look	Ok but why would you need the purples	2.0
Ok but why would you need the purples	Why would we need the purple	2.0
Why would we need the purple	Its only one twelfth	3.0
Its only one twelfth	I know but you could also do it that way	3.0
I know but you could also do it that way	You could also  put six	3.0
You could also  put six	Why would we need that	2.0
Why would we need that	We only need one twelfth	3.0
We only need one twelfth	Its either two twentyfourths or  one twelfth	3.0
Its either two twentyfourths or  one twelfth	Theyre both the same answer	1.0
Theyre both the same answer	Theyre both the same answer	1.0
Theyre both the same answer	I know	1.0
I know	But why would we need the purple	2.0
But why would we need the purple	The purple would be  too big	3.0
The purple would be  too big	Six purples equal up to the whole train you made	3.0
Six purples equal up to the whole train you made	But why do we need  we dont need sixths	3.0
But why do we need  we dont need sixths	We only need  thirds and fourths	3.0
We only need  thirds and fourths	Yeah why would we need that	2.0
Yeah why would we need that	And twelfths and twentyfourths	3.0
And twelfths and twentyfourths	Thats all we need	3.0
Thats all we need	Ok	0.0
Ok	I dont think we need sixths	3.0
But thats an  interesting thought that there is another way and when you  think about all those purples there what number name  would you give to a purple then	One sixth	3.0
Which almost suggests I could ask  you another problem	Which is if you asked another Which is Which is if you  asked a question with a sixth then you	3.0
Which is if you asked another Which is Which is if you  asked a question with a sixth then you	Then you do it	1.0
Then you do it	Then you could do it	1.0
Dont do that now	Then then you do a sixth	3.0
Dont do that now but I could ask you that question  couldnt I which is bigger a sixth or three quarter	Yeah	0.0
Thats what you told me	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	3.0
And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	Twentyfourths	1.0
Twentyfourths	Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and  um	1.0
Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and  um	Just like the one up there	1.0
Just like the one up there	Yeah	1.0
So youre saying that if I had an orange a blue and a black  that the model should look like the one up here	Just about	3.0
But it doesnt	well	0.0
See what happens	But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	0.0
But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	3.0
Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites  couldnt be twentyfourths	1.0
Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites  couldnt be twentyfourths	Right it would either take one	1.0
Andrew and Jessica what do  you think	Well I made a  model that had the white was one fortyeighth and the  purples were twelfths and the white was I mean the red was  twentyfourths and I took two browns as the thirds and two  dark greens as the fourths and they I called them the fourths  and then the whole was four oranges and two purples	4.0
Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns  to be	One like one one third	3.0
One like one one third	Yeah	1.0
One brown was one third two browns was two thirds	No	0.0
Is that what youre telling me	No	0.0
No	Two browns was one third	3.0
Two browns was one third	Two browns was one third	1.0
Two browns was one third	I took two browns and put them together	3.0
Two browns to be one third	Yeah	0.0
Ok lets see what theyre doing  here because um it looks to me as if you need a bunch of  rods to do this	It might not be enough	3.0
I think can you see Alan and Erik	Not really	0.0
Ok if youve seen what theyre building and  you think you understand how they built their model then if  you can sit down and then Id like another group to come up  and see	And what we did is this  was our whole and this was like these like um two  two browns equal  one third like we counted two as one	4.0
And what we did is this  was our whole and this was like these like um two  two browns equal  one third like we counted two as one	And those were our  thirds and two greens was one and one two three four so  those were our fourths and	4.0
And those were our  thirds and two greens was one and one two three four so  those were our fourths and	Purples were the	1.0
Purples were the	Purples were the twelfths and the reds were the	1.0
Purples were the twelfths and the reds were the	Twentyfourths	1.0
Twentyfourths	And the white ones were fortyeighths	1.0
Um some of you can come around while we can hear  Andrew and Jessica  would you mind doing this a couple  of times	Yeah	0.0
Some of you can come behind the table I  think	So what we did was we um	0.0
Ok just a second lets wait till as many people uh can	We had the um whole was four oranges and two purples  and then we our strategy was we took two browns and we  put em together and they were the third	4.0
We had the um whole was four oranges and two purples  and then we our strategy was we took two browns and we  put em together and they were the third	And then we took  two dark greens and put them together and they were the  fourths	4.0
And then we took  two dark greens and put them together and they were the  fourths	And then the purple was the twelfth	4.0
And then the purple was the twelfth	Twentytwelfth	1.0
Twentytwelfth	And the red was the twentyfourth and the white was the  fortyeighth	3.0
And the red was the twentyfourth and the white was the  fortyeighth	Fortyeighths	1.0
Fortyeighths	And	0.0
And	Cuz what we did really to figure it out	0.0
Well whats the difference	The difference is one twelfth	3.0
Can you show us	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Ok we dont have enough well just take them over here	0.0
Ok we dont have enough well just take them over here	Two thirds thats all we need and then	3.0
Two thirds thats all we need and then	So um do we need anything	0.0
So um do we need anything	Here we need brown	3.0
Here we need brown	We need some of those	3.0
We need some of those	Ok well we came up with the conclusion of that	0.0
Ok well we came up with the conclusion of that	That two thirds	3.0
That two thirds	That two thirds  that four three fourths  were  bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	3.0
That two thirds  that four three fourths  were  bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	By one twelfth	1.0
By one twelfth	Or two twentyfourths	1.0
Or two twentyfourths	Or	0.0
Or	Or four fortyeighths	3.0
Hold on a  minute Jessica I think were having a little discussion  about uh solutions there Ok can you nice and loud for the  people back there show them what youre doing	Well what we did was we made a model and we counted  um	3.0
Well what we did was we made a model and we counted  um	Four oranges	1.0
Four oranges	four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our  thirds we counted we counted two oranges as one I mean  two browns as one	4.0
four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our  thirds we counted we counted two oranges as one I mean  two browns as one	And we had	0.0
And we had	that was our third	3.0
that was our third	That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two  greens as one  two  dark greens as one	4.0
That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two  greens as one  two  dark greens as one	Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were forty eights	4.0
Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were forty eights	Fortyeighths	1.0
Fortyeighths	And we think that we think that three um  fourths are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I  mean four fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	4.0
And we think that we think that three um  fourths are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I  mean four fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	No two twentyfourths	1.0
No two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourth or whats that	2.0
Two twentyfourth or whats that	One twelfth	3.0
What do you think about that Michael	I guess I agree with it its what I came up with	1.0
You came up with the same model didnt you	Yeah	1.0
Meredith and David and Erik and Alan  does this model  have anything to do with the theory you tested David	Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one  fortyeighth	3.0
Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one  fortyeighth	And and the	0.0
And and the	And then the reds would be um one	3.0
And then the reds would be um one	Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought  that the light greens would be well David thought that the  light greens would be twelfths but then we tried it and they  would become the sixteenths so then we tried the purple  yeah the sixteenths and we tried the purple and then that  was the twelfths	4.0
Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought  that the light greens would be well David thought that the  light greens would be twelfths but then we tried it and they  would become the sixteenths so then we tried the purple  yeah the sixteenths and we tried the purple and then that  was the twelfths	Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	1.0
Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	So in other words we doubled everything	1.0
So in other words we doubled everything	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	You basically just added like there originally were  just two oranges now there are four oranges and an extra  purple	4.0
You basically just added like there originally were  just two oranges now there are four oranges and an extra  purple	Now there are six there are six browns	4.0
All of these represent one is that a surprise	It could have been two purples changing into a brown	3.0
It could have been two purples changing into a brown	Yeah	0.0
Thats true	And	0.0
You see this one  here you called the orange and red one isnt that right and  here you called one two orange and purple right	So basically its just doubled	3.0
So basically its just doubled	Thats	0.0
In what way is it doubled	Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and  two purples or a brown so	4.0
But the first one doesnt have any purples	Well thats because this had nothing to do with the first  problem because of the first question but	4.0
Im not sure I understand what youre saying	Had there have been sixths	3.0
Had there have been sixths	I know	0.0
We didnt have sixths we had twelfths here	Mmm hmm	0.0
Mmm hmm	I think I know what hes saying	0.0
I think I know what hes saying	Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are  fortyeighths this time	4.0
Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are  fortyeighths this time	Now up there there are no purples  because they werent  put on	4.0
Now up there there are no purples  because they werent  put on	But had they have been on the  bottom which they are they are twelfths because	4.0
But had they have been on the  bottom which they are they are twelfths because	Purples	0.0
Purples	In that	0.0
In that	Purples are twelfths	3.0
Purples are twelfths	In that model they became twelfths but over there they  would be the sixths	1.0
In that model they became twelfths but over there they  would be the sixths	Like Amy said if	0.0
Like Amy said if	Right because if you double each of them it would come  out to twice the number	4.0
Right because if you double each of them it would come  out to twice the number	Exactly	1.0
James	Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and  two purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the  reds there its two reds make a purple and that that means  the two oranges and the red make two oranges and a purple	4.0
Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and  two purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the  reds there its two reds make a purple and that that means  the two oranges and the red make two oranges and a purple	Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model  and a purple and then two more oranges and a purple and  you put them on top of each other theyd be equal	4.0
Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model  and a purple and then two more oranges and a purple and  you put them on top of each other theyd be equal	But if  you put em side to side youd have four oranges and two  purples or the two purples could be a brown	4.0
But if  you put em side to side youd have four oranges and two  purples or the two purples could be a brown	So its  basically doubled each of the length is doubled	4.0
But how did the red get doubled	The red	0.0
Im confused how did the red get doubled here	The red	0.0
Kimberly	Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a  purple so now if they have a purple they doubled the red	4.0
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I was going to say something different	1.0
Danielle	Um four oranges and two purples	3.0
Or four oranges and one brown	Yep	0.0
If I were to make another  model Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question  what do you think my question is Andrew	If you were gonna make another model what um the  doubles be	3.0
Brian	Um fortyeight	3.0
Imagine in your head what I would  call one	Fortyeight	3.0
Fortyeight	Cuz there would be well cuz there would be  fortyeight whites equal up to one and then	4.0
Well we have fortyeight whites going up to one here  dont we	Oh	0.0
In this model	So we have to double that	3.0
So we have to double that	But no	0.0
I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew  what do you think	Well youre saying what	0.0
Well youre saying what	No it cant	3.0
No it cant	Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	3.0
Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	It cant be done	3.0
Eight orange rods Im listening	Eight orange rods and two browns	3.0
Eight orange rods and two browns	And two browns	1.0
And two brown rods	You cant double that	3.0
You cant double that	You cant double that model because  if you did then you wouldnt be able to third it	4.0
You cant double that model because  if you did then you wouldnt be able to third it	You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you  just train it	1.0
You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you  just train it	Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges  and two browns now is there any rod that could third that	4.0
Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges  and two browns now is there any rod that could third that	Well if you use a train	3.0
Well if you use a train	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	1.0
If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	3.0
Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	It would probably be	0.0
It would probably be	Up there its just plain except for the whole	3.0
Up there its just plain except for the whole	It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and  three dark greens would be the fourths	4.0
It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and  three dark greens would be the fourths	Right but that would be using more than one rod to make  another rod to fit fit the same thing	1.0
Right but that would be using more than one rod to make  another rod to fit fit the same thing	Yeah so you can do that	1.0
Yeah so you can do that	Just like you Andrew said you  can use a train to make a third and a fourth	1.0
Just like you Andrew said you  can use a train to make a third and a fourth	Cuz he like I I  overheard they said that if you can use a train to make a  whole why cant you use it to make a third and a fourth	4.0
Cuz he like I I  overheard they said that if you can use a train to make a  whole why cant you use it to make a third and a fourth	Yeah	1.0
David	And a half	3.0
And a half	But then it wouldnt be equal	1.0
But then it wouldnt be equal	Yeah they would	1.0
Yeah they would	Cuz the third could be like in that  model Andrew used the two browns thats equal	1.0
Cuz the third could be like in that  model Andrew used the two browns thats equal	But in that model the three browns dont have anything  attached on so its totally equal	1.0
But in that model the three browns dont have anything  attached on so its totally equal	So	2.0
So	They just doubled it	3.0
They just doubled it	But if you added something on	1.0
But if you added something on	We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that  model	1.0
We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that  model	Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	1.0
Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	So in the next model	0.0
Did you want to say something	Um I agree with Erik	1.0
What part of what Erik said	Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like  Erik said that you can train it and put the other blocks onto  the other one	4.0
Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like  Erik said that you can train it and put the other blocks onto  the other one	What I meant what I meant is you cant third it just using  one rod	3.0
Ok Alan	Exactly	0.0
Exactly	You cant third it using one rod but you can third  it using trains	3.0
Ok so	You could double that but you would have to use two rods  to make it	3.0
Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can  imagine  can you make one bigger than that	If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges   and sixteen oranges and four browns	4.0
Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id  like you to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful  models you built but the question Id like you to think about  is uh is there is there a biggest model	Thirtytwo oranges	3.0
Ok I think we have to stop Ill see you in two weeks and if  you could	I wonder how many oranges	2.0
Are you all as awake as I am	Yeah	0.0
Does anyone remember Andrew	Um is onehalf bigger uh is one half bigger than one fourth  by how much	0.0
Is your hand up  Audra	No	0.0
Do you  remember Meredith	Um what s bigger one half or one quarter and by how  much	3.0
Did you all build the same  model	No	0.0
To answer that question	No no	0.0
Erik	Some of us built the same models and some of us built  different	1.0
Do you remember	Oh	0.0
Erik	Could you get different answers	3.0
Could you get different answers	Using barred models	1.0
Using barred models	if you use different models	1.0
Michael have you been thinking about that a little bit	Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that  we got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth  because it will always take two it will always take four  quarters to equal up	4.0
Um well I figured that it couldnt be because our answer that  we got me and Brian was that it was bigger by one fourth  because it will always take two it will always take four  quarters to equal up	Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it  by two	4.0
Yeah because four is an even number and you can divide it  by two	In half	1.0
In half	So there will always be one fourth and two fourths three  fourths four fourths and two fourths is always going to be a  half a half in fourths	4.0
What are you why are you smiling about  Mark	Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	4.0
Uh well I wasnt thinking about the sizes	I made the sea  monster bigger than the boat	4.0
Did you want the sea monster to be bigger than the boat	No	0.0
What about the boat and the children	Those too	3.0
Those too	The children are bigger	3.0
No	Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of  just the boat	1.0
Maybe he was trying to focus on the children and instead of  just the boat	Yeah he was probably trying maybe to make them look  bigger like youre looking at the children not the boat	1.0
I I	like he doesnt he just put the boat in	1.0
Yeah	Cause theyre at the dock	4.0
Cause theyre at the dock	Yeah but he wasnt just focusing  on the boat	4.0
Mark	Uh the boats the biggest	3.0
Do you agree	Mm hmm	1.0
okay	And then the children um and then the fish	3.0
You all agree with that	Um hmm	1.0
Would you  all make the same model	No	1.0
What wouldnt change about all of your models Beth	Wed have the same idea	3.0
And whats that idea that would be the same	That two people fish and and the boat	3.0
Because we have that here	Their sizes are the boats biggest and then the children	3.0
Meredith	Well maybe not because everybody cant have the same  because they dont have theyre not like copying each other	4.0
some of you might use little  dolls or something right or bigger dolls or	You re not measuring the same	3.0
And if somebody came in  now with a fish bigger than the boy  that would  have missed the point right	No because a fish could be bigger than a boy	4.0
Would it look different	Yes	0.0
Would the relationships that youre suppose to show  change	No	0.0
Well it depends on how big the fish is	It would look like a shrimp	3.0
Graham	Well it wouldnt fit	3.0
And what  would happen Meredith	Well you could put the Audras fish and you could put  Danielles fish into Audras box because it s small and it  could fit in	4.0
It could be a shrimp	but you cant put Audras fish into Danielles box because its too small	4.0
So in this  case if if your one is going to be the size of this little stage if  you like  your players are made the boy  the girl the fish the boat in relationship to this stage isnt it	Mm hmm	0.0
Isnt that right	Yup	0.0
Would you expect it to work if  your	Maybe maybe	0.0
So tell me what you re thinking	Well your old model say your old model you decided it was  too little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	4.0
Well your old model say your old model you decided it was  too little and you couldnt see all the figures in it	So you  make a bigger model and you try to take the fish from that  little model because you decide that you dont want to make  another one you put it in and you wouldnt be able to see it  there	4.0
Right	Yeah mmm hmm	0.0
Would you expect lets say in Audras model which is a  different model that her fish was smaller than the people and  smaller than the boat	Youd have bigger people bigger boat and a bigger fish	3.0
But should those relationships hold	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
Yeah is that right	Yeah	0.0
Or if we had sort of a medium size model like Marks and he  were trying to make these fit would you expect the fish to be  smaller than the people than the boat	Yeah	0.0
So in each of your models would have those relationships  holding right	Yeah	0.0
But they wouldnt all be built the same way and they wouldnt  all be the same size	So it d be its standard that the fish would be smaller than the  boat and the people except the fish would be different sized  and the people different sized and the boat different sized	4.0
Is that like what youre doing when you make models  to compare fractions	Yeah	0.0
Meredith	Well if you have the same question asked and you do it right  then youre going to wind up with the same answer and some  of the models could be bigger and some of them could be  smaller	4.0
What do you think the question is	Um is the mod is different models bigger than others and  um	3.0
Do you want to say that one more time	You can use different models that are theyre the same	3.0
Lets see what Audra thinks  the question is and then we can hear from those of you who  can try to help	Its that we um its about ah there are different  sizes of just like the candy bar that we did before	4.0
Its that we um its about ah there are different  sizes of just like the candy bar that we did before	Um you  were asking um if we thought what sizes can fit into each  box what sizes should be that we are going to get confused  that the fish can fit into a box	4.0
What do you think the question is	Im not sure	0.0
Go ahead Erik give it a try  because we also have some people coming in	It has to do with the model that Mark made	1.0
It has to do with the model that Mark made	Can the fish the  fish should be smaller than the people in the boat but the  people should be bigger than the boat or no they should be  bigger than the fish but they shouldnt be bigger than the  boat either	3.0
Can the fish the  fish should be smaller than the people in the boat but the  people should be bigger than the boat or no they should be  bigger than the fish but they shouldnt be bigger than the  boat either	And how does that how do those models help us understand the models were building	2.0
Michael do you want to add to that	Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller  than the people and the people have to be smaller than the  boat cause the people have to go in the boat and the people  have to be able to pull the fish out of the water and if it was  bigger than it they might have a little trouble getting it out	4.0
Well its sort of like um you cant the fish has to be smaller  than the people and the people have to be smaller than the  boat cause the people have to go in the boat and the people  have to be able to pull the fish out of the water and if it was  bigger than it they might have a little trouble getting it out	So um so then um its sort of like so that just  helps us understand what we re talking about with the  Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to  make different sized um halves and quarters um but  they re basically you can call it the same thing as you would  then just the small one with the small one if you call the box  a whole and the boat a half it would equal a quarter	4.0
So um so then um its sort of like so that just  helps us understand what we re talking about with the  Cuisenaire rods when we are using different sized boxes to  make different sized um halves and quarters um but  they re basically you can call it the same thing as you would  then just the small one with the small one if you call the box  a whole and the boat a half it would equal a quarter	You  could still do that in Audras model or any box	4.0
Oh it was said already	Yes	0.0

He used up my example	I have it right here	0.0
Ok is it possible to make another example Alan	Yeah I guess	0.0
Would it still work	Yeah	0.0
You re sure it would work	Just like we did	0.0
Just like we did	Two after the other can be third	3.0
By the way which is bigger	Ok We figured out by taking out	0.0
Ok We figured out by taking out	Because if you have we figured that well let me just see  right here both models we have the halves and the thirds	4.0
Because if you have we figured that well let me just see  right here both models we have the halves and the thirds	Like it was like the other problem it was one half and one  third	4.0
Like it was like the other problem it was one half and one  third	And we explained it we said that one half was bigger  than one third but smaller than two thirds	4.0
And we explained it we said that one half was bigger  than one third but smaller than two thirds	Like up here  there s one half right there and there s the thirds there s the  second third	4.0
By how much	One sixth	3.0
But one half and two thirds	One oh that s exactly that s exactly what we meant	0.0
One oh that s exactly that s exactly what we meant	These  are two thirds and that s one half	3.0
These  are two thirds and that s one half	With one of the thirds it would be a sixth	4.0
With one of the thirds it would be a sixth	But if you added  one it would still be one sixth	4.0

I m going to trace them just to get the exact size	You re  writing	0.0
You re  writing	Well we ve got we ve got that whole this is the whole we  have the three thirds and we then the half	3.0
And what we supposed to figure out after we did that	Which is bigger a half or two thirds	0.0
Is it still the same or does it change  when your model changes	Two thirds is still bigger	3.0
How many do you think	Eighteen	3.0
So how much larger	It s bigger	3.0
It s bigger	One eighteenth	3.0
My goodness tell me help me remember what it was over  there	It was bigger by one one sixth	3.0
This  is different from the other one or the same	It s different in a way and it s the same in a way	3.0
How s it different and how s it the same	Well it s the same because the half is smaller and it s  different because um this one it only ta the little box are  only um two three four there s only six of them and here s  there s eighteen and this the thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths	4.0
You mean yeah the two thirds are bigger by three  eighteenths	and the two thirds over here is bigger by one sixth	3.0
I  agree with you you re saying that two thirds is still bigger  but it it bigger by a different thing	Well	0.0
Ok Danielle what do you think about this time	Well um two thirds	3.0
Can you build a two thirds and a one half  for him separate so we can then compare	Here s the two thirds and here s the half	3.0
What s the difference	and it s bigger by two twelfths	3.0
and it s bigger by two twelfths	It s um it s bigger by two twelfths	3.0
How are the answers I don t understand  what do you think about this	One two three	0.0
Over here it was how much	This one was bigger by three eighteenths	3.0
And this one	Was bigger by  how much	2.0
Was bigger by  how much	Two twelfths	3.0
Two twelfths	One two three four five six seven eight nine  ten eleven twelve	0.0
And your original one was	It was bigger by one sixth	3.0
Oh so what do you think	I think they re all different but then all the same	4.0
I think they re all different but then all the same	Cause  they re the same because the thirds are always bigger than  the half	4.0
The two thirds are always bigger than the half	And um and they re different because these are all the  whites	4.0
And um and they re different because these are all the  whites	they re different sizes	3.0
they re different sizes	They re all different like one two uh three they re  different	1.0
They re all different like one two uh three they re  different	So they re different like that	3.0
Or this difference here	You could use a light green	3.0
What would that be	That would be one That would  be one sixth	3.0
And what did you say it was over here with the little  one	Um that s one sixth	3.0
So if you used the light green	It could be one sixth	3.0
And if you used the whites	It would be three eighteenths	3.0
What about for this one	What problem	0.0
Uh Gregory I want you to watch and see if  you agree with what Danielle is doing here	And  then that would be one sixth too	3.0
Mmm over each of  em	That would be one sixth that would be one sixth and that  one would be one sixth	3.0
But you have had two two different names for the answer if  you did it this way it was	It was two twelfths	3.0
And and uh Gregory for this one over here where she had  the three what was the name for that one	Three eighteenths	3.0
Alright so tell me which is bigger	Two thirds	3.0
Again	Two thirds	3.0
How many of you are  convinced you know how much bigger and no one can  persuade you otherwise that two thirds is not only bigger than  a half but it is how much bigger	One sixth	3.0
How  many of you made a second model	Oh Oh	0.0
Amy	Ah the orange and red	3.0
Did you get to have two thirds  bigger than a half	No	0.0
You didn t Michael	No they cant do that	4.0
No they cant do that	Because um the  the two thirds are bigger than the half by a red	4.0
Because um the  the two thirds are bigger than the half by a red	So they cant  use those whites to show it	4.0
Oh but youre saying that youre saying that two thirds  whats a third	A third is the purple	3.0
Just tell us	Um two thirds is two purples	3.0
And what did you get to be  one half	Uh dark green	3.0
And you got two thirds to  be bigger than one half	Yes	0.0
By how much	By one sixth	3.0
By one sixth	Or or two twelfths	1.0
Or or two twelfths	No	1.0
What color rod	Red	3.0
And what did you get Meredith	Two twelfths	3.0
What do you think about that	Well in a way	0.0
Well in a way	No	0.0
No	Uh uh	0.0
Well she showed its bigger by the two whites she shows  two whites bigger	Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together  one sixth	3.0
Yeah but then she would have to call the two whites together  one sixth	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	1.0
Shes calling the whites one white one sixth	Yeah she said	0.0
Shes calling one white one sixth	No Im not Im calling it one twelfth	1.0
Shes calling one white one twelfth	Yeah but see just the whites together	4.0
Yeah but see just the whites together	Thatd be right it  would be two twelfths	4.0
Thatd be right it  would be two twelfths	But you have to combine them	4.0
Ok but she didnt combine them and shes calling the two  whites together again Meredith	One twelfth two twelfths	3.0
And two white rods would be	Two twelfths	3.0
And one red would be	One sixth	3.0
So so what is Meredith saying here	Theres two answers	3.0
Are there two answers	No theyre the same answer	1.0
No theyre the same answer	No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red  and divided it into half she divided it into halves into half  and called and called each half one twelfth	4.0
No theyre the exact same thing except she she took the red  and divided it into half she divided it into halves into half  and called and called each half one twelfth	Theyre the exact  same answer except theyre just in two parts	4.0
Well give it the number  name what did you say	One sixth	3.0
And two whites can I write two  w    for two whites	Yeah	0.0
And youre calling two whites	Two twelfths	3.0
But what Erik just told me  right is something about red and white	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	A red one red equals one red rod up here one red  equals two of the white ones	3.0
Do you all agree to that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
Yes	And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other  white rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	4.0
And since shes calling a white rod one twelfth and the other  white rod one twelfth and the red rod is really one sixth	But  when she calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are  actually just two white rods put together to equal a red so it  should be really its really one sixth	4.0
But  when she calls them two twelfths the two twelfths are  actually just two white rods put together to equal a red so it  should be really its really one sixth	Because two whites  two whites	4.0
She says one white is a twelfth and then if you put it  together with another one twelfth  shes saying you  get two twelfths	And its one sixth its one sixth	3.0
Is that what you are saying	Yeah	0.0
All those things are they true	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But I dont really think you could call call them two  twelfths because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size  as one sixth	4.0
But I dont really think you could call call them two  twelfths because two twelfths equal exactly to the same size  as one sixth	Well if you want to you could call them I  guess	4.0
Well if you want to you could call them I  guess	But I think it would be easier just to call them one  sixth then wouldnt want to exactly call them one twelfth and  another twelfth	4.0
But I think it would be easier just to call them one  sixth then wouldnt want to exactly call them one twelfth and  another twelfth	Id just call them one sixth	4.0
Id just call them one sixth	Therefore I think  you just really call them one sixth	4.0
Therefore I think  you just really call them one sixth	Well maybe you can call them	0.0
Well maybe you can call them	Well you can call them if you want to but	3.0
Well we have different number names for these rods	they re not different	3.0
they re not different	Theres just half of one theres just half of one	3.0
So youre saying that one half of the one sixth is another way  of saying one twelfth	Theyre just two answers	3.0
Isnt that what you said	What Erik said is that two whites equal one red so it would  be the exact same thing	4.0
So are all of these  true statements	Yeah	0.0
So Meredith is still saying that I dont disagree with  you when I say that its a red bigger in this model  right	Um hmm	0.0
Is that a good  question Meredith	Mm hmm	0.0
Two white rods	Two of the white rods	0.0
Two of the white rods	Thats a red rod	3.0
What are you  going to call the two white rods	One fifth	3.0
I hear a  couple of answers here and Im confused so I  want to hear this	Alright the reason why we called it one fifth  is we put the red one up to two whites and  you said  what would you call the two  whites  and the two whites equal up to the  red so so if you put the reds and line them up  to the orange it makes one fifth	4.0
Audra go ahead	Well if you put two whites against the red  rod and you put two whites up against the  red rod five times across it youd get the  same amount of whites as would reds so and  you got five reds before so you get five pairs  of whites	4.0
Yeah because I think you have the idea I  think Im just not understanding it	If you put all the whites you could up against  it and you and you double  them up  If you put two whites together to  make one block it would be a red block	4.0
If you put all the whites you could up against  it and you and you double  them up  If you put two whites together to  make one block it would be a red block	And  if you did that as many times as you could  youd get five times	4.0
Meredith you have your hand up	I think its two tenths	3.0
Beth do you want to come up	Well take the red away and you put this up to the orange	4.0
Well take the red away and you put this up to the orange	When we did it  before we said that we said that orange has  ten whites it measures up to ten whites	4.0
When we did it  before we said that we said that orange has  ten whites it measures up to ten whites	And  if you put the whites up it would have ten	4.0
And  if you put the whites up it would have ten	And two of ten is two tenths	4.0
And two of ten is two tenths	Ok Well now what do you think	2.0
Ok Well now what do you think	Do you  want to add to that	0.0
Do you  want to add to that	Is that basically what you  were arguing or do you want to add to that  some more	2.0
David how  about you	Um well I think the same as Meredith	1.0
Brian	Well even that even that two white cubes  equal up to one red cube its still not its still  not like um like um imagining that this was  another red cube so I think it really is two  tenths because it really really is two tenths	4.0
Because you can see two there is that what  youre saying	Yeah yeah it it also is one it also is one fifth  but what you are seeing right here really is  two tenths not a fifth	3.0
Brian is saying he can  see how it could be one fifth if we changed it  to a red if we took the two whites and  changed it to red but when he looks at the  two whites he thinks of two tenths right	Because theres two theres only two theres  only two theres not like theyre not joined  together	4.0
Because theres two theres only two theres  only two theres not like theyre not joined  together	If you want to join them together  you should use the red	4.0
Some of us will  be around to kind of hear what youre thinking  about it	Beth  This is a ten and ten of these equal to one	3.0
Okay what do  we think over here you two	This is only one because if you call the orange a  ten and the ones equal to a ten when you call  this  a one then theyre going to  change to a one	4.0
Are you in agreement with that  or do you think its something different	Well I think I agree with Meredith	1.0
Well I think I agree with Meredith	Because if  this is ten then this would be one then because  if you add ten of these up  then umm there  would be ten of these	4.0
Because if  this is ten then this would be one then because  if you add ten of these up  then umm there  would be ten of these	So its ten	4.0
Brian what do you think	Well umm ten wholes because well these are  originally tenths and this is considered if this  is considered ten then this would be this  would be like switched around ten wholes	4.0
Okay	So its like switched around	3.0
Okay so if we are going to call this    ten  and the number name for this  would be	Ten wholes	3.0
Would it be called ten	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Well if this was one then that would be  ten but when its switched around this is  all  all ten all ten tenths when you put them on  here theyre like they would be like ten wholes  even though this would be considered   Well   if this is supposed to be ten you put  then of these up then these would be ten  wholes	3.0
You said if I put then of  them up its ten wholes	One	3.0
One	One whole	3.0
One whole	One whole  no   I dont  know how to say it but I think I know it	3.0
One whole  no   I dont  know how to say it but I think I know it	I dont  know how to say it	0.0
You said something like one if this would be	Yeah yeah one	3.0
Just call it  ten	Ok but but didnt you call this  a   ten	3.0
I asked you what you would call this	Oh then this would be  one  I guess	3.0
Okay now let me just hear what these ladies  over here have come up with	Umm we got since umm if you have like if  you put all these  up to this   umm you would get umm ten I think	4.0
Umm we got since umm if you have like if  you put all these  up to this   umm you would get umm ten I think	Wait   Ten	4.0
Wait   Ten	And and this one  just  that would be one	4.0
So thats the number you would give it then	Yeah because if you have ten then  that  would be one of them	4.0
Let  me just  What did you come up with	If ten of these  equals one of these   then one of these  could be  one whole because and then ten of these  would ten wholes	4.0
We  wont say wholes for now	Okay	0.0
So  what would this be	That would be  two	3.0
That would be  two	And then three and four    and five and six	0.0
Is there anybody who would like to  tell me what they think about this	Call on my girlfriend here	0.0
Jackie	Umm	0.0
Umm	The white would be one	3.0
I heard a lot of  people say they would call the white  one    Why would you call the white  one	Well because it takes ten ones to make up an orange	4.0
Can you say it again please	It takes ten ones to make up an orange	3.0
Okay and if Im calling  the orange  ten  youre calling the white the  number name	One	3.0
Michael	Well I think I would call the yellow  twenty  five  because twenty five plus twenty five  equals fifty	4.0
Umm why didnt you say ten plus ten plus  ten plus ten plus ten equals fifty	Because it takes two yellow rods to equal one  orange rod	4.0
Beth	Umm me and Sarah thought first we  thought itd be umm twenty and thirty but  we knew we couldnt do that because they were exactly the same size the  yellows	4.0
Umm me and Sarah thought first we  thought itd be umm twenty and thirty but  we knew we couldnt do that because they were exactly the same size the  yellows	So then we started thinking in cents  and we thought of two quarters equal umm  fifty and so one twenty five and twenty five  equals fifty	4.0
What number would I give to one  white rod if were still calling the orange the  number name  fifty	Five ten fifteen twenty     Oh	3.0
Okay I want to hear now take a little time  think about it and talk to your partners	We would call these little ones five  ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty  five forty and then fifty	4.0
We would call these little ones five  ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty  five forty and then fifty	And you get fifty out of ten	4.0
How did you come up  with it so quickly	I did	0.0
Why didnt you start counting by  twos or tens	Because	0.0
Because	Tens because tens would only  need five	4.0
Tens because tens would only  need five	So it would be ten twenty thirty  forty fifty	4.0
So it would be ten twenty thirty  forty fifty	So for tens it would be five	4.0
So for tens it would be five	And  then for twos  two four six eight ten and it  would go on and be more than ten	4.0
And five just popped into your head as being  the right one	Yeah	0.0
Let me hear  what some other people are saying	I think it is five because cause five times ten  equals fifty	4.0
What do you think	I think that its five too	1.0
You think five works	Yes	0.0
Thats what Im  wondering	We know our we know our division	3.0
We know our we know our division	Ha ha  we know out multiplication  tables	3.0
Do you  really feel you could convince people that we  would be calling the white rod the number  name  five	Uh huh	0.0
Here let me come  over and see then next	Five	3.0
Five	You count by fives	3.0
You count by fives	Five ten fifteen  twenty twenty five thirty thirty five forty  forty five fifty	3.0
Im asking people that  around here	Well we tried like we just though umm  like  well we tried umm twos and that  didnt work	3.0
Well we tried like we just though umm  like  well we tried umm twos and that  didnt work	So then we just thought five	3.0
And it worked	Yeah	0.0
Brian lets hear what you have  here	I got the answer but I dont know how to say  it  explain it really	0.0
Its a good chance  to practice talking to me	Well I just found out five I dont know I  cant find out why	4.0
Well I just found out five I dont know I  cant find out why	I think well five times  ten equals fifty so	4.0
Thats interesting	Well well because there are ten of them here and  hm Im not sure Im not  sure	4.0
Well well because there are ten of them here and  hm Im not sure Im not  sure	Before I said one fiftieth but I think  Dave explained something to me and I  thought I guess I just thought it was right	4.0
Before I said one fiftieth but I think  Dave explained something to me and I  thought I guess I just thought it was right	But I guess Ill just go with one fiftieth	4.0
Youre going to go with that	Yeah one fiftieth	3.0
One fiftieth	Yeah but Im not that sure	0.0
It just seems like a good name to call it  because youre calling this fifty	Yeah	0.0
Is that what youre thinking	Yeah and if there are fifty of them in there I  guess I just call it one fiftieth	4.0
Fifty of what kind  of what	Um Fifty	3.0
Fifty of these here	Well no but but if were calling this fifty and there are each one in there  then its pretty much called a  fiftieth I guess	4.0
Hmm ok so thats the number name youve  given it	Yeah	0.0
Please everybody listen to this and see if this  is an argument thats like yours because if  yours is different you know Id like to hear  it	If we call the white cube five then it would  equal up to fifty	4.0
Ok lets hear their argument  maybe this will convince us one way or  another that this works	If you count by fives to fifty youll have ten  youll count youll have ten you have to have  five ten times to get to fifty	4.0
If you count by fives to fifty youll have ten  youll count youll have ten you have to have  five ten times to get to fifty	And then um	0.0
That it  brought them up to fifty when they counted  each of those as a five those white ones	Well I did it sort of equivalent	4.0
Well I did it sort of equivalent	I did five  times ten equals fifty	4.0
Ok why did you why  did you decide to do that to use a  multiplication problem to help you	Because this is a ten rod	4.0
Because this is a ten rod	It  has ten ones	4.0
It  has ten ones	Ten times five equals fifty	4.0
Ten times five equals fifty	So I  said ten times what gives you fifty	4.0
So I  said ten times what gives you fifty	And five  gives you ten times five equals fifty	4.0
It looks like youre using the light greens and reds David	What I did was light greens were one half and the reds are one  third and the dark green was one whole	3.0
So  when you go to compare them how do you do that	Well I made a balance to see which was bigger	3.0
Ok do you want me to let you get your balance together and  then Ill come back	Ill get it together soon	0.0
Ok	dark green	0.0
dark green	Youd use two light  cubes  to make one half of it and then you take three reds and youd  have one third of it	4.0
Ok so	And then we found a different way if you balance it and you put  two greens on one side and three reds on the other side and they  balance	4.0
And then we found a different way if you balance it and you put  two greens on one side and three reds on the other side and they  balance	Its hard to make it balance	0.0
So youre making it balance sort of like Davids doing but its a  little different	Oh I know how to do this	0.0
Oh I know how to do this	I know	0.0
I know	One half would be this big  and one third would be this big	3.0
How much bigger is   by how  much	Id say one unit	3.0
Is there a way you could prove it	It is one half of one third	3.0
Well what number  name can we give this if we had to give it actual fraction names  well how did you find that this is a third and this is a half	First we say how many equal one third of the green and that was  two so we knew that was a half	4.0
First we say how many equal one third of the green and that was  two so we knew that was a half	And then and then it might not  work unless there is something of three that first on the dark  green and that would be the red cause you can fit three	4.0
Would that work	Yeah	0.0
Go ahead Sarah	One sixth one sixth	3.0
Ok you say that very uncertainly but why do you think that	1 2 3 4 5 6	0.0
1 2 3 4 5 6	It is six and it makes up to the green block	3.0
Ok so what is  the difference between a half and a third	A half is much larger than a third	3.0
By how much	By uh by this	3.0
Which is what number name	One sixth	3.0
Put your names on it and the date	Lets draw pictures	0.0
And the date	First we can draw this balance then this  first draw this  because this is the thing that she wants us to do	0.0
First we can draw this balance then this  first draw this  because this is the thing that she wants us to do	Im not going to be exact	0.0
Im not going to be exact	It is not a perfect fit	0.0
Ok that is a good point is there another solution to this	Ill do a seesaw	0.0
Ok while you are working on that Meredith David will show  me this	This is what I did on Friday and the dark green will be the  whole thing and the light green with be the half	3.0
The whole thing what number name is that	Umm thatd be one	3.0
Ok	And the red would be one third	4.0
And the red would be one third	What I did before when I was  ready I took off two of the red and one of the the light green	4.0
Well why did you take off two of these off	Well because then there is only one piece	4.0
Well because then there is only one piece	I thought it would  fall to the right	4.0
I thought it would  fall to the right	And on Friday thats what happened	4.0
Did you want to try it	I am not sure if it will because of these two pieces	4.0
I remember when you  did this on Friday	Because I have more support and you probably need it a little  wobbly to fall	4.0
So then can I ask you which is bigger a half or a third	A half	3.0
How much bigger is it	Well its bigger by	3.0
Maybe you can help me	If you but another rod theres going to be cutting it there and  another rod there and cutting this one in half and taking this off  breaking this in half and put one on this it would be the same	4.0
If you but another rod theres going to be cutting it there and  another rod there and cutting this one in half and taking this off  breaking this in half and put one on this it would be the same	But since we but it here and here its not the same	4.0
What would be a good number name for that	Um maybe	0.0
Or could we go back and figure out what the number name  would be for that	If this was the whole think like one then this could be three fourths	4.0
Remember this is how much of  the bar	This is a half	3.0
The question is can we come up with a  number name for the difference between a half and a third	Lets see maybe  we could do something like uh	0.0
It really is something to think about it because it must have a  number name	Like 15 or something	3.0
Why dont the three of you  come over here pull your chair over here Brian	Well we got two answers	0.0
Ok I want to hear about this	Well she didnt have enough	0.0
Who would like to share	Well first we got this one	4.0
Well first we got this one	This would be one half and this  would be one third and that would be one third	4.0
Hold up one half and one third	One half and one third	3.0
And how do you know that	Cause you take  cause this these two that isone half if that  green  ad so is that	4.0
Cause you take  cause this these two that isone half if that  green  ad so is that	So and then that would be one of the  halfs and this is all one thirds of it	4.0
So and then that would be one of the  halfs and this is all one thirds of it	And this would be one of  the thirds	4.0
Ok and Brian you worked on both of these two can you  explain this model to me	Well this is  I have to put this together  this was the whole  candy bar	3.0
Ok	And this would be the half and this would be the third	4.0
And this would be the half and this would be the third	And uh  the third is smaller and the half is bigger	4.0
And uh  the third is smaller and the half is bigger	The third is smaller  because if you have to make three of them  you ah veto make  to make it a third you have to have three of them in one you  have to have three of them in one whole but there is less room  for three of them so you and you have more room for a half so  half would be bigger	4.0
Oh ok	Yeah thats what we got two this would be the whole and that  would be the half and that would be the third	1.0
Do you think you  could remember them because we are probably going to have to  turn in an assignment	Could we just draw something	0.0
We are just about out of time but if you  want to maybe start it if you want to jot down an idea	Could we trace them and color it	0.0
Yeah if you want to trace them thats fine	I have another model I have another model to show which one  is bigger	4.0
I have another model I have another model to show which one  is bigger	If you put one red one there and a green one there and  then you put an orange rod	4.0
If you put one red one there and a green one there and  then you put an orange rod	It goes up because this is larger	4.0
What would be the number difference  between those two between the half and the third	If you take off the one it would be a difference of two ones	4.0
If you take off the one it would be a difference of two ones	But when you take but if you take this one off  two of these  and one of these off	4.0
There is definitely a difference there you can see it	And then its a difference of two	3.0
I am confused I  thought you were calling this one	And then probably we would call this we would call that sixths	3.0
And then probably we would call this we would call that sixths	One sixth	3.0
What would we call that	A difference of two sixths	3.0
I heard one sixth and I heard two  sixts and I want to know before I go then what it is	Like I said if you would  separate  em	4.0
Like I said if you would  separate  em	And you gave one of these one of these and two more kids then youd have more	4.0
And you gave one of these one of these and two more kids then youd have more	You sure would	1.0
Right but if now I took it away again then what would be the  number name for the difference	One in each handful one in each third	3.0
What is the number name for  that I forgot what are we calling the white block	Um one sixth	3.0
Um one sixth	Because theres two one sixths	4.0
Because theres two one sixths	I was calling this one sixth because six of these add up to one  one whole	4.0
I was calling this one sixth because six of these add up to one  one whole	And if you only had one sixth if you said it was only sixth then  you wouldnt have one for that	4.0
And if you only had one sixth if you said it was only sixth then  you wouldnt have one for that	So it has to be two sixths	4.0
What if the question is through that instead of asking you to  look at the whole candy bar then I am just asking you to  compare the amounts of a half and a third of the candy bar	One half	4.0
One half	Then the difference would be one sixth for each half	4.0
Its running	please turn off the air	0.0
Okay	go out to my locker and get my maths book	0.0
Oh you wont need it today	Oh okay	0.0
Are you going to be sitting down	I havent	0.0
Oh then youve got to go outside then	books	0.0
Theyre not supposed to be coming in here	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	What	0.0
But um Theyll have to	Oh okay so what should we do	0.0
Can someone give me a word or two that you need	Convex	3.0
It certainly must be important since it occurs more than once	Quadrilateral	3.0
Okay weve got quadrilateral	Polygon	3.0
Some others words or phrases	Exterior angle	3.0
Were there any others	Rays	3.0
Can anyone help us with what a polygon might be	Its a fivesided shape	3.0
Hmm not a lot	Any twoD shape	3.0
So would that be a polygon	Any twoD shape which is enclosed	3.0
Mm oh thats enclosed	Mm a manysided shape	3.0
Manysided shape	Straight	3.0
How many sides has that got	Six	3.0
Peter	Um an exterior angle lies outside the polygon	0.0
What does the first sentence underneath the heading say	Um exterior angle  polygon  is formed when of the sides is extended	0.0
And it does lie outside the original polygon does it	Yes	0.0
How many of those could you get from this hexagon	Six	3.0
And then	Um start from one point and then go  create a ray	4.0
Um start from one point and then go  create a ray	And then somewhere along that ray draw another one across	4.0
Now think carefully about that	You go to the point	3.0
Now what havent we explained yet	Convex	3.0
Convex	Convex	1.0
Anyone know theres a word thats the opposite of convex	Oh	0.0
Oh	Doesnt convex mean its like um when you have glasses theres uh  convex lens is the one which is curved	3.0
Thats the key thing	Outside	3.0
Outside	Inside	1.0
Inside	Outside	1.0
The the other word that means the opposite of that also starts with that	Concave	3.0
Whats that sort of thing called that youve just written down	Conjecture	3.0
Uh so if youd like to do that	the chair	0.0
the chair	No	0.0
No	Give me the chair	0.0
Give me the chair	Thats so unfair Give me the chair	0.0
Notice Ive fixed up	Yes	0.0
Yes	Thank you	0.0
Well theres a pentagon already	How come	0.0
You can make it a bit bigger but uh it should click on to that last	Oh look at	0.0
No thats not joined on	Okay now	0.0
Can I just test this one for you	Oops	0.0
So now we can measure the angle	Okay	0.0
Okay now do the same for that one	Measure the angles	3.0
And then you can then you can have that angle plus that angle plus	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thank you	0.0
So youve just got to select the point tool and click somewhere out there	Okay	0.0
Okay	Now we need to put  on this	0.0
Thats good	That one	0.0
That one	No you did that one first	0.0
I think you might need the select tool	Do you just measure the exterior or the inside ones as well	3.0
Remember click somewhere to get rid of the other selection and then go that that that Do you remember how to measure the angles	Yeah	0.0
So did they change	Yeah but	0.0
What about if you make it concave	It does but	0.0
Point two	its weird if you move these two it seems to	0.0
A B C D E A B C Youve got angle D H D which is yeah cause youve actually measured angle D H E which is that angle over there	Thats cause we drew the middle one in first	4.0
Thats cause we drew the middle one in first	Oh	0.0
But itll mean you have to change your formula as well	Its easier to understand sir it came out for us	0.0
Its easier to understand sir it came out for us	Um how did you do it the other day when you just clicked one of the things and it	2.0
Now when you go to calculate you can say	Oh	0.0
That angle plus the second one plus and so on	Oh I didnt do that	0.0
Oh I didnt do that	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	I just pressed the thingy	0.0
Excellent idea	Does it matter if it goes through the rays	0.0
Youve got one with Jack	Oh we missed that one	0.0
Oh triangles too	Yep	0.0
Okay	Sir	0.0
Well which polygons have you tried so far	Um	0.0
Youve only tried a pentagon	Okay	0.0
Um what did you do there	The sides	3.0
Well can you do it again	Um	0.0
The top of it is slightly off the screen because you havent got your um your thing	How  down	0.0
Now you going to write something about it then	Yeah	0.0
Do you know how to do that	Mr  when it says um this is  try one	0.0
Now your conclusion says when you move the parts of the pentagon the sum of the angles does not change	Exterior angles	3.0
And one other one other fairly important fact that you could mention but just think about it	We havent finished it yet	0.0
We havent finished it yet	We havent finished it yet because we  change it um we have to summarize what a pentagon is	0.0
Okay but just think about when you say it does not change what doesnt it change from	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	How do I make a text box	0.0
Is that what it says	Yeah	0.0
In fact what would you really call it	Interior	3.0
Are all the other ones the same	Yeah they all look like that too	3.0
It will actually build it up for you like so	Oh thanks	0.0
Oh thanks	How do you do a degree sign	0.0
Maybe that looks like a degree sign	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	I also have another question	2.0
I also have another question	If these three have to go go into a new sketch and make other	2.0
Theyre talking about ones	Okay	0.0
So	But we dont	0.0
But we dont	Um Mr Brown	0.0
Um Mr Brown	Do we have to go on to do Do we have to go on to do	0.0
Yes the sum of the exterior angles are the same for any convex polygon which is 360 degrees	Is that right	0.0
And then say and discuss the change if you change the uh polygon	Okay	0.0
But yeah its good	Do we have to go	0.0
When youre choosing a name for it try and choose a name that actually means something	Mr Brown when we use the computer calculator we got 360 and when we did it on my calculator got to 359	3.0
Okay um were doing revision from yesterday on the congruent triangle so do you remember what a con what a pair of tria congruent triangles are	Yep	0.0
Yeah	Two triangles that are the same	3.0
Same what	Same angles same sides	3.0
Which line is equal to B C	Im sorry	0.0
Do you want me to repeat it	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Number one angle F	3.0
Yep	Number two angle C	3.0
Yes	Number three 60 degrees	3.0
Yes	Number four 90 degrees	3.0
Yes	Number five A D	3.0
Yep	Number six A B	3.0
Yes	Number seven four centimeters	3.0
Yes	Number eight five centimeters	3.0
Yes	Number nine triangle A B C is congruent to three lines	3.0
Three lines	to triangle D E F	3.0
She hasnt got it right	Oh F E D	3.0
Triangle to triangle what	F E D	3.0
F E D	D E F	1.0
D E F	You said F E D	1.0
Why did I say F E D	Because that tells  the same	3.0
Whats the same	Like F equals A	3.0
So F equals A and whats equal to C	D	3.0
So youve really got to write these in the same order	Oh	0.0
All right	And 10 is A B	3.0
And 10 is A B	Why	2.0
Just to show the congruence to show the relationship between them	Im doing them in alphabetical order	0.0
Who got nine right	Yeah I did	0.0
Number 10 was A B	Nine	3.0
So youve got five here	Yeah one two	0.0
Can you talk together	Where did you want us to move	0.0
Heres a All right	How am I going to work	0.0
So the task you need to produce a list of instructions so that anyone following them will construct exactly the same triangle	Oh	0.0
You actually have to follow the instructions	Do you make up instructions	0.0
So youve got to draw your triangle first on the second page and then write down your instructions	Is there one in the drawer	0.0
You draw it on the second sheet the top of the second sheet	Where it says your triangle	0.0
Yep	Do you need to draw two dont you	0.0
No just one	So miss the person thats giving the instructions	0.0
Everyone draws a triangle and writes down their instructions	All right	0.0
All right	So you want us to draw one triangle	0.0
Just one triangle	Do you draw the triangle like this	3.0
You ha yeah you use your protractor and your compass to draw the triangle	Can I trace this	0.0
Yeah	Okay Ill use it after	0.0
But youre not going to draw the same triangle are you	No	0.0
Yeah	Can I sharpen the pencil	0.0
Pardon	I said I dont want to get up in front of the camera	0.0
Yes you can	Im just waiting for a compass	0.0
Im just waiting for a compass	Is that what were going to be doing finding the angles and stuff	3.0
You can either find angles or you can find sides	Okay	0.0
Or a combination of both	So I could write all my angles and all my sides couldnt I	3.0
You could but thats not the minimum number	Oh so you	0.0
You might have a lot of instructions to start with and then you find after a couple that theyve actually drawn it	Okay	0.0
You should be doing yours up here	I am	0.0
Youre not supposed to know what it looks like	Um I need to make a measurement	0.0
Um I need to make a measurement	When I measured it its like that  Do I write like five point whatever	0.0
Yes youll have to yeah	Okay	0.0
Okay	Im up to you	0.0
Have you all finished	Yeah	0.0
When you all or uh three or four of you have finished the triangle you can start the first person can start reading theirs out	Okay can I read mine out now	0.0
Has Jessica finished	Yes Miss	0.0
Yes Miss	Um when we write the instructions will it be in here	0.0
Um when we write the instructions will it be in here	And um when we write it would it be draw up a five point six centimeter	0.0
It can be a combination of side size of the length of sides or angles	Miss	0.0
Depends on what you want to do	How many instructions do we have to have	0.0
Okay	Yep	0.0
Yep	Is that right just like draw	0.0
Yeah yeah	A line	3.0
Yeah well youve got to read it out to the other two now theyre not to know what you have got	I know but	0.0
Yes	Is that is that all you have to do	0.0
Yes	Oh okay	0.0
Rightyo	You ready	0.0
You ready	Is mine right	0.0
So youve got to try it	Okay	0.0
Okay	It doesnt work	0.0
It doesnt work	Shes deliberately not responding	0.0
Shes deliberately not responding	Im responding	0.0
Im responding	Shes like  because	0.0
Shes like  because	Draw a half circle	3.0
Draw a half circle	I said uh	0.0
I said uh	Okay	0.0
Okay	Yes there you go	0.0
Yes there you go	Okay now go to H	0.0
Okay now go to H	Yes	0.0
Yes	Make radius six centimeters	3.0
Make radius six centimeters	Yes	0.0
Yes	Okay have you done that	0.0
Okay have you done that	Yes	0.0
Yes	Now draw an arc from H bisecting the arc from S	3.0
Now draw an arc from H bisecting the arc from S	Okay	0.0
Okay	Using your compass measure the distance from	3.0
Using your compass measure the distance from	Okay now you ready for this	0.0
Okay now you ready for this	That was  point N so write point N Now draw Now draw a line from N to S	4.0
Yes	Okay all right trace a set square but its two minimum isnt it	3.0
No no I dont want that	Thats why I didnt think you wanted	0.0
I want lines and angles	Thats what I thought	0.0
All right	Yep	0.0
Because they might have a different size set square	Okay	0.0
Okay	Oh yeah	0.0
True	Yep	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Did it work	Well I knew how to say radius but I had to say it wasnt	3.0
All right because if it if theyve worked you need to cut them out and give them back to Jessica	Were going to do them after	0.0
All rightyo okay	So were doing one	0.0
So were doing one	This just make a radius of five centimeters	3.0
This just make a radius of five centimeters	Okay	0.0
Okay	Im not ready	0.0
Im not ready	I think mines right	0.0
Youll find out wont you	Yep	0.0
Yep	Can you can you can you bi I drew a line	3.0
Yes	And I sort of bisected	3.0
So did you decide that that was important or the length of the line was important	The length of the line oh no the angles	3.0
All right	Interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	3.0
Interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	A B	1.0
A B	Yeah interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	3.0
I think you can see theyre pretty right cant you	Interval A C is horizontal and it measures three centimeters	3.0
So did it work	Uhh no because	0.0
If they fit on top	Theyre the same but	3.0
Theyre the same but	Its the same but	1.0
She didnt have to did she	Shes got nice paper	0.0
Do you want a different color	Im kidding no	0.0
Im kidding no	So thats right	0.0
So thats right	Theyre theyre congruent	3.0
So you cut them out and give them is it yours Natalie	Thats mine thats mine	0.0
All right yeah	Is um is this congruent	3.0
Is um is this congruent	Because I wasnt here on Tuesday	0.0
Yeah whats a con congruent triangles are triangles that have the sa exactly the same sides three sides are equal and three angles are equal	I dont cut this out do I	0.0
She can cut Natalie can cut hers out	Oh can I cut this out	0.0
Oh all right	This is mine	0.0
This is mine	Thats mine	0.0
So have you done one yet	Yeah weve done two	0.0
All right	Okay	0.0
Okay	Hang on	0.0
Hang on	Ive figured it out Miss	0.0
Ive figured it out Miss	I think anyways	0.0
I think anyways	I Im doing the the measurements	3.0
You can make combinations	Oh I dont get this	2.0
Oh I dont get this	Lets get the triangle and measure everything	0.0
Yeah and and do the instructions on how to make it	Okay well whats the  gonna be because	0.0
So have you done two	One	0.0
One	Eight point seven centimeters	3.0
Eight point seven centimeters	I dont think that was necessary	1.0
I dont think that was necessary	Mines like five centimeters long	1.0
Mines like five centimeters long	Mines eight point seven	1.0
Mines eight point seven	Jessica	0.0
Jessica	Mines eight point five	1.0
Do you are you using yeah a compass to draw the	We would have to measure the	3.0
Ah right	It was 60 degrees	3.0
Thats all right	And it was six centimeters long	3.0
And it was six centimeters long	And then	0.0
And then	Six	1.0
Six	Draw a line from the top down to the	4.0
Draw a line from the top down to the	Draw a line at 40 degrees that is five point one centimeters long	4.0
Draw a line at 40 degrees that is five point one centimeters long	Miss what should we do now	2.0
Pardon	What should we do now	2.0
Have you done all of them have you	Yep	0.0
Yep	Yeah	0.0
Well did you end up working out how many instructions you actually needed for each one	Yep I needed four	3.0
You needed four what were they	Um interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	3.0
Um interval A B is vertical and measures five centimeters	Interval A C is horizontal	3.0
So if its saying horizontal its saying its at an angle arent you	Yeah	0.0
So were saying ones vertical and ones horizontal	Yeah and you um	0.0
Then youre defining the angle between them arent you	Mm Im saying its a right angle	3.0
Yes	Because interval interval A B C is a right angle	4.0
Right so did they need all those instructions to finish your triangle	Yes	0.0
Yes	Draw an arc from angle uh angle C joining to the B C which is the hypotenuse and draw a dot in any	4.0
All right so you started with a line that was vertical	Yep	0.0
And then a line that was horizontal of a certain length	Yep	0.0
And then you joined them	Yes	0.0
So what did you	And it was a right angle	3.0
Yes and the right angle so you had two sides and a right angle and then joined them	Yeah and then	0.0
Yeah and then	The arc on the arc on angle C and then join the interval	3.0
Right did you actually have to have so did you tell them what length that was	No	0.0
No	I just said join it	0.0
No you didnt have to	Which is the hypotenuse	3.0
Yes so you only needed two sides and the right angle	Yep	0.0
What did you need	Three	3.0
And what was it	Okay I took my set square and drew a straight line nine centimeters for the base	4.0
Okay I took my set square and drew a straight line nine centimeters for the base	Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square	4.0
Its well how long was the base did you say	Um nine centimeters	3.0
And so you drew a right angle as well	Yeah	0.0
Yes	Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square along the line the end on the corner and drew a straight line up six point two centimeters	4.0
Um number two I then made 90 degrees set square along the line the end on the corner and drew a straight line up six point two centimeters	Yes	0.0
Yes	Number three I then joined the both ends up with the right angle triangle	3.0
So you had the same thing you had a right angle and two sides	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And the degrees were 90 degrees so	3.0
Did you have anything different	Nope	1.0
You had the same thing	Almost	1.0
You all did right angles	Yep	0.0
So no imagination	Nope	0.0
So thats one of the think and see if you can think of the same triangle if you couldve given different instructions to have done the same triangle	Yep	0.0
See if you can all end up with different ideas	Okay	0.0
So how did you end up	Good	0.0
Good	Good	0.0
Good	We all won	0.0
We all won	We have to check them	0.0
We have to check them	I won	0.0
I won	No we all won	0.0
Yeah were were they all different	No theyre all the same	1.0
What did you end up having to write	Construct a right angle	3.0
What did you end up having to draw	Oh	0.0
Oh	Triangles	3.0
Yeah	Congruent triangles theyre all congruent	3.0
Yes but what were the instructions	Um I couldnt um	0.0
Um I couldnt um	Draw an eightcentimeter line	3.0
Yes	Um make a radius of five centimeters	3.0
Yeah	She did not say that	0.0
Yeah thats all right	Um place the point of the compass at the right end of the line and draw a circle	3.0
Of what size	Pardon	0.0
Yeah	Um with a five centimeter radius	3.0
Yeah	Um uh and make a where am I	0.0
Um uh and make a where am I	Oh make a sevencentimeter radius and draw a circle from the left end of the line	4.0
Yes	And join where the point	3.0
So what did you end up doing	The edited version	0.0
Was it all the sides all the angles a combination	Pardon	0.0
What did you end up with	All the same sides and angles	3.0
Yep you end up with all the same angles but what did you tell them to draw sides or angles	Um sides	3.0
All sides	Yeah	0.0
Did you draw all sides	Um I said an angle of 60 degrees and then but and then two lines	4.0
Which lines	The beginning line	3.0
Yes	Was A B 10 centimeters long	3.0
Yes	And then an angle of 60 degrees at A	3.0
Yes	And draw a line six centimeters long	3.0
From where	From A	3.0
So youve got two lines and an angle	Yes	0.0
And what did you end up with Tanya	Uh	0.0
Yours were all lines as well	Yes	0.0
Yes	Draw an eightcentimeter interval	3.0
Right	Make a radius of five centimeters draw an arc make a radius of six	4.0
Make a radius of five centimeters draw an arc make a radius of six	Draw an arc from H bisecting arc from X to form point N	4.0
Bisect oh you mean intersecting	Oh crumbs	0.0
So youd end up with three sides	No no yes it was	0.0
Yeah rightyo	Whats the difference between bisect and	2.0
Bisecting means to cut it in half	Half yeah	0.0
Half yeah	Bi bi	0.0
Bi bi	But it did bisect it	3.0
But it did bisect it	It cut it in half	3.0
It depends on how long the line is	It was half a line	3.0
Yes Louise	How many times do you have to go through them	0.0
Are you finished	Is that all	0.0
Yes	Shes just go to do hers	0.0
Rightyo	We did all ours and they all figured it out	0.0
Yes	Um with Louises we did	0.0
When you cut them out you usually cut them out to see if they fit	Yeah but	0.0
Yeah but	but they the angles were all the same	3.0
but they the angles were all the same	We measured the angles and all that	3.0
Rightyo	Um with Louises she didnt give us any angles	1.0
Yeah thats okay	But with um mine I gave the angles is that is that all right	3.0
So which angles do you which angles did you give	I gave a five centimeter line and then a right angle with another five centimeter line	4.0
And did you do anything different Nerida	Yes and Neridas is good	0.0
Yes and Neridas is good	I like Neridas	0.0
I like Neridas	Oh sorry	0.0
Yeah so what did you start with	Um	0.0
Um	I started with a six centimeter line going horizontally	3.0
Yes	And then found halfway three centimeters and put a dot	3.0
And then found halfway three centimeters and put a dot	You put the center point of a protractor on the dot	3.0
Yes	And then you uh find 70 degrees	3.0
Yes	And you draw a line then put a dot	4.0
And you draw a line then put a dot	Then you connect um the top point to the bottom right point of the sixcentimeter line	4.0
Yeah	And Neridas see how she has  like that	0.0
Yes	And then you you put the pencil on the top dot again and draw it to the  left hand side	3.0
Well that was very different	I liked hers cause she had like	1.0
So you ended up with an angle there didnt you	Yep	0.0
Havent you	Yeah	0.0
So youve ended up with two triangles	Yep	0.0
That one and that one	Yep	0.0
That one had a line a line and an angle	Yep	0.0
That one had an angle a line and a line as well	Yep	0.0
Is everyone nearly finished	Yes	0.0
If Ive had a look at yours girls if Ive had a look at yours see if you can draw the same triangle in a different way using different instructions	Do we write down those as well	0.0
But what did you draw	I drew a triangle	3.0
What did you start with	A six centimeter line and then I just used compass points and joined them	4.0
The length of three sides	No I but I didnt include the length of length	3.0
Yes	I just I just said um draw a six centimeter line set your compass to three centimeters and draw an arc from each end and draw it	4.0
So that ones three centimeters and how long is that one	I dont know the compa yeah thatd be three centimeters	3.0
So youve done two the length of the bottom line and the length of each side	No the length of this like how much apart	3.0
Yeah well thats that determines the length of a line doesnt it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
So what have you done the same	No um	1.0
Youve done something different	Used a ruler and protractor	3.0
And what did you do	Um did eight centimeter line	3.0
Yes	And then I got the protractor and did 60 degrees	3.0
Yes	And join that and then join these together and found the measurements of the	4.0
So you found the length of that	Yeah six centimeters	3.0
Right so its two sides and an angle	Yeah	0.0
Whats yours Justine	Um with a protractor	3.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
First of all you started with a line didnt you	Oh yeah	0.0
Yep	And then 60 degrees	3.0
Right so you draw a line 60 degrees here	And then thats six centimeters	3.0
So the angle had to be between the two lines	Yes I put that in my notes two sides must be of the angle	3.0
Must two sides must be	The two like the two cause you said the minimum and I said the two sides must be of the angle	3.0
All right so its the two sides of the angle yes	Yeah	0.0
Helen	Is it different if you just if you say both angles	3.0
Yes it is	I just did it that way because you said	0.0
So youve got a a line	A line and then A B	3.0
A B	And at A you make it 60 degrees and just draw a line intersecting	4.0
Yes	And at B youd make an angle 37 degrees	3.0
Yep	Until their intersecting	3.0
Yes Kate	Uh another way is you get	0.0
And whats the other one Kate	And you draw a 90 degree angle	3.0
Yes	And you join the other side up	3.0
And you join the other side up	Join the two ends	3.0
You said Ive got a 90 degree angle what else are you going to tell me	The length	3.0
So youve got the length of that side and the length of that side is that the same as anything Ive done	No	0.0
No	Like the bisecting ones	3.0
Youve got the bisecting one	The two sides and an angle	3.0
Yes	Is it	0.0
No	Doesnt doesnt the two angles add up	3.0
Yeah	Yes yes thats right	0.0
Yes yes thats right	The the angle up the top	3.0
Yeah	Has those two angles have to add up to 90 degrees	3.0
They have to add up to 90 degrees but if I define the three angles will I get congruent triangles	Um	0.0
Um	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
Why not	Because theyll be different lengths	4.0
This one is written as can you guess	S S S	3.0
This one	A A S	3.0
Question one on activity seventeen point one	S S	3.0
S S	Miss can I	0.0
Yep	What is S S S	2.0
Can you see that	Oh	0.0
Ill also check your homework	You said that was due Friday	0.0
Okay so did you do your homework	Hows that	0.0
Hows that	That that	0.0
It was pretty easy you just had to say which sides were equal	What about	0.0
Ill write these down next lesson anyhow and go over it	Oh	0.0
Did you do your homework	Yes	0.0
Good	I did actually I accidentally did two and two as well	0.0
I did actually I accidentally did two and two as well	Like I did number two on the other page too	0.0
These ones	No I did these ones too	0.0
Did you realize	Yes	0.0
Have you done your homework	Um yes I did	0.0
Um yes I did	I did those and these chapter seven through	0.0
Yeah you did exactly the same thing Helen	Um yeah	0.0
Okay	D equals D	3.0
Okay	Which activity is it	0.0
Seventeen point one youre doing	Thats not 17 oh	0.0
So just start those	Okay	0.0
Good okay	Its very messy	0.0
Mikala	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I did the other homework	0.0
Okay thats when you didnt do it the other day	Yeah	0.0
Elise you did werent here	I was in bed	0.0
Pardon	I was in bed with mumps	0.0
So you know you understand what were doing today	No	0.0
Congruent triangles have exactly the same three sides equal and three angles equal	Oh	0.0
Have a look at the beginning of the chapter of it and it will say that um that sheet I gave you	Oh okay	0.0
So its just saying three sides are equal and three angles are equal	Oh okay thats pretty easy	0.0
Howd you go with the revision at beginning of the lesson	Um	0.0
Nicole did you do your homework	Yeah	0.0
So you did it okay	No I wasnt here and I didnt know about it	0.0
Yeah	I wasnt here	0.0
You were here last lesson	No	0.0
No	I I was away	0.0
Um all right okay	She was away	0.0
Yep	What page were we on	0.0
All right girls you may go	Miss what do we do with these	0.0
Dont lose them	Um do we have maths tomorrow	0.0
Why	Well because Im not going to be here tomorrow	0.0
Well because Im not going to be here tomorrow	Im going to Newcastle	0.0
Going to where	Newcastle	0.0
All right what for anything interesting	Uh yeah my sisters  competition and	0.0
Yeah	Okay well Im trying to find my	0.0
Well know what youre up to	Okay	0.0
Yes Daniel	Um what time are we gonna come back from computing	0.0
Four cubed is	Sixtyfour	3.0
One quarter of 16	Four	3.0
So three quarters	Twelve	3.0
Which one caused the difficulty	Twentyfive	3.0
Four X all cubed	Yeah	0.0
So what does four cubed mean	Four by four by four	3.0
Now anyone got any ideas as to how many chocolate chips I would have to put into my mixture so that I would end up with at least three in each cookie	Eighteen	3.0
Do you understand	Yeah	0.0
Tim Ill help you seeing you whos away today	Renee	0.0
Roll it properly	Sorry	0.0
Ive got it	Do we roll it we roll until each  three	3.0
You must keep rolling until every cookie has got three chocolate chips in it	Our dice has got all these dots in it	0.0
Any group not	Yeah	0.0
Mitch have you finished	No were unlucky	0.0
No were unlucky	Yay	0.0
Thanks girls	Um 25	3.0
Twentyfive	Twentyseven	3.0
Twentyseven	Twentytwo	3.0
Daniel	Um 36	3.0
Um 36	Fortytwo	3.0
Fortytwo	Thirtysix	3.0
Thirtysix	Twentyfive	3.0
Twentyfive	Twentynine	3.0
Twentynine	Twentyeight	3.0
Twentyeight	Thirtyone	3.0
Thirtyone	Twentyfive	3.0
Twentyfive	Twentysix	3.0
And Tam	Thirtythree	3.0
Do your frequency	Um we got 43	3.0
Who had one three one one one one one one two one and one	Yeah	0.0
Josh	That the um total that the last number in the cumulative frequency table is equal to sigma F Is equal to the sigma F	3.0
How many pieces of data do we have	Eleven	3.0
Eleven	Fourteen	1.0
Fourteen	Fourteen	1.0
Okay now think of it 14 pieces of data balanced how many on each side	Seven	3.0
Have we got any piece of data for the center	No	0.0
What are we going to have to do	Get the seven and eighth pieces of data add them together and	3.0
If it requires a decimal certainly	Could it be you get six and eight	3.0
How many pieces of data all together	Um 14	3.0
Fourteen so how many on each side	Seven	3.0
So numbers one through to	Seven	3.0
And from	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Seven	3.0
Four twentyeight over 14	which is approximately thirty point five seven	3.0
Sorry	Thirty point five seven	3.0
Anyone not	Oh I I didnt do that	0.0
Oh I I didnt do that	I had it as a fraction three and foursevenths	3.0
Okay the median the middle score which is the one we were talking about Alissa what was the seventh score	Um 28	3.0
The av average of 28 and 29	Twentyeight point five	3.0
What is the mode	The one with the highest frequency	3.0
Okay and what is that	Twentyfive	3.0
The five number summary what is the five number summary Tam	Um the lowest score the lower quartile the median the upper quartile and the highest score	3.0
Would you find those please	Can we use our calculators	0.0
Certainly yep	Im sort of stopped here	0.0
So have we used one of those pieces of data to obtain this median	No	0.0
So how many pieces are there	What do you mean	2.0
Well how many pieces of data did I have all together	Fortythree	3.0
Fortythree	Oh 22	3.0
How many pieces of data	Fourteen	3.0
So how many on each side	Seven	3.0
So the seventh and eighth piece of data is still in play	So you do one through seven	3.0
Anybody else having trouble finding the first and third quartile	Yes	0.0
Dont forget when we are finding the median we had the full 14 pieces of data yes	Yep	0.0
Yep	Yes	0.0
Data numbers one to seven on the righthand side we moved the seventh and eighth piece of data in to find the median	Yeah	0.0
Therefore the seventh and eighth piece of data can still remain in play when we are trying to find the first and third quartile	Yeah	0.0
So how many pieces of data do I now have on the righthand side	One to seven	3.0
And the lower quartile is going to be the	Four	3.0
Four	Four	1.0
Michael low score	Twentytwo	3.0
Lower quartile	Twentyfive	3.0
Median	Twentyeight point five	3.0
Upper quartile	Thirtysix	3.0
And the high score	Fortythree	3.0
Now is your scale is your scale going to start at zero	No	0.0
Low score of 22 high score of 43	Twentyone	3.0
Miles	Um so you said just then we we could start from 10 and end at say 43	3.0
Yes	Or or we could start at one or end at 50 if we wanted	3.0
You could but think of all that wasted scale and how long that scale is gonna be on your pad so that you can then fit	So it would be better from about 20 to 45	3.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Yep	Um when you when youre doing the bottom line thing do you put it like 36 twice and 25 three times on the scale d or do you just put it once	3.0
No your scale is just going to indicate those individual scores isnt it	All right	0.0
So you start What what range are you looking at	Um	0.0
Whats the range that youre going to show on your scale	Twentyone	3.0
Twentyone so you are going from 21 up to	Fortythree	3.0
So you start at 21 21 22 23 all the way up to 43	Oh okay	0.0
Yep	got to this point	3.0
got to this point	Um do we just draw a line	0.0
Draw in the box yeah	Yep	0.0
Yes	Why would it be better to start at 21 than 22	2.0
Its just that you youre not going to start your actual plot right on the extremities of your scale	Okay	0.0
Dont forget once you have completed drawing your your plot then you must show those five points on that scale yes	Mr Learoyd this is this correct	0.0
Looks all right to me	Mr Learoyd	0.0
Yep	I dont know I dont get how to like do it how to make the box plot	2.0
I dont know I dont get how to like do it how to make the box plot	Do you put down here one to 24	3.0
Now youve gotta On your plot youre going to have to show those five numbers yes	Yeah	0.0
So you might just start at 20 and go up to 45	Oh so it doesnt have to be  22	3.0
Rather than have your plot start on the extremity of your scale and finish on the extremity of your scale you could have a little bit each side	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	23 24 25	3.0
Because its going to be very difficult with a scale like that to actually determine what the exact median for example is	So thats not right here	3.0
So thats not right here	So thats not right	3.0
Yes thats right but you now have to show what scale the scale that you used on the actual line there dont you	Yeah	0.0
Where did you start	On this	0.0
Did you start at 22	Yep 22	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Okay	Um so we dont put we dont put the um  the the five points	3.0
Thats correct	Okay	0.0
Yep	Okay	0.0
What is this point here	Twentyfive	3.0
This point here	Thirtysix	3.0
What was that point there	Twentyeight point five	3.0
This one	Thirtysix	3.0
And the last	Fortythree	3.0
Fortythree	Fortythree	1.0
You agree	Yes	0.0
Yes	Mm hm	1.0
Yes	If you just told them the range wouldnt they be able to determine all of the other values	3.0
Sorry say that again	If you just told them the range wouldnt they be able to figure out the other values	3.0
Well what is the range	Um	0.0
Beg your pardon	Oh no I think I missed that one	3.0
High score minus low score so what is the range	Twentyone	3.0
Yes	Is this right	0.0
That looks good	All right	0.0
Here Josh	Yes please	0.0
Where have you indicated the exact value of that point	Oh so we have to write it in	0.0
So that is twentyeight point five thats it	Is this right Mr Learoyd	0.0
Take the cover off your calculator	Can we clear all the stuff in it	0.0
Everyone at that stage	Yes	0.0
Everyone got that screen	Yeah	0.0
And just before we go on there How many chocolate chips do you think you would need to ensure that you ended up with three	Twelve million of em	0.0
Twelve million of em	At least 40	3.0
At least	Forty	3.0
Forty	Theres no way you could tell because if all the cookies all of the chips	1.0
But using using the information that we gathered from that little thing	Twentynine	3.0
Twentynine	About 30	3.0
So where are you getting these figures from	From the mean	3.0
From the mean	The mean	1.0
So you are electing in this case to use the mean	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yep	Cause thats on an average of um all of the things	4.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Cause its the largest number  get	4.0
And you were looking at ensuring that every cookie had three chocolate chips in it	You make a separate batch for each one for each cookie	3.0
Youre joking	Mix up mix up the	3.0
Mix up mix up the	Well thats thats a way to ensure it	1.0
Well thats thats a way to ensure it	Mix up the pan mix up the the um dough	1.0
Yeah	Put it on the pan and then put three things in each one	3.0
Oh I see	Yeah	0.0
Theres no fellow sitting there poking in the same number of uh chips is there	Ha ha ha	0.0
And they would have some quality control and quantity control to ensure that there are a minimum number of chocolate chips	They base it on weight	3.0
They base it on weight	They what they do is they say each cookie say weigh weighs um say X number of grams	1.0
Yeah	If they if its under then well what they do is they just mix it up so that even if its a different size or shape it still weighs the same	4.0
So are you telling me that they weigh every cookie	Yep	0.0
Yep	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	After	0.0
I doubt it	Well thats what they do thats what they	3.0
Well thats what they do thats what they	My my dad says they do	1.0
Yeah	And hes a quality manufacturer	0.0
Is he	Ha ha ha	0.0
What where they make these chocolate chip cookies	Yeah	0.0
Is he	No he does different companies	0.0
Okay	But hes done it for	0.0
I guess the thirty point five seven which youd take is th uh 30 or 31 would be the number that youd pick	Yeah	0.0
There were there were a couple of scores there like the 42 and the 43 that mentioned who got the 42	We did	0.0
Okay	We got	0.0
Have a nice weekend people	Do you want these or	0.0
Bring those sheets back in on Monday please	We have to bring them in	0.0
Yeah bring them back and well just continue with that	So we can get to check them with a calculator	0.0
Michael	Sorry	0.0
Liam outside thank you	They found a better candidate	0.0
And the heading	Is that a microphone Miss	0.0
Twelve each please	Miss	0.0
Miss	Yeah	0.0
So that means that youre going to separate them into two groups on your table with how many in the first group	Five	3.0
Six in each would be	Fourteen	3.0
One to one	Eight in one group and four in the other	3.0
Which group	In the two	3.0
So I want how many piles altogether really	Two	3.0
No	Three	3.0
Okay	How did you get two piles of eight	2.0
How many blocks have you got	Three	3.0
Three	Twelve	1.0
That means on your left hand you would have	Two	3.0
Two blocks which are empty boxes and on your right hand youve got	Five	3.0
Follow that	Yeah	0.0
If youve used eight to three you should have eight empty boxes on your	Left	3.0
Left hand side and three empty boxes on your right hand side which means you have used	Eleven	3.0
Eleven	Eleven	1.0
Money now	Money	0.0
Ashley	Fifty dollars	3.0
One to three is 50 to 150	Four shares is equal	3.0
How many blocks required	Seven	3.0
You dont need a calculator to do that	You told me to get it out Miss	0.0
How would you find 30	Seven divided by	3.0
Seven divided by	Three	1.0
Write that down	Write what down	0.0
So	Yeah	0.0
Is one share six and the answer to that would be yes	So the eight would be	3.0
Nicole	Yes	0.0
So what would the ratio eight to three be	Eighteen	3.0
Do you follow whats going on	Fortyeight	3.0
Fortyeight	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Fortyeight to 18	1.0
Bobbie Jo	Easily divisible by	3.0
So try to maintain that relationship where the total number of boxes	need a	0.0
You can have a ratio of 25 to one if you want or	Forty a hundred to one	3.0
Do you have to restrict yourself to dollars	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Kilometers liters	He got eight	3.0
So youve got 10 boxes so how much is in one box	Fifty	3.0
Have you finished doing your friends question yet	No	0.0
Do you want a hand	All right	0.0
Okay	Yeah we both wrote	1.0
Yeah we both wrote	She had  because I did 121 divided by 65	1.0
You shouldnt really use the division sign like that because youre not dividing by youre dividing in	Eightyone	3.0
Eightyone	How do you	0.0
In your head though not with your calculator not with	I was just doing	0.0
What do you have to do	She had to	0.0
Four is 25	Twentyfive	3.0
Because 408 divided by 204 is only two so it should be 400 to eight	eight	0.0
eight	Miss is that	0.0
Turn around	What do we do when	0.0
Nicole	Because you only need certain	0.0
Because you only need certain	Because	0.0
Thanks	Because you might only like a certain color	4.0
How is that going to make a story that says divide 210 Smarties into the ratio two to five	One person might want color and one wants the other color	4.0
One person might want color and one wants the other color	And theres more of one color like the blue ones theres heaps of those and the brown no and then theres a color  red	4.0
Bobbie Jo	Theres seven people	3.0
How many people have you actually got here	Two	3.0
Lindsey	A	3.0
A	A	1.0
A	Um  to what person B	1.0
So I had some Smarties and person A stole some	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Person B stole some from person A	3.0
Person B stole some from person A	Person B pays	1.0
Not Smarties this time something else	Marbles	0.0
Marbles surfboards	I think Smarties	0.0
Bodyboards	Ah Skittles	0.0
We have 210 bodyboards and we want them divided in the ratio two to five	Eight	3.0
What is it	No she said she said ones a pro surfboard ones just a beginner	0.0
Bodyboards	In a shop	0.0
In a shop	On the shore	0.0
A or B	B	3.0
B	A	1.0
A would be the amateur and they get how many boards would they have got	Thirty	3.0
Six boards and 15	You wouldnt even need you just need one	0.0
But make a ratio and a quantity and write down a story for that question	I didnt get to work my ratio out Miss	2.0
All right	Yeah	0.0
Okay	There were 11 boxes and 77 apples	3.0
There were 11 boxes and 77 apples	Three were  and eight	3.0
Yeah	That would	0.0
How many went to market	Three	3.0
Three	What happened to my story	0.0
Isnt that right	Well I said that	0.0
But you dont need to tell that in the story because thats what the person has to work out	Seventyseven apples	3.0
That would be why they would divide it in a different ratio	Jessica needs help Miss	0.0
Listening to Teague	No Jessica needs help first	0.0
No Jessica needs help first	story makes sense	0.0
story makes sense	No	0.0
Why not	Because they thought they already had stories but then they read mine and realized they didnt	0.0
So you have a good story that you can	No its not good	0.0
No its not good	It is	0.0
Well itll do	Ill read it for her	0.0
Okay	Okay two basketball players were comparing how many points they had in their NBL careers	4.0
Okay two basketball players were comparing how many points they had in their NBL careers	They had a ratio of one to one	4.0
Shh Katie	They jointly scored five thousand fiftyfive	3.0
Come on now please	Two basketball players were comparing how many plays they had in their NBL career	4.0
Two basketball players were comparing how many plays they had in their NBL career	They had a ratio of one to one	4.0
They had a ratio of one to one	They both scored five fiftyfive thousand six hundred fortynine points	4.0
They both scored five fiftyfive thousand six hundred fortynine points	Together they equaled	4.0
Together they equaled	One hundred and eleven thousand two hundred and ninetyeight	1.0
Yeah so thats a good story but wheres the actual question if you were going to make it into a question for someone to do	My question was um one to one equals I mean one for the ratio of one equals 111298	4.0
So really your question would have boiled down to divide 111000 in the ratio one to one	Yeah	0.0
Danny	I havent finished Miss	0.0
All right well Ill give you	either	0.0
Well you lets just go with what youve got then eh	What to say the story	0.0
Yep	We didnt have a story	0.0
We didnt have a story	Its just like	0.0
Thatll be fine	One to four	3.0

Danny	Yes	0.0
Read me what you have please	There was 30 lollies	4.0
There was 30 lollies	One man got 10 lollies the other got 20 therefore the ratio was 10 to 20	4.0
Anybody else got a good story	There is a Mars Bar competition and you can win a free Mars Bar	4.0
There is a Mars Bar competition and you can win a free Mars Bar	Um five in six are losers and the shop has 121 Mars Bars how many Mars Bars are losers	4.0
Did you understand the question Colin	Yep	0.0
However do you actually think the Mars Bar company would have a ratio of five to six of winners and losers	No	0.0
No	Um five are the losers and then the last one	3.0
Is that likely	Probably not	0.0
Lets do winners first to losers	Give me a pen	0.0
Give me a pen	One to 10	3.0
Emma	One to six	3.0
One to six	One to five	3.0
One to five	Two to 10	3.0
Same thing isnt it	On that on that ad thing they have one to six	3.0
On the on the ad	Or was it four	3.0
Or was it four	That was one to six	1.0
That was one to six	That was one to three	1.0
That was one to three	It used to be	0.0
So theres a is there an ad	Yeah	0.0

Me	Yeah I told her you	0.0
Instead of slash we use dotdot	Oh he told me to use the slash	0.0
Lets say you move back a little bit so youre out of reach	So you dont	0.0
Thats right	Id have to do	0.0
And	And no	0.0
Four of them	Four of them	0.0
Which question is it	Four twenty	0.0
Four twenty	Divide 420 in the ratio of seven to one	0.0
So how many lots do you have	Four	3.0
One share	Thirtyfour	3.0
How did you work that out	Four twenty divided by 12	3.0
Four twenty divided by 12	Thirtyfive	1.0
One share equals 35 so then youd have to just do seven times 35 and five times 35	Three fortyfive	3.0
Three fortyfive	They got the answer	0.0
You right now then	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How come you have to get that microphone	0.0
So they can listen to me talking to you	So they cant hear us but they can hear you	0.0
Yes	How can I use this to bribe my mom to get me some Smarties	0.0
All right	Ill need Ill need a few	0.0
You cant eat the Smarties	Oh	0.0
Okay you make a prediction first	My prediction is 12	3.0
How many	I said my prediction is 12 and you got to	3.0
I said my prediction is 12 and you got to	Its twelve	1.0
And you write two in the frequency	Ive got lots of blues	0.0
Ive got lots of blues	Ive got five	0.0
Who	You got 51	3.0
You got 51	No	1.0
Itll be easier wont it	and just makes it even	3.0
and just makes it even	Okay now you can  Miss	0.0
Well the blue equals none brown is one red is three	Are we done  now Miss	0.0
Id like it complete	What do you have to complete	0.0
What do you have to complete	Just the	0.0
Tallys the working column and frequencys the answer	Everything Miss	0.0
Everything Miss	Oh Im hungry	0.0
But we dont really need a work column so	Look at these theyre very tempting	0.0
Look at these theyre very tempting	And now Ive got to	0.0
Yes I think so	Miss can we eat this after we just calculate the frequency	0.0
Hes got 13	What does it mean by frequency	2.0
Frequency means how many	How do you work out percentage	2.0
That would be two out of six which is a third	Its thirtythree point three three	3.0
How many did you have Jessica	Thirteen	3.0
Thirteen	Twelve	3.0
Anybody have 14	I had 13	3.0
Especially if youve got 13 because its an awkward number	Do you have to write down three over six times 100	3.0
No the tally is the working column for the frequency	What if you have zero	2.0
I already know a third is 33 and a third	How would you work out like to continue working without a	0.0
How are you going to continue working without a biro	Im not going to  my calculator	0.0
Did you happen to remember a calculator today	Its broken	0.0
What for	I didnt have any blues any browns one green	3.0
No that cant be right	No oranges four pinks	3.0
Like pink yeah orange and black equal	Do you know any	0.0
Eightthirds	Good choice	0.0
What	Ive got 21 six seven	3.0
Did you when you add them up make it six repeater and three repeater or just six and three	Just six and three	3.0
Oh then thats where you probably youve got a	I got  left  ninenine	3.0
Is that a three or an eight	Eight	3.0
Eight	Eight point three	3.0
You have the assignment that I gave you which is due Friday	Friday	0.0
The one about the replica of the first fleet	Oh that	0.0
So Marcela explain	So diagonals are split into halves with the help of the Pythagorean theorem well figure out the length of each side	3.0
The attribute of the diagonals youve explained one point is discovered is there any other	Its	0.0
Psst Dan	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	It has all the sides the same	3.0
So how do you explain or how do you convince us that this triangle	Because the diagonals are perpendicular to each other	4.0
So Marcela speak out loud so everybody knows what youre writing on the board	Plus  divided by two	3.0
Yes	A is equal to the second root of 12 divided by two and square the whole formula plus seven divided by two and square the second formula	4.0
So when you substitute	A is equal to second root of six square	3.0
Uh huh	Plus  plus three point five	3.0
What is it	Twelve point twentyfive	3.0
Twelve point twentyfive	Six point six point eight	3.0
What did the calculator show you	Six point eight  nine four	3.0
Okay okay so its six point you said eight	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Its six point nine	3.0
So Marcela what else	is equal	3.0
So well try it without a calculator what would it be	It is twentyseven point six	3.0
So do you all have the same answer	Yes	1.0
Already yourself	I transferred it	3.0
Id like to calculate the length of diagonal of this parallelepiped	So Im going to make a sketch	3.0
So lets start with a sketch	A diagonal	4.0
A diagonal	Ill inscribe the sides of the parallelepiped	4.0
And you have to speak out loud so they can hear you all the way here in the back	A  B  C	3.0
The edges yes	The edges	0.0
The edges	Now Im going to calculate the side A G	3.0
And now its up to you how were going to calculate it	So we will separate it on one side to A B C and well mark it as a rightangled triangle	3.0
So you meant a wall not a side a wall yes so walls A B C and D we can use	A wall	0.0
A wall	walls A B C D  a short diagonal to the right	3.0
And loud Dan you have to speak out loud so we can understand what youre saying	So these are  A  B and this is going to be a diagonal lets call it for example X	3.0
Yes	So now we can easily figure it out so X equals a root of A squared plus B squared because its a hypotenuse	4.0
Yes	So X equals a root of 32 squared plus 46 squared	3.0
So Dan take your calculator or over there on the table you can borrow one	So Ill write it down	0.0
So Ill write it down	Its a root of 1024 plus 2016	3.0
Uh huh	Ill add it together so its a root of 3140	3.0
Yes	And the result is 56	3.0
So by doing this we calculated what	A wall diagonal	3.0
Okay what is next	Now	0.0
Yes	So now we get a rightangled triangle A C G	3.0
Yes so draw the triangle again	This is going to be A this is C and this is G and this is going to be  Y	3.0
So this is clear	Rightangled	4.0
Rightangled	So this is practically the  C and this the wall diagonal X and we have to calculate the Y	4.0
So this is practically the  C and this the wall diagonal X and we have to calculate the Y	So Y is equal because its a hypotenuse its a root of X squared plus C squared	4.0
Yes	So Y is equal to the root of 56 squared plus 53 squared and Y is equal where is the calculator	4.0
So you borrow this calculator again	So its the root of 3136 plus 2809 Y equals the root of 5945	4.0
Uh huh	And that is seventyseven point one seventyseven point one centimeters	3.0
So Dan before I let you go tell me how many decimeters it would be	Seven point seventyone decimeters	3.0
Everybody has seen an easel	Two point what	2.0
Katka	Rightangled	3.0
Rightangled	Rightangled	1.0
Good	I have already	0.0
Is it the same	Yes	1.0
We agreed were going to have the measurements with one decimal space so well round the answer on two decimal spaces	On two	0.0
So Marcela you start	Four plus three times two squared is four plus three times two and that is 16	4.0
Zuzko	Four plus three times two squared that equals four plus six squared is equal to 40	4.0
Yes that is 40 Dan	Four plus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to seven times two squared and that is 28	4.0
Petra	Four plus three times two in parenthesis raised to the second power is equal to 100	4.0
Katka	Four minus three times two squared is equal to four minus 12 and that is minus eight	4.0
Take another one	Four minus three times two squared is equal to four minus six squared and that is minus 32	4.0
Jonas	Four minus three in parenthesis times two squared is equal to one times four is four	4.0
Martina	Four minus three times two in parenthesis squared is equal to four minus six all raised to the second power and that equals four	4.0
So Jana talk and explain what youre doing there	So the parenthesis come first so its eight divided by four by four is 16 is eight divided by 16 minus two	4.0
Jonas	Zero point five	3.0
Where would you get the minus	I dont know	2.0
Or anyone has the answer in a different form	One half	3.0
So	So the root of four is two three divided so five	4.0
So dont forget its equal at the beginning make another one at the beginning at the beginning so	Three divided by two is one point five five minus one point five is three point five	4.0
So Jirka for you we have five plus and in the parenthesis three divided by four the parenthesis squared	So its five plus uh three divided by four is zero point uh	4.0
So its five plus uh three divided by four is zero point uh	Seventyfive	1.0
Yes that is coming let him be let him be	Seventyfive 75	3.0
It looks a little weird	Seventyfive	3.0
Now you tell me what youre going to do next with the formula when you should raise by two	So Im going to raise it by two	3.0
How	Similar to the easel	3.0
Shh shh stop that	Well well draw it	3.0
Go back go back to the three fractioned by four three divided by four okay so now Ive said that	Fraction	3.0
What is this form called	This is a complex fraction	3.0
How is it called	Mixed	3.0
So Teresa come to do another one	But when we had the easel we did it differently	0.0
Entirely the whole thing squared	Five minus three is two divided by the root of four is two and the whole formula squared	4.0
Yes	So its two divided by two that is one squared and that is equal	4.0
Which is equal	One	3.0
Read it	Fill in the blanks the correct answers of signs for bigger and smaller	0.0
So Dada do the first one	So its two squared plus two squared is equal to two times two squared so two squared plus two squared is eight	4.0
Eight	And two by two squared is also eight	4.0
Petra	Two squared plus two cubed oh I have to do example B two cubed plus two cubed is bigger than three times two squared	4.0
So	Because the cube of two plus the cube of two is 18	4.0
Because the cube of two plus the cube of two is 18	Sixteen	1.0
Sixteen	Sixteen	1.0
So how much is the cube of two Petra	The cube of two is eight	3.0
Eight so on the left side the answer is 16 and on the right side	Sixteen	3.0
Sixteen	And three by two squared is 12	4.0
Twelve so	So the 16 is bigger than 12	3.0
The left side is bigger than the right one Jitka	So two squared plus two cubed is equal to three by two squared	4.0
So what did you get on the left side	So its basically four plus eight which is 12 and three by four is also 12	4.0
So in example C we have say it one more time an equal symbol good Karin take another one	An equal symbol	0.0
An equal symbol	Two cubed plus two squared will be eight plus four	4.0
Jirka stop doing that	Which is 12 and that is smaller than two times two cubed because its like two times eight 16	4.0
The sum of numbers three and five well convert into words how	Three plus five	3.0
The difference between numbers four and minus eight	Four minus minus eight	3.0
The product means what Misa	Multiplying	3.0
And quotient	Dividing	3.0
So Andrea try the first one	A four power of difference of numbers five and three	3.0
Now look next to it how they wrote it down	Five minus three in the parenthesis to the fourth power	4.0
So if were going to calculate it what do we have to do first	Put it in the parenthesis	3.0
First we have to do the calculation in parenthesis and after that raise it to a certain power	Parenthesis and raise it to a certain power	0.0
So what kind of calculating am I starting with in this word expression	With the power	3.0
With the power which means with the process which were going to be using for calculating as the last one	The last one	3.0
First we have to subtract and when we have the answer well raise it to a certain power okay	Raise it to a certain power	3.0
Teresa	The difference of fourth powers of numbers five and three	0.0
First we should calculate what	First were going to calculate the fourth power	3.0
First were going to calculate the fourth powers and later the answers well subtract	Well subtract	0.0
Do you understand that	Yes	0.0
Lucko read the next one	Five multiplied by the sum of the numbers 12 and three	0.0
So if we want to calculate it first we start with what	First we calculate the parenthesis which is 12 plus three	3.0
Twelve plus three and the answer we multiply it by five	Multiply by five	0.0
The one before the last one	The square root of the sum of 11 and seven	3.0
And now well read the last one so you have something to compare it to Pepo what is going to be the last one	The total sum of square roots of numbers 11 and seven	0.0
When I start saying second root of the total so the main part is the big root mark	The root mark	0.0
And in the last one you have the sum of the square roots	Square roots	0.0
Katko	The difference of numbers 15 and nine is 15 minus nine is six	4.0
And the answer is	Its equal to six	3.0
Marketa	Fifteen times nine is 135 and its a product of numbers 15 and nine	4.0
So Dan read the next one	Sixtyfour divided by eight is eight	0.0
Karin	Seventeen plus 12 is 29	4.0
Alino	Fifteen plus two times nine is 33	4.0
Dont forget about it lets remember it	The multiplication	3.0
Jitko	In parenthesis 15 plus nine the end of parenthesis times four is equal to 96	4.0
Dado	Two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis plus two times 15 plus nine in parenthesis	4.0
So what is the answer	Fortyeight	3.0
Are the parenthesis necessary there or we can get by without them	We have to have them	3.0
Yes we have to have the parenthesis here so lets move on Katka	May I ask something	0.0
May I ask something	About the multiplying by two	0.0
About the multiplying by two	Does it matter if its in front of or after the parenthesis	0.0
So Katko show me what we have here	If I look at the answer it doesnt matter but its written differently	3.0
So tell me what you have there	Fifteen plus nine in parenthesis by two	3.0
So its this way or what kind of different version did you want	Two by the whole parenthesis	3.0
So	The answer is the same but if I write it the other way is there any difference	0.0
How do we explain that the answer has to be the same no matter what way we write it down	Because its commutative	4.0
Multiplying is commutative	Its commutative	3.0
Zuzko	Fifteen times two plus nine times two is equal to 48	4.0
Are they necessary or not	They are not	3.0
So for you I have with the difference of numbers three and seven	May I write it with	0.0
Petro there is the quotient of five and eight do you have it there	Now she does	0.0
Now she does	Dont transcribe it into a fraction	3.0
If its possible do it that way	Into a fraction or into a mixed number	2.0
One whole number has how many eighths	Eight	3.0
And four of them	Is thirtytwo	3.0
So its minus thirtytwo eighths plus five eighths is	Minus 28	3.0
Thirtytwo without five	Twentyseven	3.0
Youll write it down and calculate it	So the	0.0
Because if you recall how to determine for example what	Perimeter	3.0
Perimeter of what	Square	3.0
Perimeter of a square youll be able to remember that yes	Four times A	3.0
Paul	Four times A	3.0
If you have this type of figure	Two times A	3.0
Two times A	Symbol S	1.0
Thats debatable	The area	3.0
What are we trying to figure out	The perimeter	3.0
If were looking for the perimeter then the symbol will be	O	3.0
And you know	O equals two times A plus two times B	3.0
Nicolie	A to the second power plus B to the second power	3.0
I think you overdid it with that one wouldnt you say	A to the second power times B	3.0
Excuse me	Two times A plus B	3.0
We add A plus B and multiply yes so	By two	3.0
You also know how to figure out a triangle yes	O equals A plus B plus C	3.0
John	You somehow draw a square	3.0
Where	May I come up to the board	0.0
What does this correspond to	Radius	3.0
To what	Secant of circumference	3.0
What is this	Radius	3.0
Excuse me	Length of the square	3.0
And what does this blue segment in the circumference mean	Linear equation	3.0
Michael	Its not accurate	1.0
Which more accurate method should I use	I would try to divide it into four segments	3.0
With what	Through center S	3.0
Through center S and then what once you divide it up	Well in order to find out the radius to know the radius of the circumference I multiply the radius by four	4.0
Well in order to find out the radius to know the radius of the circumference I multiply the radius by four	When I will have three centimeters times four	4.0
Well why four times for instance	Because Ill divide it into four pieces	4.0
Because Ill divide it into four pieces	Yes but	1.0
Yes	Thats the same thing as if I divided it in eight pieces and that would be the same	2.0
And there is a lot more of them	Could I draw the square in the inside	3.0
The diameter in the square is	Diagonal	3.0
The perimeter in this case the perimeter of a square would be a problem in this case why because you dont know	The lengths	3.0
So you cannot determine the perimeter of the square	So I would for example use an octagon	3.0
Where can you easily determine the sides	Triangle	3.0
Stanley	Hexagon	3.0
And what ever comes out of that is what	Hexagon	3.0
What is the length of one side	Radius of the circumference	3.0
The length of one side of the hexagon is the length of the radius	It still isnt accurate	3.0
So how would you define it more precisely	Hexahedron	3.0
Hexahedron	Dodecagon octagon	3.0
Which one	Dodecagon	3.0
Then you can do a icositetragon	Forty	3.0
Tetraconiakaioctagon	Would that work	0.0
You would not be able to figure it out not even the twelfth angle	But more of the angles	3.0
is arriving to one thing that the perimeter of a square has four diameters the perimeter of a hexagon Philip	Six	3.0
Six of what	Diameters	3.0
Diameters	Radius	1.0
Diameter and radius	The radius is half of the diameter	3.0
And the two times R is	Diameter	3.0
Note the length of the circumference depends on what do you think it depends on	Diameter	3.0
Do you also remember the equation of that	K equals three	3.0
What about the actual formula	Y equals K over X	3.0
Is it going to be four	No No	0.0
So where is the letter A going to be	Between the two	3.0
Lets write that instead of K Paul please complete it	Pi pi pi	3.0
Martin	Half	3.0
How should I write it up	Two times R	3.0
Make a note Stanley	Perimeter equals	3.0
Why are you changing it	Diameter and then I can change it to	3.0
Yes	We will convert to decimeters	3.0
I still dont understand the logic of why you switched the numbers	I know it like this	0.0
One more time	I believe I have to know the diameter	3.0
You dont know the number of Pi	I know	0.0
Why dont you choose the numbers	Three point fourteen	3.0
And how about problem E	You have  that should have been nine point one hundred and six thousandths	3.0
Do you all understand it	Yes	0.0
You calculated it to the nearest tenth point and the result comes out to 10 numbers so you can round off to approximately	Approximately	0.0
Thirty	Hundredths	3.0
Nikolai	Yes	0.0
Give us an example of a powered number	Five squared	3.0

Oh	From here to here	3.0
Or	From here to here	3.0
Thats thats right	Teacher	0.0
Yes	Uhm this and this are	0.0
Hm	parallel so	3.0

What is it	Huh	0.0
Huh	You got to be kidding me	0.0
You got to be kidding me	If you draw the parallel lines and why it becomes like this why	3.0
Well you see	Yes	0.0
You look at it like this	For now please explain it one more time	2.0
If you do that this will become the same like last time	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thats right huh	0.0

Is this just this side	Its also over here	3.0
Oh	I cant do it even with this	0.0
The area over here and over here	Over here	0.0
Seems somewhat	Ill give up A B	3.0
Ill give up A B	Yes	1.0
I think its okay okay but	Oh	0.0
When we cut it like this and did it	Now	0.0
Now	Its okay	3.0
Its okay	The base is the same	1.0
Are the areas of the triangles the same	Over here and over here are the same	3.0
Over here and over here are the same	Over here and over here are also the same	1.0
Over here and over here are also the same	I think its better if we dont let himher do it	0.0
I think its better if we dont let himher do it	What	0.0
What	The end and the end are the same and	1.0
Its okay if this and this are the same right	Its not the same	3.0
Okay	Im saying you cant draw it	3.0
Good	Stop it	0.0
Stop it	Stop it okay	0.0
Stop it okay	Stop it okay	0.0
Please return to your seats	Teacher hes drawing extra things	0.0
Dont write it	Teacher	0.0

Okay	Since they are equal so	3.0
Okay then	Am I doing it	0.0
Good luck	I dont understand it very well	2.0
I dont understand it very well	Teacher please listen to me	0.0
Okay	Hes not listening	0.0
Hes not listening	Jimbo	0.0
Go ahead	Is Chiba going to do it	0.0
Is Chiba going to do it	Its not me right	0.0
Please do it	This is okay	0.0
This is okay	Hm	0.0
Hm	First of all we make a triangle okay	3.0
First of all we make a triangle okay	What are you saying	0.0
What are you saying	You talk too much	0.0
You talk too much	You make a triangle right	1.0
You make a triangle right	And then here	1.0
And then here	His face is completely in the camera	0.0
His face is completely in the camera	s	0.0
s	Draw a line para para parallel over here also and we make over here as the base	1.0
Draw a line para para parallel over here also and we make over here as the base	As the base	0.0
As the base	Here	0.0
Here	Yes	1.0
Yes	And then we make it the height and this triangle and	3.0
And then we make it the height and this triangle and	Thats the height	1.0
Thats the height	Okay	0.0
Okay	Which is it	2.0
Which is it	I think its not that	1.0
I think its not that	This triangle and a tri somewhere	1.0
The red triangle	Oh	0.0
Oh	Its this right	3.0
Yes	The red triangle is	0.0
The red triangle is	The area is	0.0
Over here	What is it	0.0
What is it	Ya	0.0
Ya	Well they are the same okay	3.0
The tri over here	Actually and the triangle over here	0.0
Yes	The fact is that the areas are the same okay	3.0
Hm	Since the base and the height are the same so	4.0
Since the base and the height are the same so	So first of all the fact is we can draw a line here	4.0
So first of all the fact is we can draw a line here	Yes yes	0.0
Yes yes	Well I dont know what I am saying but	2.0
We can understand enough right	Oh	0.0
Oh	You understand	0.0
You dont understand	I also dont understand	2.0
People who didnt understand it please listen to it closely okay	First of all	0.0
First of all	After this	0.0
After this	The place that has a weird place like this	3.0
The place that has a weird place like this	I got it	0.0
I got it	In the place that is below this like this draw a line and uhm we make it into a triangle okay	4.0
In the place that is below this like this draw a line and uhm we make it into a triangle okay	Ha then this	0.0
Ha then this	This	0.0
This	Something that has this side as a base	4.0
Something that has this side as a base	That has it as a base	4.0
That has it as a base	Draw a line that is parallel to this base by fitting it with this apex	4.0
Draw a line that is parallel to this base by fitting it with this apex	And then the parallel line hm	4.0
And then the parallel line hm	Since the length of base doesnt change so and in between the parallel lines always	4.0
The height is e	The height doesnt change so like this	3.0
The height doesnt change so like this	Up to wherever you draw it anywhere you draw it	3.0
Yes	the area doesnt change with this this triangle that we got first	4.0
the area doesnt change with this this triangle that we got first	So uhm its just that even if we draw up to this best places end	4.0
So uhm its just that even if we draw up to this best places end	for this triangle and this yellow this triangle the areas dont change	4.0
Okay begin	We cant open our textbooks	0.0
Right	This	0.0
This	Teacher can we open our textbooks yet	0.0
You cant do it with it just as it is right	I dont change this	3.0
If it becomes wha what sided shape can you do the problem	Triangle	3.0
If its just as it is its a quadrilateral right	So were to make a quadrilateral into a triangle	3.0
If everybody had a triangle and parallel lines then they can do it huh	Huh	0.0
Thats right	Teacher the one we call the triangle isnt just one	3.0
Huh	One	3.0
No	In addition	3.0
It may be that you can get many types huh	Is it okay with two	3.0
Youre sharp	Huh	0.0
How can we do it	Triangle	3.0
Since you cant do it just as it is so	What are you saying	0.0
Hm	Huh	0.0
Okay	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Teacher	0.0
Its also fine for people who dont understand to ask me	Oh	0.0
Oh	But I dont think its limited to one	3.0
But I dont think its limited to one	There is one more	1.0
There is one more	Teacher	0.0
Yes	This is okay	0.0
Yes	How many	0.0
How many	How many do I make	0.0
I wonder how many can you make	Is it okay with one	0.0
Its okay if first of all you get one but	With one zero	3.0
Theres three	How many can we make	2.0
How many can we make	This	0.0
I wonder how many all of you can mak make	Oh I see	0.0
Oh I see	Thats what you mean	0.0
The answer is not just one	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thats right huh	0.0
Thats right huh	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thats right huh	0.0
Thats right huh	Oh	0.0
Oh	I got it	0.0
I got it	Its fine with this right	0.0
Its fine with this right	Huh	0.0
Huh	Its wrong	0.0
Its wrong	Huh	0.0
Huh	Now	0.0
Now	The ones I havent got yet teacher	0.0
The ones I havent got yet teacher	Wonderful	0.0
Wonderful	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Thats unfair	0.0
There is no possibility	Excuse me	0.0
Excuse me	Its okay with this right	0.0
If you got one on this side then	I can get it over here and over here from this	3.0
And cant you make a triangle over here that is the same as this	Well thats right huh	0.0
You can get it on the opposite side right	Would I know all of them doing it like that	3.0
Youll notice them If you notice them then that will be great	Am I supposed to draw all of them	0.0
I wonder how many ways it can be made	Eight	3.0
Youre sharp	I think its the same area as this quadrangle of the hint card and the notebook	3.0
Youre advanced to a good place in the problem	Yes	0.0
Yes	I got it	0.0
I got it	I got it	0.0
I got it	I got it	0.0
Yes	I got it	0.0
I got it	Well	0.0
Youve gotten up to a good place in the problem	But after th that Im having problems	2.0
Then okay	Yes	0.0
For example if the corner here becomes straight with this here and here then this is	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Parallel	3.0
Parallel	Does it have to be teacher Ebina who looks over my work	0.0
Wai Its okay to come to me to have your work looked at	Triangle	3.0
The fact is were making a triangle a quadrangle into a triangle you do what to one angle	Nagai	0.0
Nagai	Its because theres a lot of people waiting in line for teacher Ebina	0.0
Its because theres a lot of people waiting in line for teacher Ebina	Reduce	3.0
That means that to reduce angles you take one	Parallel	3.0
And also	Its okay with this line segment	3.0
You can also do this side right	The same thing	0.0
The same thing	Teacher	0.0
Please think about it in many ways	Its not just one right	3.0
Its not just one right	Is it okay with this	0.0
The fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means what happens to the number of angles	I dont understand	2.0
The number of angles goes from four to	Three	3.0
For example if here were to become straight	Draw a parallel line and	3.0
Are you done	I have gotten only one yet	0.0
Ti	Where do I draw it	0.0
Where do I draw it	Teacher I dont understand it very well but	2.0
Hm okay	Theres eight	3.0
Do you have your notebook	I do	0.0
Hm	Then look at it	0.0
Then look at it	Teacher	0.0
You cant do it as it is a quadrilateral	Its this	3.0
Yes	Its okay	0.0
And also	Here	3.0
Dont you have to draw a parallel line to the triangle	Its here	3.0
Triangle and hm	Here	3.0
Yes	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Thats funny you know	0.0
Hm	Here	3.0
Since its parallel like this so in the parallel lines where is the qua thats equal to here	This is a little off	3.0
This is a little off	Teacher	0.0
It becomes more off	Hm	0.0
Hm	here and here and  to here	3.0
Isnt there one more parallel line a triangle	Huh	0.0
The triangle is over here right	Then also over here	3.0
If you cut it like this then here with this one diagonal line would you get a triangle just over here	I can do this	0.0
I can do this	And it comes over here and	3.0
Yes	Over here is also	3.0
You noticed things like this on this side right	Uh huh	0.0
Isnt there anything like this over here okay	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh oh oh	0.0
On this side	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thats right huh	3.0
If there is a right side then there is a left side also right	How about this	2.0
And the fact that were making a quadrilateral into a triangle means that we do what to one angle	Get rid of it	3.0
If there is one on this side then how about this side	Yes	0.0
Yes	Oh	0.0
Where is it	Here if there is one then	3.0
Yes	Its somewhere here huh	3.0
Thats right  keeps on bending and the angle disappears	Here	3.0
If it becomes like this then this angle	It disappears	3.0
It disappears right	Yes	0.0
And if you get one on this side then this time cant you also get it on this side	Yes	0.0
Yes	Am I to draw all of these	0.0
Am I to draw all of these	This	0.0
This	This	0.0
For this there are t two more more	Is it okay to change some	0.0
Hm	One that is a new	0.0
One that is a new	Why	2.0
If you have another one	Well its okay with it here	0.0
Can you shrink it	Uh well	0.0
Then cant you get one on this side	Still	0.0
Still	Still how do I get it	2.0
Then is this the only triangle that we can get	Oh	0.0
Oh	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Will methods like these also work Oh Im sorry	0.0
You can also do that right	Can I also do that	0.0
Hm	But this is triang	0.0
It hasnt become a diagonal line	Quadrilateral	3.0
Quadrilateral	Quadrilateral	1.0
Quadrilateral	Its no good if its a quadrilateral	1.0
Its no good if its a quadrilateral	It hasnt changed at all	1.0
It hasnt changed at all	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Ill also do one for you	0.0
First of all this diagonal line like this	Triangle like these are  okay	0.0
Please do a different one	Its like this	0.0
The diagonal line isnt done okay	In the end this is	0.0
In the end this is	Just now I made a little mistake	3.0
You made a mistake	Which diagonal line	2.0
This isnt good if its the middle point	Huh	0.0
This	Like this like this	0.0
Huh	I dont understand this	2.0
You drew it like this	Its not a triangle	3.0
Oh	Thats wrong	3.0
Thats wrong	Thats wrong	1.0
Thats wrong	Thats wrong	1.0
Thats wrong	Oh	0.0
Oh	Over here	1.0
Over here	Huh	0.0
This is where its supposed to be straight okay	Thats right	0.0
Thats right	Straight	3.0
It doesnt look straight okay	This	0.0
This	Straight	3.0
Hey its crooked	Like this	3.0
Please have it drawn neatly	Two	3.0
How many methods have you found	I dont know yet up to where I did	2.0
If it becomes like this	Also what do I do	2.0
How many methods did you get	Still only two	3.0
First of all this is correct huh	No	0.0
No	Something	0.0
Something	I thought something might be wrong	0.0
Why did you think it might be wrong	Something	0.0
Something	The base	3.0
The base	The question is where to put the base right	3.0
Youre sharp	Huh	0.0
Huh	Huh	0.0
Huh	just us	0.0
just us	Youre so noisy	0.0
Youre so noisy	Why dont you shut up	0.0
Why dont you shut up	She is so scary	0.0
She is so scary	Im not scary	0.0
How many methods did you get	Two	3.0
Are you worried thinking about it	One	3.0
You got something like this right	Yes	0.0
One that is the same as this is this right	Yes	0.0
Thats good huh	Hm	0.0
Cant you make one on th this side	This side  a lot	3.0
This side  a lot	Yes	0.0
Yes	I can	0.0
With that for now it will be two methods right	It doesnt look like it	3.0
It doesnt look like it	It doesnt look like it	1.0
It doesnt look like it	It doesnt look like it	1.0
Then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines	Over here	3.0
You can draw it right	Its easy to see huh	0.0
Are you done	Yes	0.0
How many methods did you get	Only two yet	3.0
Which is it	One like this and	3.0
One like this and	And this	3.0
And this	This	3.0
Over here huh	Hm	0.0
After you look for it	I found eight	3.0
Hm	Eight	3.0
Eight	Eight	3.0
Now then is it just this side where we can draw parallel lines	This side	3.0
Then cant you transform this triangle	Over here	3.0
this original figure has become somewhat harder to understand but	This	0.0
Is it just this side where you can get it	Over here also	3.0
Hm	Over here	3.0
On this side	We can do it	0.0
Is it just this side where we can do it	This side	3.0
Hm	No	0.0
You found eight	Yes	0.0
Thats amazing	Eight	3.0
How many did you get	Huh	0.0
How many did you get	Huh	0.0
Its okay if you get one	I could only get one	3.0
How did you get one	Can I borrow this of yours Usui	0.0
Can I borrow this of yours Usui	No way	0.0
You got one right	Yes	0.0
Then these are parallel right	Which	2.0
This and this	Huh	0.0
Huh	This	0.0
This	Yes	0.0
Then the triangle and this orangecolored object is the same right	Yes	0.0
Then do you get it only on this side	No	0.0
Which side	This side also	3.0
Already you found two	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Oh	0.0
Oh	Is it that	1.0
Yes	Oh	0.0
Oh	With here  huh	0.0
With here  huh	Oh	0.0

How about it in this stage	Ichiro	3.0
Ichiro	Ichiro	1.0
You may want to take notes or anything else you want to do is fine so please try doing it	Where are we going to write it	0.0
Have you already solved at least one	Okay	0.0
Up to wh where have you thought about it	Uh somewhat	0.0
Did you erase this	Yes	0.0
Yes	I erased that	0.0
Then how about the second day	I did this like this and	0.0
Hm	The tens	3.0
Then try putting in the dates there	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
How did you obtain this	I counted all the way	3.0
That is	Ichiro	3.0
Whose amount of money is this	Are you talking about this	0.0
Yes	Hm	0.0
Hm	Hm	0.0
Hm	This is	0.0
Hm	Well 140 yen	3.0
Then how about over here	Over here is also 90 yen	3.0
This value	Uh well	0.0
Hm	You minus 10 yen every single day and	3.0
Yes	Over here every single day	3.0
Yes	You minus five yen	3.0
And you obtained this from the table right	Yes	0.0
Okay	No	0.0
Would you present this part	Am I going to write it	0.0
So	This this what do you call this	2.0
This is smaller than	What	0.0
Smaller than	Smaller than	0.0
Will you do it	Ha ha	0.0
Ha ha	I guess Ill do it	0.0
Ha ha	Ha ha	0.0
Ha ha	What am I supposed to do	2.0
See	I put them in right	0.0
Yes	And you keep on putting them in	0.0
Okay	Its a lot faster if we put in many at a time	3.0
Its a lot faster if we put in many at a time	is more cool	0.0
Hmm	Theres a lot of 10yen coins huh	3.0
Theres a lot of 10yen coins huh	Then last the fiveyen coins go in	3.0
Then last the fiveyen coins go in	Theyre sticking out	0.0
Theyre sticking out	huh	0.0
huh	One two  three four five six	0.0
One two  three four five six	Five eight two	0.0
Five eight two	Well	0.0
Well	Huh	0.0
Huh	About this much	3.0
Hum	About this much	1.0
Hmm	About this much this time it fell	3.0
About this much this time it fell	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	Teacher	0.0
And please say it okay	No	0.0
By the way what day is this	Umm	0.0
Umm	The fifteenth day	3.0
How is it	Its okay	0.0
Its okay	Its okay	0.0
Okay	Umm	0.0
Umm	Since the fact is they put in the offertory box one coin each of money in one day so	4.0
Since the fact is they put in the offertory box one coin each of money in one day so	if we do it in an orderly fashion the number of days and also the money left over one by one	4.0
if we do it in an orderly fashion the number of days and also the money left over one by one	on the fifteenth day the smaller brother has more	4.0
That means the answer is	The fifteenth day	3.0
Go ahead	My handwriting is not neat	0.0
Then please explain it	Well in the beginning	4.0
Well in the beginning	Well Ichiro had 180 yen and the smaller brother had 110 yen	4.0
Well Ichiro had 180 yen and the smaller brother had 110 yen	And since there is a difference of 70 yen	4.0
And since there is a difference of 70 yen	and since the difference between them becomes smaller by five yen each day so its 70 divided by 10 minus five	4.0
and since the difference between them becomes smaller by five yen each day so its 70 divided by 10 minus five	And since by the fourteenth day it becomes exactly the same amount of money	4.0
And since by the fourteenth day it becomes exactly the same amount of money	so since on the day after that there will be a difference so 14 plus one is 15 and its the fifteenth day	4.0
Its okay to not write all the lines of the mathematical expression	Oh	0.0
Okay	Is it okay with this	0.0
Is it okay with this	Yes	0.0
And if you can write the amount for X	Oh	0.0
Oh	Yes	0.0
Okay	And after Ive written the answer of X and Y	0.0
Please say	Now	0.0
Now	One hundred	4.0
One hundred	In the beginning Ichiro had 180 yen and since he takes out 10 yen every day	4.0
In the beginning Ichiro had 180 yen and since he takes out 10 yen every day	And we have X as the num number of days and if we make the amount of money left Y	4.0
And we have X as the num number of days and if we make the amount of money left Y	Then it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 180 minus 10 X	4.0
Then it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 180 minus 10 X	And the smaller brother has 110 yen every day	4.0
And the smaller brother has 110 yen every day	Oh	4.0
Oh	He has 110 yen	4.0
He has 110 yen	And since he takes out five yen every day it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 110 minus five X	4.0
And since he takes out five yen every day it becomes the mathematical expression Y equals 110 minus five X	And when they become of the same amount of money and	4.0
And when they become of the same amount of money and	And X and Y becomes 14 and 40	4.0
And X and Y becomes 14 and 40	And on the fourteenth day they become the same amount of money	4.0
And on the fourteenth day they become the same amount of money	And the fourteenth day is the same amount of money	4.0
And the fourteenth day is the same amount of money	And the next day since Ichiro puts in 10 yen and the smaller brother puts in five yen so theres a difference	4.0
And the next day since Ichiro puts in 10 yen and the smaller brother puts in five yen so theres a difference	The amount of money put in is smaller for Ic Ichiro	4.0
The amount of money put in is smaller for Ic Ichiro	Oh	4.0
Oh	Its bigger so	4.0
Its bigger so	the next day Ichiro Ichiros amount of money left is less so it becomes the fifteenth day	4.0
Go ahead	Smaller	3.0
Smaller	Smaller	1.0
Smaller	What came after that	2.0
Okay	Smaller than	3.0
Smaller than	One hundred eighty minus	3.0
Yes	Ten X smaller than	3.0
Yes	One hundred ten minus five X	3.0
Then well can you say why you got a mathematical expression like this	Um	0.0
Um	The one labeled X is that one day after they finished their prayers and	3.0
Yes	And on that day since the smaller brothers amount of money is bigg oh was bigger than his big brother	4.0
And on that day since the smaller brothers amount of money is bigg oh was bigger than his big brother	well Ichiros so in short well Ich Ic who had 180 yen	4.0
well Ichiros so in short well Ich Ic who had 180 yen	Huh	0.0
Huh	Ichiro is one second in short in short the difference in the amounts of money on that one day	4.0
Yes	The fact is the smaller brothers amount of money is more than Ichiros and	3.0
Yes	And the person who had 110 yen is the amount of money the smaller brother had in the beginning	4.0
And the person who had 110 yen is the amount of money the smaller brother had in the beginning	So the smaller brothers is bigger and Kazu oh Ichiros is smaller	4.0
How much will this be	Fifty	3.0
Fifty	Fifty	1.0
In this X if we still put in 13 how much is this	Fortyfive	3.0
That means in this situation the values of the left side and the right side which is greater	The left side	3.0
That means can we say that putting in 13 for X holds true for this inequality	We cant say it	3.0
We cant say it	We cant say it	1.0
When you com compare them	Its greater	3.0
Numbers that are what than 14	Greater	3.0
But the answer that one day is it just the fifteenth day	From 15	3.0
Hm	Its from the fifteenth day up to the eightee eighteenth day	3.0
How about the nineteenth day	Its not included	3.0
Why	Since Ichiros wallet becomes empty and	4.0
Yes	at that time theyll end it	3.0
Now then since it would be poured rapidly the amount of juice increases like this right	Wow	0.0
Okay	Then Choshi	1.0
Okay	Yes	0.0
Yes	For Ichiro	0.0
Yes	to pour more than the smaller brothers	3.0
to pour more than the smaller brothers	the amount needed for that	3.0
Then did you understand that one just now	I dont understand	2.0
Then would you point with your finger	Huh	0.0
Where is it	In short here is 50 milliliters so	3.0
Yes	Lets have it so we need up to 80 milliliters and up to here	3.0
Yes	Up to here	3.0
Yes	That amount I think we should make X	3.0
In this situation	The increased amount	3.0
How about over here	Eighty	3.0
And which is more	Over here	3.0
Would you try saying it	Yes	0.0
Yes	Fifty plus X	3.0
Yes	bigger than	3.0
Which	bigger than	3.0
Okay	eighty	3.0
Go ahead	More than	3.0
Yes	Thirty	3.0
Concretely	Fifty	3.0
Then if we say one between these	Thirty point one	3.0
Thirty point one	Forty	1.0
Its thirty point one	Ahh	0.0
Anything else	Thirty	3.0
Thirty	Thirty point one	1.0
Thirty point	One one	3.0
Anything else	Forty	3.0
Forty	Thirty point one one one	1.0
But about how many are there	Infinite	3.0
Infinite	Infinite	1.0
Is thirty included or not included	Its included	3.0
Its included	Its not included	1.0
Then for now well end	Stand up	0.0
Stand up	Bow	0.0
Bow	Thank you very much	0.0
Okay	Teacher	0.0
Teacher	Do we copy everything from here	0.0
I want you to know that there are ways of thinking like this okay	All stand	0.0
All stand	Onegaishimasu	0.0
Onegaishimasu	Onegaishimasu	0.0
Date please interpret this	Multiply all with 10	3.0
How would you fix this	Number three and number nine	3.0
Number three and number nine	That problem is wrong	3.0
That problem is wrong	Teacher	0.0
Now its okay isnt it	Yes	0.0
Then how about this	Oh negative two X	3.0
Right	Huh	0.0
Huh	It changed a lot when it became negative two	3.0
So because this is here you can change the direction you know	You dont change it at the negative two part	3.0
You change the direction while you divide both sides with this denominator you know	I didnt change it like that	4.0
I didnt change it like that	Because this this changes it to negative two	4.0
Because this this changes it to negative two	Because you do it with this	4.0
Write it like this and	I was too lazy to write that at the bottom	0.0
X greater than or equal to seven sixths	Correct	0.0
People below four are stone	Arai has zero right	0.0
Fukuda can you see it	Yes	0.0
Can you see	I can see	0.0
Genji please read the problem	You would like to buy 10 cakes all together for less than 2100 yen	0.0
You would like to buy 10 cakes all together for less than 2100 yen	One type of cake is 230 yen each and the other cakes are 200 yen each	0.0
Which cake seems more delicious	The 230yen one	3.0
But the 230yen one looks more delicious so you want to buy as many as possible	Nine	3.0
But you only have 2100 yen so so in fact how many 230yen cakes can you buy	Nine	3.0
Think about how many you could buy and how to figure it out	Do we solve this problem	0.0
Go ahead	Can you bargain and lower the price	0.0
Oh dont you know it	Ah I did it	0.0
I told you not to use this but to use the back didnt I	Were buying 10	3.0
You need to buy 10 so please buy 10 okay	Buy 10	0.0
But if you buy 10 230yen cakes how much will it cost	Two thousand three hundred yen	3.0
I dont care what kind of method you use	Inequality equation	3.0
Okay go ahead	Is it not permissible to buy nine	0.0
Is it not permissible to buy nine	I dont get this	2.0
Can you	Then you exchange	0.0
How are you going to think about it	Its also okay if its over 10 right	3.0
Buy 10	Ten	0.0
Ten	Ten	0.0
Well then how can you find out how many you can buy	There are people whowould have them take the cake take a 200yen cake and break it in half and make it 100yen	3.0
Its different from asking to have half a Japanese radish you know	If you ask them to halve the Japanese radish theyd do it for you	0.0
Not by using equations or things like that but tell me what you have to do to get the answer	Buying two thousand two 2100 yen exactly	3.0
Buying two thousand two 2100 yen exactly	We dont need to its okay if we have change left over right	3.0
Well there is one minute of remaining time	I dont understand this	2.0
Oh there are no paper people	Whats paper	2.0
How did you think about it	What	0.0
Okay go ahead	I didnt understand it at all but	2.0
I didnt understand it at all but	First of all	0.0
First of all	I thought that I should calculate	4.0
I thought that I should calculate	How many of the 230yen ones I could buy and	4.0
How many of the 230yen ones I could buy and	In the beginning when I did it with 10	4.0
In the beginning when I did it with 10	It ended up being 2300 yen so	4.0
It ended up being 2300 yen so	Its not good because its over the amount so	4.0
Its not good because its over the amount so	And then next when I did it with nine	4.0
And then next when I did it with nine	When I did it with nine it was 2070 yen and it was okay but	4.0
When I did it with nine it was 2070 yen and it was okay but	you need to buy 10 so when I calculated it	4.0
you need to buy 10 so when I calculated it	to buy one 200yen cake	4.0
to buy one 200yen cake	Two 2070 plus	4.0
Two 2070 plus	Two hundred yen is	4.0
Two hundred yen is	With 2270 yen and	4.0
With 2270 yen and	You go over	4.0
Okay	So then you keep reducing the numbers and	3.0
Keep reducing and when you do it with eight on this side and two this side then	When I did it	0.0
When you did it	Time ran out and	0.0
Time ran out and	I couldnt do it to the end	0.0
Did you find it in a flash	The 230yen one	3.0
The 230yen one	You buy three of them and	3.0
Then how much does it become	Six hundred ninety yen	3.0
And what about this side	Seven	3.0
When you buy seven	Two thousand ninety yen	3.0
If you buy seven if you buy seven 200yen ones how much does it become	One thousand four hundred yen	3.0
How much is it if you add it	Two thousand and seventy yen	3.0
Two thousand	Oh	0.0
Oh	Two thousand ninety yen	3.0
What about yours Joji	Im not done yet	0.0
What	Im still doing it	0.0
Your method	Inequality equation	3.0
Okay what about Luikos	Inequality equation	3.0
How did you do yours Bancho	Huh	0.0
How did you do that	The same as that	1.0
Huh	Inequality equation	3.0
Then how much money is needed	Two thousand three	3.0
Can you make up the 210 yen	Seven	3.0
Then if you buy seven of the cakes that are 30 yen cheaper if you do that then what about this side	Three	3.0
Then how did you think about this one	The total 230 yen oh	4.0
The total 230 yen oh	Its for some amount and make that amount X and	4.0
Its for some amount and make that amount X and	You need to buy 10 of the 200yen ones	4.0
You need to buy 10 of the 200yen ones	So 10 make it 10 minus X and	4.0
So 10 make it 10 minus X and	And the total has some amount of two 230yen ones	4.0
And the total has some amount of two 230yen ones	And the 230yen ones are 230 X	4.0
And the 230yen ones are 230 X	And the 200yen one is 200	4.0
And the 200yen one is 200	bracket 10 minus X And then then 200 230 X plus 200 bracket 10 minus X	4.0
bracket 10 minus X And then then 200 230 X plus 200 bracket 10 minus X	is less than minus less than or equal to 2100 yen	4.0
is less than minus less than or equal to 2100 yen	And you form the inequality equation	4.0
What do you need to answer	How many 230 yen cakes you buy	3.0
If its six of this cake then how many of this cake do you need to buy	Four	3.0
What	Four	3.0
What	Because its not enough	3.0
Huh	Add	3.0
Then then how many is it here	X	3.0
Ryusaki how do you come up with four here	Subtract	3.0
Then if this is X then what is this	Ten minus X	3.0
Okay Sakai how much is it here when you take the parentheses off	Huh	0.0
Multiply this and this	Mm	0.0
Well then how do you do two bracket X plus three	Two X	3.0
Well then remove the brackets	I did it	0.0
I did it	I did it	0.0
I did it	Four plus five	3.0
Four plus five	You multiply it right	3.0
Bracket 200 times 10 is see	Two thousand	3.0
Two thousand minus you multiply this so this time on this side so okay	Two hundred X	3.0
Then which is the next one that you transpose	Two thousand	3.0
Itll become 10	Thirds	3.0
Which is easier doing it onebyone or using an inequality equation	An inequality equation	3.0
Its like this you know	Twelve times	3.0
Its not a 12 you know	I got it	0.0
I got it	Twenty	3.0
What about you Uchida	Huh	0.0
Huh	Two hundred	3.0
Look at the figure and set up an equation and work it out okay	What number	0.0
Number two	Number two	0.0
Okay Watabe	Uh wait a second	0.0
Okay go ahead	You dont understand if you dont look at anything	0.0
Its not written	This is going to appear in the equation	0.0
This is going to appear in the equation	Oh how much is it for the baskets	2.0
The basket price is	Eighty yen isnt it	3.0
Eighty yen	The total was 1000 yen wasnt it	3.0
Watabes is less than 2000 yen	Two thousand	0.0
Eight	Its wrong	0.0
Its wrong	What	0.0
What	What is this	0.0
What is this	What	0.0
This the answer of this inequality equation is wrong isnt it	Isnt it okay	0.0
Isnt it okay	Because this is 10 right	3.0
Because this is 10 right	Is this the answer	0.0
Is this the answer	With 80	3.0
Its this value here	Two times nine	3.0
Two times nine	What about eight	2.0
What about eight	Seven hundred fifty	3.0
Huh	The answer is	0.0
The answer is	What is the answer	2.0
What is the answer	Is it this	0.0
However this wont be the answer to the applied problem so	One hundred seventy over 20	3.0
Seventeen over two right	So teacher if you do it like this is it correct	0.0
Fifty times 15 is look	Not yet	0.0
Then it becomes 750	For example how do we write the answer	0.0
Its 70 times 20 so its not 140 but its only one zero right	Who can read this	0.0
Who can read this	Who cant read this	0.0
Didnt I teach this to you before	One hundred forty four	3.0
About it being exactly 2000 yen why did it become exactly 2000 yen here	Since its divisible	3.0
What	The basket price	3.0
Is it okay	Yes okay	0.0
Then Ill hand out the problems for number 10 and finish	From what number to what number are there	0.0
One two okay	Four more	0.0
Please get ready to bow	Stand	0.0
Stand	Thank you very much	0.0
Thank you very much	Thank you very much	0.0
But you did make it	No	0.0
Did you at least bring your books	Yes	0.0
Well Ill make a note of it	Theres a couple of assignments that I didnt get back yet	0.0
Which ones	The two of the additional exercises two B three and four	0.0
The two of the additional exercises two B three and four	I didnt even get to do any of the additional exercises Miss	0.0
I didnt even get to do any of the additional exercises Miss	Because I had a catchup test  I didnt have any time left to do this	0.0

You too Arnela	Eh	0.0
Did it work out	Well except for the last one	0.0
And then you may open up your books and notebooks	We may	0.0
Sorry	Is that for Wednesday	0.0
Is that for Wednesday	Yes	0.0
Twentythree	Im starting	0.0
Very cozy how you chose to sit in the back like that	That way I can see better	0.0
so Im curious to know whether you succeeded in making this type of equation alongside a graph	I succeeded	0.0
You succeeded	Yes	0.0
Succeeded	I didnt	0.0
Linda	No way	0.0
No way	Make my day	0.0
Marion did you succeed	Yes a little bit	0.0
A little bit	Not exactly	0.0
Succeeded	No	0.0
Um Simon what did you get	Uh	0.0
Uh	Nothing	0.0
What is your answer to question 23 A	Oh I dont have that one	0.0
Whats the equation	Twentythree	3.0
Peter	Y times zero point five plus one equals X	3.0
Y times zero point five	Plus one	3.0
times zero point five and then	Plus one	3.0
And then	Equals X	3.0
Sharone	Uh Y is three plus one times X	3.0
One plus	A half	3.0
A half	Times X	3.0
Okay Stefan	Y is a half times X plus one	3.0
Okay Mina	I have that	1.0
What do you notice about these last two equations	They are the same	3.0
They are the same	The other way around	1.0
Maarten	The Y is reversed	3.0
How can you see that in the diagram	The vertical line	3.0
Arnela would you like to try one	Um	0.0
Which of those four equations would you like to do	Lets do um A perhaps	0.0
Okay try to explain to me which one of these four lines belongs to that	Uh well personally I thought it might be one	3.0
Explain why	Well because it uh well I thought that those black lines crossed the vertical line at four	4.0
This line is a descending line can you also tell that from the equation	descending value	3.0
Yes	And the one the least was subtracted from thats the number one	3.0
Descending lines	Um A and D	3.0
Ricardo how can you see if an equation belongs with a descending line	It runs like this	3.0
But how can you tell that from the equation	If it has a little minus mark	3.0
Yes but where does the minus mark have to be	It has to be um it has to be um in front of the slope	3.0
Are you still able to see that or not	Not really	0.0
What is the starting number of A	Um four	3.0
What is the starting number of D	D	0.0
Um Arnold	Uh B is three and you add that	3.0
I dont see any zero here	No	0.0
What is the deal with that	Uh one	0.0
No but I would like to have a word with you shortly Charles	Thats fine	0.0
Maarten	You dont have to write the zero down	3.0
Um Casper why dont you name one	In scuba diving	3.0
Excuse me	In scuba diving	3.0
In The Netherlands or uh somewhere	In France	0.0
And you Ricardo	Well soon Im going to dive with my  at a diving beach	0.0
And what else did we come across	Cell phones	3.0
Then you have a starting number that is the starting amount that you pay for the subscription and how much per unit is added	The braking distance	3.0
Excuse me	The braking distance	3.0
Was that linear	No	0.0
Yes that was not a linear relationship	The skating	3.0
Yes we looked at that	Alcohol checks	3.0
That is for tomorrow	Can you pass me a sheet	0.0
And in case you didnt complete page 52 yet	Thats an awful lot	0.0
Thats an awful lot	Yes	0.0
Those are two pages yes	Yes	0.0
Who can I give the pleasure of an answer booklet	Yes	0.0
Uh tomorrow I will have a look at notebooks again by the way	By the way	0.0
If not then Ill have a neat surprise	Oh wed love a neat surprise	0.0
I thought that you were you were going to make an appointment with me yesterday	What	0.0
But you were gone at the end of class	A double appointment	0.0
Why dont you just remain seated for a moment at the end of class okay	Yes	0.0
And your notebook	Ive made all the assignments	0.0
So we can check it	Fiftytwo 53 54	0.0
Next time I want to check your notebook to see if everything is in there	Teacher may I	0.0
How far are you	At 26	0.0
Sorry	Twentysix	0.0
Then keep going with it	I am already at the additional exercises	0.0
Your homework is not in order	No I didnt understand it	0.0
Will it be done tomorrow	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes tomorrow it will be finished	0.0
Excellent so for now you better get on top of it	Teacher	0.0
Yes	I would love to have my grade of my math paper	0.0
And you are not sure yet either	I dont understand problem 25	2.0
Write down a linear equation in which you can calculate how much well	I dont understand that	2.0
What do you need for a linear equation	Oh uh the starting number and the slope	3.0
How do you find that in	Two hundred thats	3.0
Well you just had the letters the wrong way around	Yes	0.0
Which letter is the outcome	Uh Y	3.0
Uh what letter shall we pick for that	The amount of water or something	4.0
Well multiply it by one letter just one letter	H	0.0
H Okay H equals is a good way to start	H equals	0.0
The slope or uh the starting number always comes all the way at the end	Yes	0.0
So it is	Positive	3.0
So do you add it up or do you subtract it	Add it up	3.0
No this will be this will become one equation	Oh	0.0
Where do you have the other one	Yes it looks kind of sloppy	0.0
Yes that one you should write down a little more neatly because its difficult to reconstruct this way	Let me see X	0.0
That was zero point five times X simply X	Something like this	0.0
You already have H equals that is the same as this	H equals and then the slope	3.0
Now you still have to	Insert the slope	3.0
Correct	That is let me see that is minus that is minus one oh that is minus	3.0
How many steps do you have to go down then	Uh hang on also also 10	3.0
Where are we	At 100	3.0
At 100	At the hu like this at the 100 one four steps	3.0
Thats this point	Oh that point	0.0
Here it lies at the 10 and here it lies at the	One hundred twentyfive	3.0
That has gotten how many times smaller	Ten	3.0
Divided by 10	One hundred twentyfive divided by 10 is twelveandahalf	4.0
Okay and this is the vector number or the slope	Oh	0.0
Did you also have a question	Yes	0.0
Yes	I um I was sick yesterday so I dont have 12 through 19	0.0
And did it work out	Well no I still need to do that	0.0
Where exactly are you	Right now	0.0
Which problem did you complete	At 27	0.0
And this one you havent done	Right I skipped that one	0.0
That is impossible because then you dont understand those yet	Yes a little bit I do find it to be quite difficult	0.0
But at what problem did you end	At 12	0.0
And dont do the additional exercises for tomorrow instead you just go as far as time allows you to	Yes	0.0
Preferably more than two pages otherwise you will fall behind even more	Yes okay	0.0
I will make an appointment with you later because yes no I think that you are working badly	I already made that one	0.0
Well at least sit straight and get to work please	Teacher I have been checking the wrong chapter I thought	0.0
I want the both of you to write down a clarification for yourselves at problem 27	Okay	0.0
So that you explain to yourself why that line is there otherwise you will never find it back	Okay	0.0
Hm	Yes I know because I came to A has the starting number four	4.0
Yes I know because I came to A has the starting number four	And	0.0
That way you can see it very clearly	Yes because that ones lower that other one	4.0
Why dont you close problem 27 in your book and grab your notebook and write down the equations of these four lines	Equations	0.0
Uh huh	Okay um	0.0
Okay um	Y equals	3.0
Simon I also have a nice little assignment for you	Y equals four	3.0
Oh yes	But I am busy correcting	0.0
Here I have drawn Simon four lines here	Right	0.0
Would you like to give that a try	Sure	0.0
Yes maybe your neighbor would like to join as well	Yes he does	0.0
The green one is not very legible	Times three	3.0
Times three	You mean times minus three	1.0
You mean times minus three	No its minus three times	1.0
No its minus three times	Hello	0.0
Hello	Four minus three	1.0
Four minus three	No I know that	0.0
It is good practice	We dont really understand it	2.0
We dont really understand it	I think	0.0
Well	I understood it but now I dont understand it anymore	2.0
Take a line	Okay A	0.0
Okay A	A line one	0.0
What do you need to know before you can make an equation	The starting number and  number	3.0
Go ahead and see if you can find the starting number and the slope	I have four and minus three	3.0
I have four and minus three	But how can you place that in the equation	2.0
But how can you place that in the equation	Yes	0.0
How do you start your equation	Y	3.0
Well why dont you write that down	Thats what we have	0.0
Well great then lets see what you have	I have Y is four	3.0
Y is four and this I cant read	Yes	0.0
It shows a hyphen	Yes I had X times X or so	3.0
Minus three is	Yup I also have that	0.0
Yup I also have that	Minus three is	3.0
What comes after that	Is X	3.0
Is X	No but that is not possible	1.0
No because you started with Y equals	Yes	0.0
So youve already got equals	Oh okay	0.0
Y equals four X minus minus three	Minus three	0.0
Minus three	I have that too	0.0
Okay	And then what	2.0
Then do the red line	Oh is this one finished already	0.0
Oh is this one finished already	Yes is this	0.0
And then you are done	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay uh	0.0
Okay uh	Y equals	3.0
Y equals	Y equals five	1.0
Y equals five	Isnt it three	1.0
Isnt it three	Were going from line two	0.0
Come on	Y equals five	3.0
Y equals five	Um	0.0
Um	Times	3.0
Times	Five times X minus minus three	1.0
Five times X minus minus three	No that is not possible because since then youve got	1.0
No that is not possible because since then youve got	No minus one two yes though minus three	1.0
No minus one two yes though minus three	And then	2.0
And then	Teacher we got the second one too	0.0
What and what is it	Well I am not saying anything	0.0
Well I am not saying anything	I got it though	0.0
Yes	Y equals five times minus three X minus three	3.0
And now whats the starting number	Five	3.0
Okay what is the vector number the slope	Minus three	3.0
Okay you should always begin with	Uh Y equals five	3.0
Yes but why five	Well because that is the starting number	4.0
Youve also put it at the end over here	No because four is the starting number	4.0
Yes it is the wrong way around	But you just said that it was correct	0.0
No the the the starting number is always the independent variable that is written at the end	This is what I drew how I	0.0
Yes that four is added in every step	So then this is also this is also the wrong way around	0.0
So then this is also this is also the wrong way around	That la two	0.0
Yes it is the wrong way around	Oh and the last one too	0.0
And the last one	Y equals minus three	3.0
Right	Uh times	3.0
Uh times	Times five	1.0
Times five	No no no times X minus five	1.0
Why dont you begin by writing down Y equals	Y equals minus three	3.0
Y equals minus three	Doesnt it	0.0
Yes	X or no minus four four X four	3.0
But when its on the upper side than it is plus	Yes but you dont have to write the plus down	0.0
Write it down again write it down again	This number one	0.0
Yes	Y is	3.0
Yes	Minus three	3.0
Yes	X um minus four	3.0
It is located on the upper side	Oh no it is four four	3.0
And something has to be inserted	Yes but thats what I cant figure out	0.0
Is it a positive four or a negative four	Oh plus four	3.0
Oh plus four	X plus four	1.0
Yes	But in the book it is shown differently	0.0
This way is correct	Three X and I put this here	3.0
Correct	Okay	0.0
Is it working or not	Yes with the red one	0.0
Tell me about it	That is the	0.0
No	No because thats the slope	4.0
And then over here is the	Starting number	3.0
That goes over here	That has to be the other way around	3.0
It is a totally different equation	Yeah	0.0
Is it a positive five or a negative five	Uh negative	3.0
Lets see where is the diagram	Right there	0.0
Is it a positive or a negative number	A negative number because it goes down	4.0
I am talking only about this point	Positive	3.0
Now do the black one	Teacher you are not explaining it correctly because the book says something else	0.0
This is exactly the same thing as is shown over there except in a different sequence	Okay	0.0
Yes	So we should do it in this manner	0.0
That gives you some grip on it	Begin with the starting number	3.0
What	Do you have to start with the slope	0.0
So well put this one down that is also allowed we are going to put that at the end but look the slope multiplied by A	Yes and then what	2.0
but you did starting number times X	But	0.0
But	Oh yes thats at the end	3.0
Then you can help each other out every time	Or spy	0.0
For example yes	The slope	3.0
The slope	And then the starting number	3.0
Eh two four six seven	And then	2.0
And then	What do you mean And then	2.0
What do you mean And then	Starting number	3.0
Starting number	Yes	0.0
Yes	But didnt you always have to	0.0
Yes	I dont quite get four	2.0
The first way was	A table	3.0
How can you tell by looking at the table whether they are linear	When theyre all equal steps	3.0
And the other way we observed yesterday well we said to each other that we could also check which ones are not linear	No that is two	3.0
Do you remember that series we just wrote down	You have to square it	3.0
But if you say you find those tables easier because that way you dont have to memorize them that is just as well	With that with that letter thats not minus either	3.0
With that with that letter thats not minus either	is it	0.0
Very true that is not linear either very good	C is not linear either then	3.0
And the other two if you if you have a good look you can recognize it because you may see something that looks like a starting number and a slope	Hers is not correct of course	1.0
or you do it with a table and you say that each time equal amounts are added so therefore it is	Okay	0.0
Yes	Y is minus twoandahalf X minus twoandahalf X and the starting number is	2.0
Y equals so far so good	The starting number is four	3.0
From that what line did we have here	The black one	3.0
Very good and now the slope	I thought it was minus onethird	3.0
Yes	All right	0.0
Draw it with pencil and a triangular protractor	Teacher do I have to so far I have as starting number	0.0
How do you always find the starting number	Um where it where it intersects	3.0
What line does it have to cut and its not intersecting it is cutting	Oh the the	0.0
Yes yes	One the one	3.0
Very good yes	And then the slope is two	3.0
If you go one step to the right	Yes well arent you arent you supposed to go down like that	3.0
What should I do to end up on to the black line again	One half for example	3.0
So upwards is always positive yes	Madam	0.0
I will have a look at those tomorrow yes	All right all right	0.0
See you all tomorrow	See you tomorrow	0.0
You have to see how far youll get	A lot	0.0
A lot	Yes	0.0
Yes	I really dont understand it	0.0
I really dont understand it	Teacher arent we allowed to	0.0
Yes yes yes yes	I said just leave it	0.0
Ravi your punishment lines	Oh yes	0.0
As first thing before I forget again	that too	0.0
Okay	Wasnt that twice then	0.0
Wasnt that twice then	Twice we were supposed to didnt we	0.0
Twice we were supposed to didnt we	Oh	0.0
Which one of you ever heard of Pyth Pythagoras	Uh	0.0
Uncle Pete	Pete Pete Pete	0.0
Tell us what do you know about it	Its a gentleman	0.0
Its a gentleman	A squared plus B squared equals C squared	3.0
Who else can say more about it	Uh I think this guy was a Greek	0.0
The uh this gentleman was Greek	Yup	0.0
Does anyone know when you would use the Pythagoras theorem and what you would use it for	Yes in a diagram	3.0
We have different types of triangles	Rightangled	3.0
We have a rightangled triangle	Isosceles	3.0
What is a characteristic of a rightangled triangle	It has it has one	0.0
Ruben	It has a right angle	3.0
What other kinds of triangles do we have	An isosceles triangle	3.0
What is characteristic of an isosceles triangle	Two equal sides	3.0
Maarten	That A and B are equal	3.0
Which one	Equally shaped	3.0
An equilateral triangle	Oh	0.0
Julie	All sides are equal	3.0
Would there be anything else I can mention about an equilateral triangle	Um all angles are equal	3.0
And can we tell how wide they are	Yes 180 divided by three	3.0
One hundred eighty divided by three and that is	Sixty	3.0
Do we have any other rightangled side in there	Yes	0.0
But if you see this triangle what can we call that side	The long side	3.0
Or in a different way	The right side	3.0
Namely Maarten	The square root of 37	3.0
Rene	Well I think you have to up on top of the large square oh no thats something you dont know	3.0
Yes though	Yes then you have to uh remove those angles or uh yes well thats how you get the small square	3.0
How much	Uh nine centimeters squared	3.0
Willem	I dont know how you calculate it but I can just see it	2.0
What is the outcome according to you if you are just able to see it	Um four in total comes off because one of those uh	4.0
One of these triangles	That is one	3.0
Okay	And there are four of those	3.0
Leni	You make it into a rectangle	3.0
And then	We calculate the surface area	3.0
Namely that is	The square root of five	3.0
We may not even need Pythagoras at all	No	0.0
Well if I place them on top of one another they are indeed if I place them very neatly on top of each other equal in size	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Well	Approximately	3.0
They are really equal in size but they stick a bit	Yes	0.0
Convinced	Yes	0.0
Yes of course there are some who will never be convinced	I said yes	0.0
We will lay it down just like it is shown in the diagram in the book	Which question	2.0
Is one lying incorrectly	No	0.0
Those triangles those four triangles that are lying over here are equal in size as the triangles that are lying over there	Yes	0.0
What am I able to say about the surface of this square and that square	They are equally big as the other ones	3.0
then what is the surface area of the square that is attached to it	Twelve times 12	3.0
And that is	One hundred fortyfour	3.0
One hundred fortyfour	Without a calculator	0.0
Without a calculator	Oh yes	0.0
The short side that is five	Twentyfive	3.0
What do I know about the large square then	One hundred fortyfour plus 25	3.0
If I know that the surface area of the large square is 169 can I say something about how long this sloped side is	Which angle	2.0
Namely	Half of 12	3.0
Half of 12	Twelve	1.0
Twelve	The square root of 169	1.0
This one was 144 plus 25 is then 169	So the length is 13	3.0
But now we are going to construct very generally	Now I get it	0.0
Then you can always retrieve it	Yak	0.0
So we will write that down one rightangled side squared	Are you supposed to	0.0
Yup	You are supposed to copy that thing right	0.0
What I am writing down you have to copy	Oh	0.0
Oh	Ah	0.0
There	The table is slanted	0.0
By now you guys must know that I am crazy about diagrams and tables and things like that	Yes we knew that because you already told us yesterday	0.0
Well if you copy this Ravi itll speed up your homework for you will have done this assignment already	fast hey	0.0
And the squared value actually represents the surface area of the square that you placed on the sides	Yes	0.0
Yes	What	0.0
I need the one rightangled side I need the other rightangled side	Yes	0.0
Ladies would you please just be a little more quiet as well	They are filming in this chicken coop	0.0
Or in other words what is the surface area of the square that you attach to it Julie	Nine	3.0
That is nine	Julie	0.0
Am I	She is sick	0.0
And that gives you	Twentyfive	3.0
Twentyfive	Oh that is four times four and three times three and then subtract	4.0
Oh that is four times four and three times three and then subtract	Then the other one is five	1.0
And that leaves me with five	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I already knew that	0.0
Any questions about this	Yes but it is no	0.0
Regardless that you say yes but	Oh like that yes yes I got it	0.0
Myrte	But it says uh the other rightangled side equals the hypotenuse squared but do we have to take the square root of it instead of uh squaring it	3.0
The general equation therefore is uh Rick could you please go into the hallway now	Bye	0.0
Therefore if you want to know what the hypotenuse is then you have to take the root of the number representing the hypotenuse squared	Is it squared and then you have to yes okay	3.0
This whole table over here shows these numbers squared	Yes	0.0
Very well	You figured it out	0.0
And that is how most of your parents learned this	Oh	0.0
They just learned it kind of like this is how it is so you better get to work with it	A squared plus B squared equals	3.0
A squared plus B squared equals	Oh right	0.0
Okay	shows the thing squared there	3.0
The surface area of the square	Like that would help	0.0
Thats homework	Hey	0.0
Hey	You are being filmed	0.0
You are being filmed	They will just edit that out	0.0
They will just edit that out	Thats right	0.0
Thats right	Each time Ravis head will be cut out	0.0
Each time Ravis head will be cut out	Yes	0.0
You guys still have 20 minutes left	Twenty	0.0
Twenty	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Sorry Willem	The only thing	0.0
The only thing	Yes it is fine like that	0.0
Half of you are now missing this instruction	Oh oh sorry you have it right here	0.0
You girls are missing the instruction	Shh	0.0
Yes	Yes understood	0.0
From now on I really want it to be quiet when I am instructing	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
You are one of the few or one of the few together with a few more but there are several who want nothing but to pay attention	Yes	0.0
If you keep on disrupting then you are disrupting everyone	Yes	0.0
And certainly me	Yes	0.0
Just put it on uh	It doesnt make any sense you dont feel	0.0
Yes no dont close it completely just put it on I do want some oxygen to come in	Oxygen	0.0
Oxygen	The heater is still on	0.0
Otherwise I would be the first one to turn it off	Here two plus four plus six	4.0
Discussions are fine but please do it in a whispering voice	He has the bestlooking notebook in the whole class of course	0.0
He has the bestlooking notebook in the whole class of course	Beautiful notebook	0.0
Beautiful notebook	How can you determine how much of it is tiled	2.0
How does the whole diagram look the whole garden	As a square	3.0
Its an exact square	Yes	0.0
And what is the shape of that tiled part	A triangle	3.0
We just did that on the board on the other side	Yes I already have it	0.0
Ladies and gentlemen the fact that I have my back turned towards you doesnt mean you are allowed to turn things upside down	I agree	0.0
What can you make of this of that one triangle	A uh rectangle	3.0
What is the surface area then of that rectangle	Eight times six is 48	4.0
And what part of the triangle is it	I dont know	0.0
Considering you know that the whole rectangle because you said its six times eight	This one is 24	3.0
This one is 24	Twentyfour squares	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Maarten whisper	I dont know it anymore	0.0
Ladies should be whispering as well	I still dont understand G eight	2.0
We have a tiler who uses white as well as blue tiles	Yes	0.0
The white ones as well as the blue ones	Yes	0.0
Five tiles together make the square A B C D A B C D What is the surface area of that square	Um	0.0
Sorry	Twentyfive	3.0
You know that every tile the white one as well as the blue one is one square decimeter	Yes	0.0
Yes	Five	3.0
What is the length then of A B given the surface area of that square is five	The square root of five	3.0
Because if later on you you read it again you wont know how you get that square root of five	Yes	0.0
Now we have to fill in the length of A E A E goes from here to there	Is two times AB	3.0
But you dont have to do that here yet that will come later on	to write the two differently	0.0
You knew that the square root of 16 was equal to four	Yes	0.0
Yes	Oh uh it is equal to uh the square root of four	3.0
Look the two was correct but	Oh yes	0.0
Try to do the rest of them now too	Yes	0.0
Yes	Look I have a question since yesterday I had something from chapter one	2.0
Oh yes	And um look this is for example um the regular square	0.0
Yes	And that one is 40 square centimeters	4.0
And that one is 40 square centimeters	So the reduction goes to 10 square centimeters	4.0
So the reduction goes to 10 square centimeters	Then the factor isnt four is it	4.0
No	It is two isnt it	3.0
Correct because the surface area becomes four times smaller	Yes	0.0
But your magnifying factor will be the square root of that	So if you have for example a really large number for instance uh well yes I dont know uh for example with five numbers	3.0
Yes	And uh it becomes a lot smaller you have to divide it by four	4.0
And uh it becomes a lot smaller you have to divide it by four	So uh the magnifying factor with reduction has to be divided by four whereas if you make it from small to large it is times four	4.0
So uh the magnifying factor with reduction has to be divided by four whereas if you make it from small to large it is times four	Okay	0.0
You were first	I just have a question	2.0
Yes	Uh could it also be that you only get this number	3.0
Yes	So this one and that one and then all you have to do is calculate this one here	3.0
Very good	Okay	0.0
Great	Where is this key on my pocket calculator	0.0
Where is this key on my pocket calculator	Oh it is fine right	0.0
And this is your root	So its the same thing	3.0
This is your root	Okay	0.0
Okay	Yes	0.0
Was it clear for you guys	Yes	0.0
You keep track of this a little too I hope	Yes yes I just wrote it down	0.0
Oh okay	Thats just the nature of the assignment	0.0
Is this one clear to you guys	Yeah sure	0.0
Really	Yes with the explanation earlier it made it in any case clearer	0.0
Yes with the explanation earlier it made it in any case clearer	But in the beginning it seemed a bit weird but now I understand it	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes okay	0.0
Yes okay	The same problem	0.0
But it is allowed youll still work through it	And uh the square root of	3.0
And uh the square root of	The square root of six	3.0
The square root of six	Yes	0.0
But if you want to calculate that one what do you need then	Then I can just this one like that	0.0
Then I can just this one like that	And uh	0.0
But since I have already explained it and as you understand it then as far as I am concerned you can go ahead and use it	Yes	0.0
Yes	If you want to measure this side	0.0
Yes	Then you have to this is 225	3.0
Yes	And this is 64	3.0
Yes	Then arent you supposed to take two 225 plus 64	3.0
Yes	Is 289	3.0
Yes indeed that square	That you have to make into a square root	3.0
Yes very good	So that becomes 17 then	3.0
So that becomes 17 then	And that is 17	3.0
Not only uh writing down the answers	Oh	0.0
Oh	Ehm look here	0.0
Ehm look here	Can you see it	0.0
Yes I can see it	One hundred ninetysix square meters	3.0
What exercise are you working on	Oh with um three	0.0
And what is this 196	That is the whole garden	3.0
Yes	Then I have to do minus	3.0
Yes	Twentyfour square meters	3.0
Yes	But doesnt that just become can you just take this off then like like in the same way if there wasnt a square meter on here	3.0
Yes because the whole garden is in square meters	I must be confusing it with something else then	3.0
So you can easily subtract square meters from square meters	Now I dont understand any of this anymore	2.0
That is the same thing you will do with the garden	Yes fine	0.0
Okay	This is how it should be done	0.0
This is how it should be done	Like this	0.0
Perfect very nice	Of course not are you crazy or something	0.0
Of course not are you crazy or something	But you were too warm werent you	0.0
But you were too warm werent you	Yes right I will just go and sit here without my Tshirt in my bare chest	0.0
I mean uh	Then itll get even colder	0.0
Are you cold	Yes	0.0
Yes	Very badly	0.0
Very badly	only wearing this really thin thing	0.0
You arent going to infect your sister are you	No she is she is already sick	0.0
She is at home though	Yes	0.0
And have you changed her yet or are you going to leave that to	Because I did that by myself	0.0
Yes	I am allowed to carry her into the church for the baptism	0.0
Oh you dont like that	Well I do think it is kind of neat and all	0.0
Well I do think it is kind of neat and all	Yes	0.0
Yes	Wow	0.0
Wow	Well wonderful	0.0
Well wonderful	Really uh great	0.0
Really uh great	No I think it is kind of neat	0.0
Yes	Do you have the answer booklets	0.0
Yes	Shirley isnt here and uh	0.0
Sixty	A B	0.0
And who normally sits next to	Sander	0.0
Oh yes	Four times the square root of 20 is eh	3.0
And Maarten	We just have to calculate this one so we have to take half	3.0
We just have to calculate this one so we have to take half	And then	2.0
And then	Well then	0.0
Will you indicate how you got the numbers	Oh yes I will	0.0
Ill need it again in a minute	Sixtyfour	3.0
Sixtyfour	And then this you have to add together	3.0
No	Which makes 89	3.0
No they have been here on Tuesday and now	What class was that then	0.0
On Tuesday it was A 2 C	With Dennis	0.0
Yes	Teacher	0.0
Yes	Can you check exercise three for a moment	0.0
Of course	Because if I have that one correct then	0.0
Then you understand it you mean	Yes because I am not sure if I understand it	0.0
But if you understand it then it doesnt matter at all	No I took the old method I think	3.0
No I took the old method I think	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	That is the new one	3.0
Yes that one wont be explained until the next paragraph	Oh so according to the book I am actually working ahead	0.0
All right	Here it says how big is the  and here Ive got five but do you just have to	3.0
Because the surface area of the square is five	Yes	0.0
So the side that is just one side	Yes	0.0
Is the root of this	Oh yes	0.0
Sorry	This square over here has four points	3.0
You may draw it	draw it	0.0
But you dont have to	I got it right	0.0
But what why	How does one calculate this	2.0
How much is what what is the surface area again of one of these angles	Twenty	3.0
No the surface area	Five	3.0
And how many of those little squares do I have in here	Four	3.0
Yes so	Twenty	3.0
Twenty	Yes but I thought	0.0
Because they are determining how you can write things in a different way	Okay	0.0
Yes	Yes okay	0.0
Yes okay	Heinjan and I are going to BEVO shortly	0.0
Yes fine	We have a test to take	0.0
Yes	Hey hey Ravi you still have to uh take the test as well	0.0
Hey hey Ravi you still have to uh take the test as well	May I come along with you	0.0
May I come along with you	Then you have to come right now	0.0
Then you have to come right now	Never mind Ill go I also have to go to BEVO	0.0
Well go ahead then	Where is	0.0
Just to the restroom	In the rectangle one diagonal	3.0
In the rectangle one diagonal	It is explained over here	0.0
Well that is explained with the surfaces	Yes	0.0
How that works	Oh that is right here	0.0
Yes	Oh with the surface area	0.0
And then over here it is explained again and then you can continue on working	Plus five is 17 no	3.0
Plus five is 17 no	It is 14	1.0
It was uh chapter one wasnt it	Yes	0.0
Yes	Sorry that one is wrong	3.0
Sorry that one is wrong	This is also wrong	3.0
This is also wrong	No its not	1.0
No its not	Yes it is	1.0
Yes it is	Dont make me cry	0.0
Is it that bad	Check your answer by measuring this in your diagram	3.0
Check your answer by measuring this in your diagram	The numbers on your triangle have completely faded	0.0
Yes	do wrong	0.0
Excuse me	I dont see why this is wrong here	2.0
What is done wrong here	Look it  is wrong but how are you supposed to know	2.0
Why dont you make a diagram of that triangle	One like that	0.0
Yes	Oh here	0.0
Yes	Is it if you uh write it down like this because you have to measure the other rightangled side	4.0
Yes	Then is this uh correct then because uh	3.0
Like do I need 41 or do I need 40 or do I need nine	Yes	0.0
Forty	Yup	0.0
So you still have to give an answer because otherwise I will have to search in such a diagram	Yup	0.0
And you know that I will always find the wrong one	But I looked in the answer booklet and it was wrong	3.0
Was the answer booklet wrong or were you wrong	I was wrong	3.0
I was wrong	Sir I dont understand any of this chapter	2.0
Sir I dont understand any of this chapter	But you told me it was correct	0.0
Thats nice	Yes	0.0
That gives me something to do	When is little Pete coming	0.0
Hell be coming up shortly	I am at 28 but theres a few things I dont understand	0.0
I think so	Sir	0.0
Who isnt coming	Laura	0.0
Why not	Well shes at a funeral	0.0
Hm	Sir what is this	0.0
Sir what is this	For photo or video	0.0
Its called video	Sir I forgot my folder	0.0
Do you have any loose sheets of paper	Yes I have those in my backpack	0.0
And your book	That I do have	0.0
Do you still remember where you had difficulties	Uh no	0.0
But it doesnt make any difference otherwise just pretend its not here	Why is it here	0.0
Okay	What is it for sir	0.0
Uh to shoot a film	To shoot a film	0.0
Youre still going to uh youre still going to uh do Pythagoras	What	2.0
Are you still going to do Pythagoras or chapter five	Oh Ill do uh	0.0
I would prefer that	Yes okay	0.0
What did you say	Can I fetch my books for a second	0.0
You guys have class	Yes	0.0
Where do you guys have class	Uh we dont know	0.0
Uh we dont know	Your mother came	0.0
Those cases from one A or one D whatever it is	Sir you really have to explain this	2.0
Yes I know	How are we supposed to do that	2.0
How are we supposed to do that	I dont understand a thing	2.0
I dont understand a thing	I am at three	0.0
I am at three	I didnt understand it at all	2.0
I didnt understand it at all	Ha	0.0
Ha	Excuses	0.0
Excuses	Yes excuses	0.0
Yes excuses	There are more of us who dont understand it	0.0
There are more of us who dont understand it	This is it I think	0.0
This is it I think	No I dont understand it	2.0
Very well	I  understand it	0.0
I  understand it	Really	0.0
Yes all right	add it up because I dont really understand it	3.0
You	I didnt bring my notebook	0.0
Can you get some paper	Can I get some paper	0.0
Do you know where you were	Yes at 16	0.0
Yes	Yes I dont understand assignment 15	2.0
Assignment 15	I dont have my notebook with me either	0.0
I dont have my notebook with me either	I have a piece of paper for you	0.0
This is going great you guys	Yes	0.0
Will you make sure to put it in your notebook	Yes	0.0
I will come by several people and then I will uh for everybody	Hes copying it	0.0
And yes right now you are calculating variables arent you	Thats right	0.0
So for example with three E is three E plus seven E	Yes if you add that then the outcome is	3.0
How many how many Es do you have	Ten E altogether	3.0
Ten E altogether	That is ten E squared	3.0
No why squared	Yes because you have two Es	4.0
How much are three Es plus seven Es	Ten Es	3.0
Only if youd multiply it then itll get an E squared	Oh	0.0
Two times three is	Two times three is six	4.0
And E times E that is the E squared	Yes but still here	0.0
Yes but you dont seem to have any E squared whatsoever	No but here	0.0
Yes	No but if this here is you have to take the same ones	4.0
No but if this here is you have to take the same ones	I multiplied all of them but I still ended up with the same thing	4.0
I multiplied all of them but I still ended up with the same thing	Just 11 P	4.0
Uh	But you are not allowed to multiply those with each other as stated somewhere over here look	4.0
But you are not allowed to multiply those with each other as stated somewhere over here look	Two different letters you cannot uh	4.0
No that is correct	Yes	0.0
So in this equation you have to fill in P equals one	Yes	0.0
What is the solution to this	Eleven times one	3.0
Eleven times one	Eleven	3.0
And what is the solution to this	Also 11	3.0
Is it possible that they could be the same	Yes	0.0
So I will fill in P equals six	Is 66	3.0
And over here	Sixtysix	3.0
Three times six is	Three times six is uh 18	4.0
Three times six is uh 18	Six times eight is 48 oh no that is not correct	4.0
Twentysix	Yes	0.0
Well that is something completely different	Oh	0.0
Oh	No	0.0
Because P equals 10	Well 110 and 80 plus 30 that one does work out fine	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
What is three times 10	I have that one three times 10	4.0
I have that one three times 10	Thirty	4.0
And eight plus 30	Eight plus 30 is 38	4.0
Eight plus 30 is 38	I need to multiply eight by 10 as well dont I	4.0
I need to multiply eight by 10 as well dont I	Oh no	3.0
Oh no	Now Im lost	0.0
Whats eight times what is eight plus 30	Eight plus 30	4.0
Eight plus 30	Thirtyeight	4.0
And 11 times 10 is 110	Oh like that	0.0
For P you just fill in 10 not 11 P times 10	Oh	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
You have to fill in something at this spot	Yes	0.0
That is what it is about	make over again	0.0
Which one	Do I have to make some calculations or uh resolve this I mean	0.0
Do I have to make some calculations or uh resolve this I mean	Or do I just have to	0.0
How much are six As plus five As	Eleven As	3.0
And two B plus three C can you add anything up here	No it just remains as it is	3.0
Where are you at	I am now at H because it is uh how are you supposed to its not possible because there is no E written at the end	4.0
Not over here but in the other one there is	There is I see	0.0
There is I see	So this is six	3.0
Uh huh	So what are you supposed to do with that	2.0
So what are you supposed to do with that	Do you just have to	2.0
How many Fs do you have here	Huh	2.0
How many Fs do you have here	Three	3.0
And here	One uh three	3.0
So whats the total	Nine	3.0
Three Fs plus three Fs is	Six	3.0
Six	Eleven Fs	3.0
Eleven Fs	Oh no here it says minus	3.0
Over here is I mean behind them here is an F here and there	Yes	0.0
Over here we have three and over here we have three as well so that is six minus five equals one F	So one F is clear	3.0
So one F is clear	And then one F minus three	3.0
F minus three	Okay	0.0
Can you move along	Yes	0.0
With that table	This one	0.0
This one	If I am correct it should be correct	0.0
Well yes if you are correct then it should be correct thats	Yes okay but	0.0
But do you understand what you are doing	Yes	0.0
And you are not caught up so you better continue working	Yes	0.0
Or are you at uh five	But I dont understand	2.0
Which one dont you understand	Problem D	0.0
Problem D	Twelve Y minus Y is that 12 or is it	2.0
How many Ys do you have	It is minus Y isnt it 11 Y	3.0
How many Ys did you get over here	One	3.0
The first section	Twelve	3.0
Give me a break and keep working please	Twelve	3.0
One Y	Yes or two	3.0
No because it says minus Y here so that means minus one Y	Oh	0.0
So 12 minus one equals 11 so you have 11 Ys	How are you supposed to know that because Y could also be two	2.0
That is something else because then you will fill in a number for Y	Yes	0.0
How many Ys do you have here	One	3.0
No	Twelve	3.0
How many do you take away	One	3.0
So how many will you have left	Eleven	3.0
It is not exactly uh what number the Y is because its only afterwards that youll fill something in for Y	Yes but if you start filling in something for Y then it doesnt make sense any more	4.0
Suppose for example you fill in three for Y	Thirtysix	3.0
Minus	Three thats	3.0
Do you understand it	Yes	0.0
Very well	Teacher	0.0
Are the diagrams coming along	This one	0.0
Yes	Yes somewhat	0.0
Yes somewhat	But we still had a question about eight	2.0
But we still had a question about eight	One that we already asked you last week	2.0
Uh huh	And were still clueless	2.0
Which eight	This one	0.0
Did you make a drawing of this	Yes	0.0
Can you show me	But I  because I copied this	0.0
Thats no big deal	Yes it is	0.0
Um what is the surface area of the top part	Fifty centimeters	3.0
Here you have the 50 and there the 15	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	You have to do 50 times 15	3.0
How long is this section	Um 750 centimeters	3.0
No that is the surface area	Well um	0.0
What is the length of this here	Fifty centimeters	3.0
What is the height of this	Fifteen	3.0
Of this whole area	Oh yes	0.0
You do 50 times H length times width	Yes	0.0
Which is 50 times the H Yes	Yes	0.0
Fifty times 15 and 50 times H	So the surface area is 50 times H	0.0
Plus 750	Okay	0.0
Are you able to sniff your way through it	Huh	2.0
Or are you doing okay	Oh oh yes it is not too bad	0.0
Oh oh yes it is not too bad	Sir question 18 B	0.0
Sir question 18 B	Yes I was just entertaining myself	0.0
What is this all about	I had time to finish my homework and	0.0
But what is it	To see if I have too much homework	0.0
To see if I have too much homework	But that is not what you asked	0.0
But that is not what you asked	Look this is question 18 E You have to take similar terms together	0.0
Yes what did you get in uh the first part	Huh	2.0
Huh	Here	3.0
Here	This one here	3.0
This one here	First you have to calculate this	3.0
Yes	Then this I already did that	0.0
Then this I already did that	Seventy times 50 equals 3500	4.0
Seventy times 50 equals 3500	Then 60 times 120 equals 7200	4.0
Yes	And then divide	3.0
And then here you have something written here	Yes	0.0
Uh	That is something like uh then you had to write this one no write it without brackets this one	3.0
Right	And then this one is 3500 plus 120 and then say 20 times 60 and 120 time B say	3.0
Exactly so uh	And one 120 times 60 is 7200	4.0
And you have 120 times minus B	Yes	0.0
How much is 120 times minus B	Minus B Yes or uh	3.0
One hundred twenty minus 120 B	Yes and do you have to write that down here as well	0.0
Whereas here you write 120	Over here 20	3.0
Over here 20	One hundred twenty	3.0
No what is this 120 about	That relates to uh this 3500 plus 120	3.0
Sixty times 120	Is 500 plus 7200 and then minus 120 B	4.0
So the B has to be taken away over here	Plus or times	2.0
Minus	Yes but	0.0
Yes	Yes okay	0.0
Fifteen didnt work	Huh	2.0
Huh	No it did work	3.0
No it did work	I just didnt come around to it yet	0.0
I just didnt come around to it yet	I still had a question about this	2.0
I still had a question about this	Ill make it in a second	0.0
Okay yes	Are you actually wearing a microphone	0.0
Yes	Could you step over here oops I dont understand half of this	2.0
Could you step over here oops I dont understand half of this	I understand A though	0.0
I understand A though	Yes I dont know	0.0
Take a moment to draw it	This	0.0
Just uh the no youve got it already its already here the multiplication table	Yes but I had	0.0
Or how much is three times two D	Six D	3.0
Yes and you can fill in the second one as well	Sir at 20 you just have to add uh	3.0
With	At 20 dont you simply have to do uh minus 50 minus 1540	3.0
Yes	Kind of a dumb question really	0.0
Is it coming along	I dont understand 15	0.0
Can you write them down more briefly	Yes	0.0
Can you do that	Yes	0.0
Yes	I am tired	0.0
That is possible	Why wouldnt it be possible	2.0
Did you succeed with 15	Uh no	0.0
You also dont have a notebook with you	No	0.0
And then in a minute you will also did you succeed with 15	No we didnt do	0.0
Did 15 work out	I didnt do that one	0.0
Okay	I dont understand this at all	2.0
I dont understand this at all	Is uh yes	0.0
Just uh yes	the circumference of	3.0
One of these sides this one is H	Yes	0.0
That is the surface area of this small section length times width is five times that H Five H The surface area of this whole square how long is this section	Five	3.0
And this	Five	3.0
So what is the surface area	Five squared	3.0
Right	Yes but isnt all of this part of it as well	3.0
And you have four times five times the H Four sections of five multiplied by H	Yes	0.0
That is the surface area and the circumference is H plus H plus five plus H plus H plus five	So do I need to add them all up	0.0
Yes	Yes but I dont understand the circumference uh the surface area do you have to this must be uh five squared	2.0
Yes	And then afterwards you still have to write down five um times five five times H	3.0
Plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H plus five times H	Or can I do four times H as well	3.0
Four multiplied by five times H	Oh right	0.0
And this is five H	Yes	0.0
And then you have these four pieces of five H	Twenty H	4.0
Twenty H	Then it becomes four times H Four times five times H	4.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	Twenty H	3.0
Twenty H	Sir I dont understand it	2.0
Sir I dont understand it	How are you supposed to do this then	2.0
How are you supposed to do this then	For example Q is two B	2.0
Plus three C can you do anything with that	Yes I think I dont know	0.0
I cant do anything with it	No	0.0
So can you do anything with it	No	0.0
Exactly	This will remain the same then	3.0
This will remain the same then	Then at C What are you supposed to do here	2.0
Then at C What are you supposed to do here	Only minus	2.0
Yes	So you do eight G minus six G	3.0
Yes	Uh what do you call those things	2.0
Uh what do you call those things	Is there a two G	2.0
Sure	Oh well that is an easy one	0.0
I will have to look and see how many reservations I have	Yes we too	0.0
Otherwise I will get in an argument with class two B because they all want to reserve as well	Yes but we are not two B	0.0
Yes but that is my mentor class	Yes but you cannot play favorites	0.0
No you are not allowed to play favorites but Im doing it anyway	Well that is not allowed	0.0
Well that is not allowed	Well sir that is your problem not ours	0.0
Um what are you supposed to do	I dont know	0.0
Yes	Draw an axis system	3.0
Draw an axis system	The ones of A B and C	3.0
From how far to how far does that axis system need to run	The Xaxis has to go from minus six to eight	3.0
Very well the Yaxis do you know anything about that	No	0.0
Just imagine something	Um a line like this and a line like that	3.0
Marjolein	The lines in there	3.0
Erik	I dont know	0.0
You dont know	By calculating those equations	3.0
Erik	The ones that are shown in the graph uh uh the equations	3.0
What numbers are you going to fill in for the X	Uh I dont know	0.0
Uh I dont know	How are you supposed to know that yet	2.0
Go ahead and pick a number	One	0.0
I will fill in one for the X	Um that will be um one plus four equals five	4.0
Um that will be um one plus four equals five	And then times three	4.0
Exactly	Is 15	3.0
Marjolein	Three	3.0
What is the outcome then	Seven	3.0
Three plus four is indeed seven and then	Twentyone	3.0
Minus six plus four is	Minus two	3.0
Three times minus two	That is minus six	3.0
And I will also just fill in eight	Thirtysix	3.0
Why would I choose minus six and eight	They are uh	0.0
They are uh	Minus six is at the beginning and eight at the end	3.0
What is the outcome at eight	Thirtysix	3.0
Yuck disgusting	No no that ones right as well	0.0
Is that a pencil or a pen	Pencil	0.0
Pencil	And a pen	0.0
And a pen	I dont have a triangular protractor	0.0
Yes but you can borrow one	No	0.0
You dont either	Yes I do have one but it is at home	0.0
Yes I do have one but it is at home	Yes I dont have I dont have a uh a triangle but I do have a triangular protractor	0.0
Yes	No you have to look this one you have to	0.0
Were you able to follow this at 15	Well	0.0
You continued okay	I really dont understand how you do it	2.0
What is that	No three	3.0
Twelve plus three is	Fifteen	3.0
So once you fill in a one for the X well just put a one here somewhere what does that do for the Y	Is that times three	0.0
Tell me what number you want to fill in	Three	3.0
You replace the X by a three and then what does it say	Three times three is nine	4.0
Exactly	Plus 12	3.0
Is	Twentyone	3.0
Well	That is exactly like the previous one	3.0
Yes	But then different	3.0
Try to fill in another number	Um three times eight equals	3.0
Twentyfour	So then its	0.0
What do you think the outcome will be	Minus six I think	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Plus 12	Equals minus six	3.0
Is it possible that the A and the C are the same	Yes because um	0.0
Yes because um	No because uh	1.0
Steffi is it possible	It has to be	3.0
Three times this four that becomes 12	And three	3.0
Times	Times	0.0
Times	Uh no here youve got three times that X and uh	3.0
Exactly	Tahdah	0.0
Precisely those equations are exactly the same	Do we need to draw it once again	0.0
So you can add A plus C Yes	Yes	0.0
Do you understand why these two are the same	Well no	0.0
Those multiplications signs mixing with those Xs	Yes but uh werent Xs always written like this and multiplication signs like that	3.0
So the equations of A and C are exactly the same	Oh right	0.0
But until youre there youll utilize the multiplication table	Okay	0.0
Yes	So did I also answer B since these are the same	4.0
Yes what particularity do you notice	Well that the A and the C are the same	4.0
Very good	Tahdah	0.0
Yes	Is it true that A and C are the same	0.0
Yes certainly it is correct	Sir thats the first sentence of	0.0
You guys have French class later on	Yes we do	0.0
Test or paper	A test	0.0
A test	But its really	0.0

Oh	Yes sir	0.0
Because next week we will continue with chapter six	Is the additional subject matter tough	0.0
Which makes this week the last opportunity to ask questions about chapter five	Yes	0.0
Yes	But sir what about the additional subject matter	0.0
Everything on chapter five	The test when is that	0.0
The test isnt until the exam week	Ooh	0.0
Ooh	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Sir are the additional assignments due tomorrow	0.0
What	Sir	0.0
Yes	Are the additional assignments due tomorrow as well	0.0
We will still continue anyway but thats not the intent	Yes	0.0
Yes	We dont have a test	0.0
We dont have a test	Sir	0.0
Do cut the French now	Okay	0.0
Okay	But sir  last five minutes	0.0
Last three minutes	Yes but	0.0
Yes but	But sir arent we off then sir	0.0
Do you really think that you can learn something all of a sudden in the last five minutes	Of course	0.0
Then you might as well do it in the last three minutes	Could you be so kind as to check if	0.0
Oh uh for Dalton in a moment	Tomorrow we dont have math and Friday is our last day	0.0
No then it is Friday	A de is not possible I think	0.0
A de is not possible I think	No that is not possible	0.0
Whatever you want	No that becomes au	0.0
Uh who else	Louise and I sir	0.0
Louise	Yes	0.0
Ah Harley is sick again	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	We have two quizzes coming up	0.0
We have two quizzes coming up	I have four things dude	0.0
Yes very difficult	German is what we have then	0.0
I have a very special one for you three times more difficult	Can I join the class of Harley in that case	0.0
Hey I want you to finally start doing something now	Huh	0.0
Huh	I am hurrying I am busy	0.0
You are very busy	That is three times X isnt it	3.0
Hey just get to work	Sir I dont understand 18	2.0
Sir I dont understand 18	I am calculating it the other way around	3.0
I am calculating it the other way around	If I have to calculate a surface area look 45 meters is five meters times eight meters	4.0
I think that uh 40 is five times eight or 45 is five times nine	Oh right	0.0
But its fine	Im not very good at doing it by heart	0.0
Uh it is fine that you do it the other way around	Yes because otherwise I cant calculate it too well	0.0
And now you do	Now lets have a look	0.0
Now lets have a look	This is exactly a square so that is nine times nine	4.0
Iris	I cant figure out 18 with that uh Ruben and the orchard and all that	2.0
What is the surface area of that	Um 350 no 3500	3.0
How do you calculate a surface area to begin with	Um	0.0
Just real simple	Ruben Ruben	0.0
Yes I know but you are the one who is picking it up	Length times width	3.0
What is the length here	Sixty	3.0
Sixty	Yes	0.0
Yes	Oh no wait 120	3.0
What is the width	Uh 16	3.0
Do you need to include the B or not	Yes no	0.0
So you have to take 60 and what are you supposed to subtract from that	Twenty	3.0
The last part you have to put in between brackets	Sixty minus B in between brackets	3.0
Even better exactly	Yes	0.0
Is that possible	Yes I dont know	0.0
Have a look uh at the equations	Yes	0.0
Could they be identical	Over here uh it is uh four by minus 12	3.0
Yes but over here it has three times in front of it	Yes but over here it has three times behind it	3.0
Three times the X is	Three X	3.0
Three times the four is	Twelve	3.0
It could be the same right	Yes of course	0.0
So what do you notice and what is the answer for B	That its identical	3.0
Are you going to show me on Friday that you have completed up to paragraph five	I will	0.0
Usually on Fridays I have some happy hours left since on Fridays Im sitting here until 11 oclock in the evening anyway	Oh yes then it is party time	0.0
Are you joining us as well	No	0.0
Why not	Yes I dont know	0.0
I wish you would	Oh no I have a match for school for soccer	0.0
Well just make sure you are there	Yes well I I dont know	0.0
I said make sure you are there	Fine then	0.0
Yes of course	Me too	0.0
Yes you bet	Five more minutes to go	0.0
Five more minutes to go	Sir may we study a bit	0.0
Sir may we study a bit	Sir	0.0
Yes	Here it says that Robin has a width of 50 centimeters	3.0
Here it says that Robin has a width of 50 centimeters	That is the length isnt it	3.0
Yes but that depends on how you look at length and width	Yes but this is the width isnt it	3.0
Yes but this is the width isnt it	From the top to the bottom	3.0
Does it matter what you take as the width or the length	Yes sometimes I think it does	3.0
Three times four is the same as four times three	Yes	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
So if they mean something different when they talk about length and width here	No but look over here	0.0
Yes	Over here is uh suppose that this is the width	0.0
Yes	Then that is H centimeters then you need to do 50 but if youd turn it around would it still stay the same	4.0
Then that is H centimeters then you need to do 50 but if youd turn it around would it still stay the same	Oh I see	0.0
Three times four and four times three is the same	Yes but that is not an H	3.0
Yes but hey four times three and three times four is the same as well isnt it	Yes thats true	3.0
Well there	Okay	0.0
Laurie try to keep working just a wee bit longer	We were allowed to study werent we	0.0
Have the last three minutes started yet	Yes	0.0
Yes	They did for me	0.0
Look how fast the French books are appearing on the tables now	Sir can I ask you one more thing	0.0
Yes	This one	0.0
This one	What is	0.0
And how much is three times four	Oh right 120	3.0
Three D plus 120	And the aux the AU and X thats what you get with A and plural	0.0
This is how you use the table	Oh	0.0
That you are kind of blushing	Me	0.0
Me	I always have that	0.0
I always have that	No but he said something and then I went like that and then he went like It was kind of funny	0.0
Good morning um	Yes I have I note	0.0
A note	Yes	0.0
Do you have it with you	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Where are you coming from	I went to the doctor	0.0
Where did the braids go	I had such a bad headache	0.0
Test	Yes I completed some problems but I should think I can get at least a seven and a half	0.0
What should we bet for	Well the fact that Im doing that test	0.0
Uh Laurie who else is absent over there	Loes	0.0
Right Loes	Uh jai mal a la	0.0
Why	Laura	0.0
What is the date today the 11th	Hey lair isnt that looks like	0.0
Hey lair isnt that looks like	As in you look sporty	0.0
Well good luck with uh French	Thanks	0.0
See you soon	Next week	0.0
Next week	What kind of guy is that	0.0
You guys are so late	for the camera	0.0
You wanted to step into the picture very explicitly	Sir	0.0
And homework according to the study calendar was the last the last part of the basic materials	Sir	0.0
Bram	I uh brought the wrong notebook with me	0.0
I wanted you to demonstrate later how you do those types of exercises	No	0.0
No	But I do have	0.0
Marian what is it	I dont understand 31	2.0
Can you guys calm down a bit here	Yes but  isnt here yet	0.0
Keep that bunch quiet over there	Okay Ill keep those little ones quiet	0.0
Which assignment	Thirtyseven	2.0
The very last one	Yes	0.0
The very last one Ill keep that in mind	Twentyeight C	2.0
You are very late with that arent you	Yes	0.0
Why dont you take care of that during a Dalton hour	Thirtysix	2.0
The last two assignments Sam help me out here	Thirtysix	2.0
What is it	Didnt I have to stay behind now	0.0
How can you get this equa multiplication to resolve	The four X uh squared two divided by X  four	3.0
X times four X is that four X squared or not	Yes	0.0
X times what	Twelve	3.0
Hans	Y equals X and between brackets four X plus twelve	3.0
Four X times What makes four X squared	Four X times X	3.0
And four X times what makes 12 X	Plus three	3.0
If you apply that then you can write down	Four X and between brackets X plus three	3.0
Tim	Yes	0.0
Where do I have to fill in these two parts	Below the uh	3.0
Wait a minute	No I tried without any	0.0
Right	Yes	0.0
Did you do it yourself without using a table	I did it with the help of	0.0
Not with the help of the answer book I hope	Some of them I did	0.0
What do you learn if you copy it from the answer book	Not much	0.0
Where does it belong	Um below the below the multiplication um sign	3.0
Did you draw the table	Yes	0.0
Because that is part of a multiplication in the equation it doesnt say that you have to multiply two X squared by something	Oh no you need to write it here	3.0
Minus two X times what is minus two X squared	Um I dont know	0.0
Where did the little squared come from Lisa	Oh times X	0.0
Times	X	3.0
Makes minus 54 X	Twentyseven	3.0
Twentyseven		3.0
So what equation do you get with brackets	Minus two X um times X plus 27	3.0
Where does the minus three S squared come from in the table	Um	0.0
Um	Um in front it says three S	3.0
This where do I have to fill this in	Uh underneath	3.0
Where	Uh underneath	3.0
And the plus nine S	Well next to it	3.0
Suggest something	Um in front three S	3.0
In front three S	And then an S at the top	3.0
Three S times S makes	Um no I mean negative S	3.0
And here	Um three	3.0
Three	Yes three	3.0
Thats all	Yes add the plus	3.0
Okay equation	That becomes three S and in between brackets minus S plus three	3.0
Marian	Where did you come up with three S and that minus	2.0
Minus three times	S	3.0
S times	Squared	3.0
Yes squared but I want to resolve it completely to a multiplication	S times S	3.0
Nine S is in fact	Nine times S	3.0
Write further as a multiplication	Three times	3.0
Three times	Three times S	3.0
And what do these two have in common	last times S	3.0
last times S	last times S	3.0
A factor	Three	3.0
And that is the common part which you can write down in front	Sir	0.0
But if you cant do it then take a piece of scratch paper and write it all out on it	I put uh the minus in front of the three S instead of the S	3.0
I put uh the minus in front of the three S instead of the S	Yeah theres no space for that	1.0
What will the upper part look like Freek	The S on top	3.0
This is correct yes	And on the left uh the minus three	3.0
Here	Yes	0.0
What equation would you write down next	H is minus three S and then in brackets S minus three	3.0
But I would	But is it correct then	0.0
Peter	But you have to end up with the highest number up front in front eh	3.0
As many as possible	Oh as many numbers as possible or letters and such	3.0
As long as you can still see a common factor here then you havent taken out enough yet	Oh I see	0.0
What happened to Patty	Over here	0.0
That is correct very well	Sir	0.0
Sir	Sir	0.0
Sir	Is this a little plus sign	0.0
Is this a little plus sign	For if we put minus eight H over here this one over here is 24	3.0
Uh huh	Then again minus 24 H  and then simply plus three	3.0
You had written down in the equation 18 X and	Yes	0.0
Yes	Oh minus	3.0
This one you can already put in the right place	Here	0.0
No just in front	Here	0.0
Now that 18 isnt correct any more is it	No	0.0
You should try to write an S differently than a five dont you think	Is this is this an S then	0.0
I am inclined to say it is 55	Okay	0.0
Yes	Sir I just dont feel well	0.0
The second one	But I I just dont feel well	0.0
Whats the matter	I just dont feel well	0.0
What do you want to do	Outside the classroom I dont really know	0.0
Em	I am just very nauseous	0.0
Yes	With the other ones you could always fill in there you could already do one	3.0
This one where can you put it as well	Here	3.0
That would be S cubed	That has to be S	3.0
Five minutes have been up for a long time	Shoot Im only at three	0.0
Bram	Look at this one it says minus no so that becomes three T Minus three T minus two squared	3.0
B6	And then	0.0
And then	B6	0.0
B6	And then here I have since minus three T youve got to have a T here in any case and over there as well	4.0
Because those two do those two still have anything in common	Oh I could have made this three T	3.0
Yes you are better off making a new table because you are crossing out so much now	So here just a minus	3.0
Yes thats correct	There	0.0
And now here here you took out minus T Where is	It is now over here	3.0
Yes then you have to remove it there	Over here nothing	3.0
And remove that one as well	So then this becomes	0.0
And now you can make the correct equation	Gives minus three T one T	3.0
Which one didnt work	I had this one differently	0.0
The seven P and the 21 do they have anything in common	Um	0.0
Um	Yes	0.0
What is it	Um let me see	0.0
Um let me see	Ah the seven itself	3.0
Let me put it this way Lisa if I would give for example four points for this assignment on a test then you would still have gotten three	Oh right	0.0
Someone who takes out the seven just deserves that extra little point	Yes	0.0
Yes	Can I take your eraser	0.0
Can I take your eraser	Minus three T and then why is this here	3.0
Homework for next time is given in your study calendar	G and P	0.0
Okay	Here it says minus three T Do you have to fill that in over here	0.0
Assignment D Let me see you can fill this in the right place which is not the problem	Yes	0.0
Yes	And then	0.0
And now you have to solve the puzzle	Yes	0.0
But you could have done	Oh	0.0
Because do those two still have anything in common	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Well yes	0.0
Yes	The factor	3.0
Which one	Three	3.0
You could have taken three out as well	Oh right	0.0
Furthermore it says here not that thats a very big deal here it said a plus and you wrote a minus	Oh yeah thats right	0.0
So if you also put the minus in front you better make a new table	Oh right	0.0
Here you dont write a T but	Oh but minus three T	3.0
Just make a new table okay	This one wait a minute over here	0.0
This one wait a minute over here	I had this one is here and then I had this one	0.0
Do these two still have anything in common	Yes	0.0
What	Yes you can divide them again by oh no	3.0
Yes though	Yes that by three uh	3.0
No two H and six you can both be divide by	Two	3.0
And this two you could have taken out as well	Oh	0.0
You are better off in making a new table otherwise you may not understand it anymore	And you dont need to write the one down do you at uh	0.0
No you dont have to write it down but you do have to write the first part of the equation down	Oh	0.0
Thats part of it	Okay	0.0
but then dont write four H but eight minus eight H that will make it correct	Sir I dont get do I need to finish C	0.0
Sir I dont get do I need to finish C	Yes	0.0
Huh	I understand the equation but I dont know how to explain it	0.0
Why	I do understand that I have to end up with six plus nine and one	3.0
Here I will take the same six cells plus two times three	Oh right	0.0
Then you can use this equation	Okay	0.0
But they can both still be correct	Okay	0.0
Uh what is in number 30	Ninetysix	3.0
Right so	Ninetysix  should be correct	3.0
Yes maybe but how do you explain that	Well I did it like this I thought three of these little blocks make one row that left me with two rows that means six	4.0
Well I did it like this I thought three of these little blocks make one row that left me with two rows that means six	And then I had 30 left 30 times three plus six	4.0
Or did you find it yourself	Yes I thought it sounded logical actually	0.0
Look if all you say is three are added each time	So you have to keep adding until youre there	3.0
And if you argue from there on you will figure it out as well	Sir	0.0
They are going to be looking at it in Hong Kong	Then they will know right away that they may take a piece of paper of mine	0.0
Tell me what did you want to ask	The T Why is the T R	2.0
Yes	I just see how how how do you have to do that	2.0
Here you had to to demonstrate two of them	Yes Ive got those	0.0
So at T five you calculate 10 plus four times three	Yes	0.0
What is the relationship between the number of the term and your equation	It is one less each time	4.0
It is one less each time	This one is	0.0
Is that correct here	Yes	0.0
At T 20	Nineteen	3.0
Why dont you go ahead and apply that	Oh right then that makes N minus one	3.0
Well perfect isnt it	But how does it work here	2.0
But how does it work here	In the row five seven nine 11 13 is T one five	2.0
In the row five seven nine 11 13 is T one five	Then this must be T two T three T four T five	2.0
Yes	The difference between two terms is the same each time	3.0
The difference between two terms is the same each time	We call a series like that an arithmetical series	3.0
Yes	Each number in this series is T one plus N minus one	3.0
Times two	Yes	0.0
It is almost the same as the one you got here right	But then you explain why the equation for the arithmetical series can be written as T N T and	3.0
But then you explain why the equation for the arithmetical series can be written as T N T and	I dont understand that one	2.0
Do you recognize the part that is on the board	Yes	0.0
In this in this equation	Yes	0.0
Yes	Those brackets	3.0
Go ahead and try lets say try to get rid of those brackets entirely	X But may I now write this one here as well	0.0
What is two times N	Two N	3.0
Not two to the power of N but just two N Thats right	Where did you get this three	2.0
T N yes write it down T N equals equals	T one	3.0
One plus whatever is in your table	Two N minus two	3.0
Two N minus two	No without times two then	3.0
In this this row	Five	3.0
And try to shorten it Bram	I dont get B three	0.0
I dont get B three	What are you supposed to do here do you have to simply	2.0
Yes fill in the equation	Do you simply have to do one plus three	3.0
Yes this means that you fill in one for N and that means that you have to fill in twenty for N	So you have to do twenty plus three	3.0
Yes so you only have to fill it in into the equation	Twenty times 20 equals 20 squared	4.0
Huh	And so here you put 20 squared	3.0
Yes	Isnt it better here to calculate minus four T plus three	3.0
The table is not really correct because minus four T times two	Oh no thats not possible is it	3.0
You will never get eight T squared out of that	Minus two right	3.0
If you calculate this multiplication what do you get then	Um eight T	3.0
Just	Yes now it should work	3.0
Just continue changing the rest	What	2.0
G and P	Can I reserve the fifth for tomorrow	0.0
But I am actually happy that you admit it now	Yes but	0.0
Raphaela	No	0.0
Try to express your problem	Well there is a minus there	3.0
This one	Yes	0.0
Now what about that minus sign	Well doesnt it mean something	2.0
Has your question been answered or not quite yet	Well one could also just calculate without the bracket	3.0
Tomi	Well just go ahead and calculate instead of  do the intermediate step	3.0
How do you mean that	Well simply calculate minus three A X plus two B Y now and then leave the brack bracket	3.0
Samuel	Three U plus four V	3.0
Yes Samuel	Six X Y plus four X Y and minus seven A A B plus three A B	4.0
What is the common expression that I will factorize Philipp	Two A minus five B	3.0
Now how does the content of the second bracket develop Philipp	Seven M minus five N and minus three N mi minus two N	4.0
Equals Benjamin what do we get	Hm two X squared minus one times nine Y	3.0
And also	Thanks	0.0
Mhm yes	Do you have to indicate the factorizing at the rear	0.0
No thats a transformation the two terms are absolutely equal	Minus in brackets	3.0
Minus in brackets	Hm what	2.0
Hm what	Minus in brackets	3.0
I dont have it yet	Mhm yes	0.0
Under what circumstances can	Actually it should be a zero there too	3.0
Well then write it down From one of the two  thats a special case	Maam is that right	0.0
I dont know if thats a beneficial beginning	Cant you do that	0.0
Do it first in your notebook	Yees	0.0
Hm then it gets problematic right because youve got X squared and X	How con you solve this	2.0
If we pose this question in connection with factorizing maybe factorizing could help us along the track	Can this be right	0.0
That can very possibly be right	what I have to do	0.0
Five cannot be zero Barbara	Is it correct now like that	0.0
Hmm well it is correct but how do you continue now	Well thats actually what I was going to ask about	2.0
Well thats actually what I was going to ask about	Cant one the X over there well minus 25 on this side	4.0
Cant one the X over there well minus 25 on this side	then its minus 25 over there then there is still that bracket over there and then divide by this bracket on this side	4.0
But you have got the X twice in there	Yes thats just it	0.0
Well then	If you calculate that it becomes X to the second power again	4.0
Look Raphaela you still have a sum	Thats just it	0.0
Isnt there a possibility to write this whole sum as a product	Well two	3.0
Esti	Of a binomial formula	3.0
What is it this expression	What which which case	0.0
Yes	The third	3.0
Mh not sure	I dont know the number I mean	0.0
How can it be factorized that was my original question Michelle	X plus five to the power of two	3.0
This square is zero how do we continue Anette	If one number times a number is zero or a term times a term is zero then one or both of them has to be zero	4.0
If one number times a number is zero or a term times a term is zero then one or both of them has to be zero	And as both are the same X is plus five equals zero	4.0
This square can only be zero if X plus five is zero which means that X has to have what value Klaus	Hm does X have to be minus five	0.0
Okay well you can do a little mental calculation right	You know yesterday I calculated  11 times 11 as basic area	3.0
Eleven times 11 equals	One hundred and twentyone	3.0
Eleven times what equals 121	Eleven	3.0
Mmh yes	Is this correct like that	0.0
Hoho they are	something like that eh and then minus 14 14	3.0
something like that eh and then minus 14 14	Is that correct	0.0
There is just one trifle missing it has to be equal	Oh and then its correct	0.0
Thats true yes well done	Is X 11	3.0
X is 11 in the second one look I covered it at the front	Ah	0.0
Some of you have already solved the third one Shane move on	Thats the third one it says A plus B and A minus B	3.0
Mmh yes	Ehm is X	3.0
One hundred and nine sixtynine	One hundred and sixtynine	3.0
Ah excuse me I read 169 from here it is 196	Ah 196	3.0
Have you got the third one	Eh just until here	0.0
One of them is zero or the other thus X minus 14 must be zero or second variant Benjamin	X plus 14 has to be zero	3.0
X plus 14 has to be zero and that will give us for X the two solutions	Fourteen or minus 14	3.0
Barbara	Well eh solution set equals ehm minus 14 and then well ehm yes	3.0
Semi semicolon	Yes semicolon and then 14	3.0
I will list them the two solutions	You cant really see it anymore	0.0
Anette	Now could one just write absolute solution value 14	3.0
Pardon	Could one a little there	0.0
I just dont want to show the solution yet	Could you show that in the back there once again	0.0
Now you have to finish the calculation Marc	Then X equals minus three point three	3.0
How can you proceed in order to get six X squared in the product	Well three and two right	3.0
There you somehow have to make a decision you have to try it out	Mhm yes	0.0
In the last place it has to be a three	Mhm yes	0.0
If you have the number of three here then you take two X to the right	Minus two X	3.0
Minus or just two X equals plus three	Well then ask her	0.0
That would be one variant yes	six X and there X and three X and two X two X are three	4.0
You just wrote it the other way around	Well yes but but well somehow it has to be the other way around can it partially be too	3.0
Basically the two possibilities stand open	Yes	0.0
And to find what is correct you ascertain that using the middle term afterwards	Mhm yes	0.0
How can you get the product minus three with integers for now	Plus three times minus one	3.0
How can I recognize if one of these four solutions is the correct one Samuel	Well it I have to obtain seven X	3.0
Minus six plus three equals Hansueli	Minus three X	3.0
Jeanine	Mmh  X	0.0
Six times three X six X times three	Eighteen	3.0
And	Minus o well one	3.0
There are Corinne	Nine X	3.0
Nine X and what else	Minus one X	3.0
Three X times minus one is	Two X	3.0
Three X times minus one is minus three X and then	Plus five X	3.0
Pay attention dont be nervous	Six X	3.0
Nine X	Ehm nine X minus eh two X equals seven X	4.0
Now Ive got six X squared plus seven X minus three	Two	3.0
Hansueli	Ehm three X plus one and the second bracket two X minus three	3.0
Lets multiply everything properly once again	Ehm six X squared	3.0
Six X squared	Ehm minus nine X	3.0
Minus nine X	Two X	3.0
Plus minus	Eh plus	3.0
Plus two X and	Minus three	3.0
Shall I put it up for you to see once more	Yes could you	0.0
Yes could you	Yes please	0.0
Should anybody still have questions then raise your hand now so that I can pass by	What problems do we have to do now 14	0.0
They are all equations that you have to solve	Well the	0.0
The solutions are there in the front as usual you can check if your results are correct or not	Eh youre standing right in my way	0.0
Yes	Do I have to  number 11  now	0.0
What do you mean	Ehm now	0.0
Ehm now	I have	0.0
But for what we are trying out right now	Yes eh	0.0
Its 14A 15B and 17B actually 16 too	Mhm	0.0
Mhm	Yes	0.0
Homework was all right	Hmm yes I continued a little bit there	0.0
When you have solved some already Christoph you can just as well go and check your answers in the solution booklet if they are correct	Mhm yes	0.0
Its laying in the front	Mhm yes	0.0
Mhm well it is actually all about recognizing the binomial formulas	Yes yes	0.0
Yes yes	then eh yes  X minus three	3.0
then you will need a whole page only for one problem and wont be able to keep the overview anymore or everything will become too big	Yes sure	0.0
Yes good	Maam	0.0
Thats correct	Is that right	0.0
Yes	See	0.0
See	Mrs  could you please come	0.0
Its just a little bit strange that you always take your X to the right when you write it	Yes I did it differently this time	0.0
You can be original if you like	I always do it like that	0.0
Yes	Yes then this should be that or that and there are these two solutions right	0.0
Yes then this should be that or that and there are these two solutions right	But Hansueli has a completely different solu	1.0
No he is working on 14	Ah yes we just had to do the three listed in the front right	0.0
And look if you want to write it in short form you can of course just list it after your consideration	Mhm yes	0.0
Tomi nice presentation please	Yes I know	0.0
Well why dont you do it then	Yes	0.0
Yes	I dont know	0.0
Are you sure that it is minus Jeanine	No plus	3.0
Yes yes you see 15 B can hardly be considered as a B problem because everything is so wonderfully factorized already hm	Ehm Mam	0.0
Five sixth yes correct	Should I write seven minus X	3.0
Should I write seven minus X	You dont know where the minus could be	3.0
A	That one D	0.0
Eh D It has to be X squared	But	0.0
If X minus seven is zero then X is seven and if seven minus X is zero then X is also seven	Mhm yes	0.0
See it doesnt matter in which order you write it	Ehm does it matter which one I do first	0.0
Now do you mean at the listing	Yes	0.0
Do you know	Then its still correct like that	0.0
One can imagine it directly on the number line that way	Yes	0.0
Thats the advantage hm but	How do I have to do this now	0.0
One hundred and fortyfour is the square of what number	Of 24	3.0
Hmm no	No	0.0
Eleven times 11 we saw before and whats next	Twelve times 12	3.0
Thats not necessary	Oh yes	0.0
Thats not necessary	There is no square number here in number E	3.0
Where	E	3.0
E	E	1.0
E Two X and three in the back doesnt that work out	Ah two X times eh plus three	3.0
For tomorrow please just do this first problem 14 A	The whole thing	0.0
It goes fast	No	0.0
Did you solve the wrong one	No I did two F and the next two	0.0
What else	Is that right in the brackets there	0.0
Is that right in the brackets there	Because that is they skipped it just like that	0.0
Because that is they skipped it just like that	It is not finished yet I know but	0.0
But now there is no A plus B anymore there in the back	Goodbye everyone	0.0
You factorized A plus B here	Mhm yes	0.0
Nine X plus eight X minus that but it is thats that	Is that minu is that minus or	3.0
Thats that	that it becomes a minus	3.0
Right	Yes I just wanted well	0.0
Close your books	Eh Mr can we watch the video sometime	0.0
Sure	At the end of the lesson	0.0
Anja	Two lengths	3.0
Anja	I draw this length twice eh three times next to each other	3.0
Now explain to me what I should do on the other straight line Bal Rafael	I take the compass of three centimeters and mark it from the right to the left	3.0
What exactly are you doing with these three with the length three that you have been adapting to the compass	Eh I subtract it from from the lower straight line from the right to the left	3.0
How many times	Twice	3.0
Anja	Nine	3.0
Comment on what youre doing	Well you have to eh five plus five plus five plus five minus three	4.0
Well you have to eh five plus five plus five plus five minus three	Well can I present it in one step	0.0
Well can I present it in one step	Without minus	3.0
Esti	Yes I think so	1.0
Yes I think so	Well maybe you should ehm move over ehm the yellow one	3.0
Well maybe you should ehm move over ehm the yellow one	So that its  with the line	1.0
So that its  with the line	Yes exactly	1.0
Can you show it Tamara	Ehm down there	0.0
Yes	Here	0.0
From the left margin of the blackboard to the margin of the sheet on the right	Yes	0.0
Do you have another idea	Mhm yes	0.0
Namely	Eh five and four times the three times the five	4.0
Sandra please also comment on what youre doing	Five times three	4.0
Five times three	Plus three times three	4.0
Christoph	Plus three	3.0
Jenny	Equals 27	3.0
And further Andi	Ehm you ehm have to if you calculate three times five you have to take the three five times and not one sheet of five and one of three	4.0
Tamara	A length of eight	3.0
In reality that would be another length Patrick	Six	3.0
Not 27 or 26 but a total length would be here	teen	3.0
At the blackboard	So five times five equals equals 25	4.0
Stephanie	Equals ten	3.0
Equals ten	Well cant I multi eh multiply that	3.0
Desiree	He should put up all sheets of five because thats the only way they can be 25	4.0
He should put up all sheets of five because thats the only way they can be 25	Because we also have to count five and five and five	4.0
Well That way yes I will let Anja explain too	Ehm five is just like a length of five centimeters and five five is 10 centimeters	4.0
Ehm five is just like a length of five centimeters and five five is 10 centimeters	But you want 25	1.0
One moment do you understand that	Yes ah the	0.0
Michelle	I would only mark it four times	3.0
So there are two opinions opposing each other to mark it five times or four times	Four times	3.0
Adrian are you satisfied with your work	Yes	0.0
Anja	I would have put the two threes under	3.0
Adrian can go back to his seat	No its wrong	3.0
Was that clear before	Yeah yeah	0.0
Are you aware of why youre making arrowheads	No	0.0
No	Not really	0.0
What does the arrow indicate	Oh yes I know	0.0
Oh yes I know	Where it goes through well it goes this way and afterwards at the lower line it continues that way	3.0
Mhm yes well the	Yes	0.0
What calculating operation	Plus	3.0
Thats why you go in the opposite direction with minus	Minus	0.0
Here it would be nine hm	Mhm yes	0.0
Could you also do the problem at the blackboard	With the sheets	0.0
Fabian	Eh mark the five three times ehm on one line	3.0
Esti	Also three times the five and then one times the three on the second line	4.0
In the	In the counter direction	3.0
Carmen	Two times the five and in the counter direction one times the three That is minus	4.0
Two times the five and in the counter direction one times the three That is minus	Plus eh	1.0
Rafael	Eh not so exact but it is correct	3.0
If you say not so exact what is it that is not so exact	Eh the lines	3.0
Mhm I see	Not so exact	3.0
But basically its correct	Eh	0.0
Patrick please read it out loud	are drawn	0.0
Three	X Y and Z	3.0
So how do we present the term X plus Y minus Z Fabian	First the just draw a line somewhere a	3.0
Exactly the way that you instruct me to	Then put a starting point somewhere	3.0
Yes	And then mark the length X	4.0
And then mark the length X	From this point mark the length Y	4.0
From this point mark the length Y	And then a second length	4.0
Line	Eh line and then from this point at the Y  ehm in the counter direction Z	3.0
Menhir	It is correct	0.0
Or did you think it was correct	Yes	0.0
Yes explain	That eh thats the eh the last length which Fabian drew just now	1.0
Yes	He he actually should have drawn the length X the length Y and the length Z	1.0
Can you also describe it in words what your head shaking means	Hrm no its correct	1.0
Hrm no its correct	Because	0.0
Because	Because X plus Y minus Z is equal to a length and that length you have to in	4.0
Think about E	E	0.0
It will come out even better Fabian and Menhir if you comment on what you are doing	Eh well here we have drawn a straight line and eh a starting point and now we will mark Y here the first time	4.0
Eh well here we have drawn a straight line and eh a starting point and now we will mark Y here the first time	From this point once more once more	4.0
From this point once more once more	And	4.0
And	The yellow here thats the length five times Y	4.0
Rafael	Thats correct	1.0
Which one	C	0.0
Also C	We mark the length Z three times	3.0
From where to where does three Z go	Mh from here to here	0.0
Christoph	Its correct	1.0
Please go ahead then	Im making a length again	3.0
Length	Eh a straight line	4.0
Eh a straight line	And mark the starting point	4.0
And mark the starting point	Then Im marking Y	4.0
Then Im marking Y	And four times Z	4.0
And four times Z	Now thats the the length	4.0
What length	Y plus four times Z	3.0
Two times X plus Z	All right I draw a straight line	3.0
All right I draw a straight line	Put a point somewhere	1.0
Put a point somewhere	Then I mark Y twice	4.0
Then I mark Y twice	And then Z once again	4.0
Jenny	Its correct	1.0
The letter E does not stand for a length anymore but in our case Debbie	Admission fee for an adult	3.0
In exactly the same way the letter K stands for Pascal	Eh the admission fee for a child	3.0
The letter A means in our case Tamara	Additional charge for a locker	3.0
And finally the letter B according to our problem Menhir	Additional charge for a cabin	3.0
Please explain Fabian	Ehm the family has to consist of five people	3.0
Mhm yes namely	Two adults and three children	3.0
It consists of two adults three children What else	They take three lockers and one cabin	3.0
All right good morning everybody	Good morning	0.0
I heard that Joel you were about to say something	No no no nothing	0.0
Only one person can move the chair okay	Thanks	0.0
Youre welcome	To do the calculations you have to find  calculations so that you can find this measure of the straw	3.0
Yes	Madam but and when is not	0.0
Also observe your instructions a little bit eh	Madam can we already cut it	0.0
Of course you can already cut it yes	Madam Madam can we	0.0
Have you found the best position	Eh	0.0
Well cut it	And if its wrong	0.0
In case its wrong you take another piece and then you use the rest of the straw	Eh its forty point five	3.0
Eh its forty point five	Eh yes	0.0
Eh yes	You do it that way	0.0
You do it that way	Put it a little	0.0
Put it a little	You measure forty	3.0
You measure forty	Forty point five	1.0
Forty point five	Well well this is the length	3.0
Look you have instructions eh that are already given	Ah already	0.0
Try to cut it and then if it doesnt work youll take another piece of straw and try	We only cut one piece	0.0
Find the longest straw that you can place in your box mhm yes	Madam like this its longer	3.0
Madam like this its longer	calculate it like this	3.0
So did you already cut the straw	No	0.0
Look you have already got the the instructions	Yes yes but we have already found	0.0
Yes yes but we have already found	We have already found it	0.0
Complete the sheet	But dont we have to do the calculations	0.0
But dont we have to do the calculations	We weve got it	0.0
You have inserted cut and measured it	Yes	0.0
Then now you can try with the calculations to check if this length corresponds to what you have measured	the diagonal like this so	3.0
So complete Here with your situation with your straw you have the box number two and you put it do it again here	Ah we have to do	0.0
And then start doing this call me to have a look at it when youve finished	Like this Madam	0.0
Now have you found the straw and have you measured it	Yes	0.0
Insert the straw What if I so in your opinion what is the longest straw laying in the box	No no shorter	3.0
No no shorter	Shorter	1.0
One thats shorter	Like this	0.0
If not Ill give you another straw if you need one	We have finished	0.0
We have finished	We have finished	0.0
Everybody has his own	That means together	0.0
So in a few words with the straw inserted like this in reality it isnt of any use that the box is high it could also be a box thats very flat	Yes good	0.0
Its already very flat yours is really	Yes	0.0
Try to think about if you utilize the fact that this one is high	You can do it like this	3.0
You can do it like this	Place it like this	1.0
Place it like this	Raise it raise it	1.0
Raise it raise it	Like this yes	3.0
Like this yes	No	1.0
No	Its not like that perhaps here	1.0
Its not like that perhaps here	Like this	3.0
This distance here	How do you do it	2.0
Like you said	like this	0.0
Try to cut it	Be careful	0.0
Yes without forcing it	Eh  like this	0.0
Now how can I calculate the length of this straw	No you do it here	3.0
Where are the instructions	Here	0.0
Then you know how long it is how wide it is how high it is	we find	0.0
Now reason within the group explain it to them	Madam in what sense are these calculations	0.0
Have you found the longest straw	Yes yes	0.0
So then how is it	Like this	3.0
Without bending it eh you cant bend the straw	We did it that way	0.0
No no no without bending it eh without bending it	Aha	0.0
You havent found it yet try to thin try to place the straw into it without bending it eh	No	0.0
No	First	0.0
First	Once  and once here	0.0
Once  and once here	Why	2.0
Why	Because its written here	4.0
What is the position	Like this	3.0
Now are you calculating its length	Yes	0.0
How do you do it	We measure	3.0
Now you have to calculate the length of the straw	With the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate	3.0
With the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate	And because we placed it oblique	4.0
But try to cut the straw corresponding to the diagonal and insert the straw corresponding to the diagonal	Yes but	0.0
Yes but	Its from there to there to here	3.0
Its from there to there to here	No wait wait wait	1.0
No wait wait wait	Like this we see	3.0
Like this we see	Let it go	0.0
Let it go	Good cut it down here	0.0
Good cut it down here	No	0.0
But it I know	Ah but now if I have this and this if I have this and this Ill find it	4.0
Ah but now if I have this and this if I have this and this Ill find it	I I I know that you need to do the the the the the	0.0
I I I know that you need to do the the the the the	But no but because this one here is practically the diagonal if you do her above  thats it	4.0
But no but because this one here is practically the diagonal if you do her above  thats it	No its right	0.0
Listen to Boris and then try to observe this sheet and complete it	Okay listen	0.0
Okay listen	Eh the diagonal here	3.0
Mhm yes	Right	0.0
Or as we said Instead of writing this I can write	This	0.0
But now try you are calculating other boxes	Yes but	0.0
After some time it seems to be the same thing	Only that	0.0
Its quite a lot wider eh	But indeed its right	0.0
And then theres the and then there is the	Ah already because its longer	4.0
Afterwards there is the height which is different but the afterwards we will see that its right	But its right indeed	0.0
Its correct eh what you are calculating but Id like to see if you can shorten the calculation also write the unit eh	Madam we have found it	0.0
Found	Well we used we have the Pythagorean theorem	3.0
Mhm yes	that we know  and now we got	0.0
Try afterwards to calculate those too the diagonals that you got from the other groups	Because here	0.0
By doing these calculations what did you apply	The Pythagorean theorem	3.0
Yes	Will you write it or shall I write it	0.0
Will you write it or shall I write it	Madam	0.0
In your exercise book eh	Do we have to fill in all of them	0.0
When you have finished yours continue filling in from the other groups too yes	in scribble or do we have	0.0
There is the box zero the bo and start doing the calculations like this for the others seeing what the others found with their boxes	We are inexact	3.0
You are inexact what do you mean	Well we have practically found that the longest straw is this	3.0
Well we have practically found that the longest straw is this	The diagonal from here to here	1.0
The diagonal from here to here	Yes	1.0
Yes	We found it with the diagonal	3.0
We found it with the diagonal	From here to here	1.0
From here to here	From here to here	1.0
From here to here	Mine worked but the straw is this other one	3.0
Mine worked but the straw is this other one	Its logical because if you put it from here to here it will get longer	4.0
It means that what you calculated isnt the length of the straw	So we what	0.0
But its only the diagonal from the box from from the circumference of the base from the box from the rectangle lets say the base	We have to find from here to here many	3.0
Mhm yes Use this the measure you have already found	Thirtynine point three	3.0
So now is this one here the right one	Yes	0.0
Also cut the one placed on the base	Ah that way	0.0
Ah that way	That way	0.0
Yes with the but dont the straw after no yes mhm yes	Cut	0.0
Cut	This	0.0
This	Ah that	0.0
It gets placed in the same	Like this	0.0
Like this	In the same trajectory	3.0
Now here you have already calculated	This	0.0
This	We calculated this	0.0
Now observe how to calculate the other	Using the Pythagorean theorem	3.0
Using the Pythagorean theorem	Using the Pythagorean theorem	1.0
Using the Pythagorean theorem	So its thirtynine point six squared	3.0
So its thirtynine point six squared	Minus	1.0
Minus	Plus	1.0
Plus	Minus	1.0
Minus	Plus	1.0
Plus	You have to find the hypotenuse	3.0
You have to find the hypotenuse	Plus twelve	3.0
Plus twelve	this one  here	0.0
this one  here	And then you have to do this plus this	3.0
And then you have to do this plus this	Ah its true	0.0
Afterwards you can also solve them underneath it	Ah but	0.0
No	But here eh here	0.0
But here eh here	But its right	0.0
Afterwards write it also here but start afterwards write it again	Madam but here  do we have to write the same things like here	0.0
Done	Yes	0.0
Yes	Madam	0.0
Have you completed the transparency	Yes	0.0
Yes	We didnt get as far as finding what  fast  the fast calculations	0.0
It isnt because youre slow but you can do it with a single calculation eh	Even faster	0.0
Even faster	Madam its true that here  the Pythagorean theorem	3.0
You square it plus square this	Yes	0.0
Isnt it like I told you yesterday	Ah right	0.0
Ah right	To already use the	0.0
I and then in reality instead of writing this	Eh but why we	0.0
Eh but why we	We have to take the square root of this	3.0
Try to think about what I have to write	Madam do we now have to check the boxes with the others	0.0
Tell me	We have found it	0.0
Tell me	Ive been thinking	0.0
Have you finished have you completed here you write me here you havent completed yet eh	Ah do we also have to do this too	0.0
Mhm yes	Here	0.0
Number three you can you only have to fill in the same thing	Madam	0.0
Yes	All the calculations	0.0
Mhm yes	Madam by doing the question we got a result that doesnt	3.0
Madam by doing the question we got a result that doesnt	Why	2.0
Well I think there will be something wrong	Were done	0.0
Complete case number two with your solution	Yes	0.0
Shall I leave it here	Yes	0.0
Yes	But here you can directly	0.0
What did you apply to find these measurements	The Pythagorean theorem	3.0
And here write down the calculations of your box too eh	Ive written it here	0.0
The I Your I is only this one isnt it	The hypotenuse which	3.0
Draw it in and write the I	No but then you wont understand well if I write	0.0
No do it in colors	Eh yes	0.0
Call it straw or call it	Is diagonal of the base okay	3.0
Ready Lucia	Yes yes yes	0.0
Do you still need the box	No	0.0
Have you finished yours eh	Yes	0.0
So in the transparency you have the box number zero	Madam do we have to color them	0.0
Madam do we have to color them	All of the	0.0
Yes yes	Madam but	0.0
What	If weve made mistakes with the calculations	0.0
Complete it here with your calculations	Here	0.0
Then if you dont need it any more bring you box scissors tape measure to the table	Look how easy it is Only changing all the measurements	0.0
Also the straws are to be brought here eh not to be played with	Madam	0.0
Madam	Here I have this  has this	0.0
Take the first calculation	Eh but	0.0
If you have already filled in the transparency no Ill bring it to you now eh to fill in	You need to	0.0
Now you do the same calculations with the other boxes	We take	0.0
Bring the material over there now Ill give you the transparency to complete	Do we have to do it in red	0.0
No in blue	No not this	0.0
No not this	Its this	0.0
Its this	Yes	0.0
Yes	And now how should I do	0.0
Tell me	Is it right like this	0.0
Have you done yours	Yes	0.0
But it gives you a straw of 880 centimeters	Eh yes	0.0
This here	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	No this	0.0
No this	Here inside	0.0
Theres something that doesnt work	We can try to do the calculations again	0.0
We can try to do the calculations again	Try to do this piece here	0.0
Try to do this piece here	It equals 48	3.0
Marisa what did you do	Okay thirtyeight point five squared plus 25 squared  to find this diagonal here	3.0
Mhm yes	Now its more	3.0
Having a rectangular triangle	Right angle side right angle side	3.0
Which is the hypotenuse	The hypotenuse is this one	3.0
Eh yes	And these are the other two sides	3.0
But this triangle here	No	0.0
No	This is a side and this is the other	3.0
This is a side and this is the other	This is a side that is a side and this is the hypotenuse	3.0
So if you have found this you already have calculated it	Yes	0.0
Its 55	Squared plus  16 squared and then extracting the root of everything	3.0
Do you agree	Mhm yes	1.0
Mhm yes	We have found it	0.0
We have found it	Is it right like this	0.0
Is it right like this	I get an expression	0.0
And where can I simplify again	No	0.0
Are you done with the transparency	Yes	0.0
Have you already completed the transparency	ah no the transparency not yet	0.0
You have to complete with are you doing number three or number four	Three	0.0
Found	Eh yes I think so	0.0
In the meanwhile Andrea	Madam may I ask you	0.0
Go on put it inside Claudio	Wait	0.0
Wait	Assio its your pen	0.0
No mine	No why	0.0
Sqaure this plus fourteen point seven squared root	Ah I can use the properties of powers	3.0
Be careful I squar	Plus eh you cant use the properties of powers	3.0
Here is the square root now the sum then extract the root I square	But first	0.0
First we extract the root then we square it	Ah so you can take away the root its this	3.0
Which root can I take away	This	3.0
This	No	1.0
No	This because squar taking away the square root and then squaring it isnt of any use	4.0
This because squar taking away the square root and then squaring it isnt of any use	But the	0.0
Here I extract the root of it all and then I square it again	Dividing by two doesnt make sense	3.0
Have you done	Here we have to do it in the simplified way or	3.0
Have you measured it	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
The result you found	The same thing that we wrote down here	0.0
Yes exactly	Now here you extend the same scheme	0.0
Yes and afterwards try to do what the others have done with the other other boxes	Okay	0.0
And pay attention extract the root but you have to extract what else	Eh	0.0
Eh	I told you	0.0
Why do you take the box	To do the faster thing	0.0
What did you apply in solid geometry	Boh	0.0
Boh	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	The Pythagorean theorem	3.0
Finished	square root direct	3.0
square root direct	And that without eh without	0.0
The direct square root what what is that	What is the direct square root	2.0
What is the direct square root	Is the  and then you have to square it and immediately extract the root	3.0
Is the  and then you have to square it and immediately extract the root	This  the last time	0.0
This  the last time	Ah	0.0
Ah	Do you remember	0.0
But instead of doing two calculations try to see if you could do it with a single one	Its enough to do	0.0
Its enough to do	Put it a bit  below	0.0
Try to write it	Lets do it here go on	0.0
Lets do it here go on	What	2.0
What you just told me now	Now here Im going to write the same	0.0
What have we applied in solid geometry that we havent ever done Neluca	The Pythagorean theorem	3.0
You had box number	Eh one	0.0
Eh one	One	0.0
One or two	One	0.0
Do it at the blackboard	Yes	0.0
Yes	So first eh in practice we put together the two calculations	3.0
So first eh in practice we put together the two calculations	Do I have to write down the two calculations here	0.0
So observe the difference between the written calculation on the overhead and the calculation that she is writing now on the blackboard	In practice we put together eh the first calculation that that we have eh we have put together the two calculationseh but we simplify because in practice the calculation was like this at the beginning	4.0
In practice we put together eh the first calculation that that we have eh we have put together the two calculationseh but we simplify because in practice the calculation was like this at the beginning	Only extracting the root and then squaring it isnt of any use	4.0
Only extracting the root and then squaring it isnt of any use	So we simplified we we took away the root and we squared it	4.0
The result	The result is the same	3.0
Yes Im raising it now	Thanks	0.0
The overhead projector doesnt work well	But can we	0.0
Have you finished	Yes	0.0
Are they correct	Yes yes	0.0
You dont have to do the other dont  start doing this afterwards in case well see next time to to work on it again	Well I didnt under well I didnt understa I didnt understand  how to arrange	2.0
This number here you transferred here	Mhm yes	0.0
Mhm yes	Yes	0.0
And I used that to find this number here	Yes	0.0
I did this which in reality was this	This	0.0
This	Mhm yes	0.0
Instead of writing this number I could write this calculation	Mhm yes	0.0
I can write this squared plus this squared	And then	2.0
plus 166 which would be 13 squared	okay Ill do it that way	0.0
Mhm yes yes	Madam	0.0
But its the same as you told me last time  is 2000	Do you remember that you told me already last time that there	0.0
Eh	What am I doing wrong	2.0
What am I doing wrong	I should extract the root	2.0
I should extract the root	Ah its true	1.0
the result down here if you extract the root	And the root	3.0
Boris got it	Yes	0.0
Is it right now	Yes	0.0
Yes	But down here	0.0
But down here	Yes	0.0
We will start nicely we will start with Gregoire With A X plus five equals eight	Well we must take away five	3.0
We do minus five	We do minus five therefore X is equal to three	4.0
Guillaume	Er X plus three is equal to minus five	4.0
Er X plus three is equal to minus five	We must take away er minus three	4.0
So we mustnt take away minus three	It makes minus three	3.0
So we must add minus three or do minus three	It makes minus three	3.0
It makes minus three	And X is equal to eight to minus eight	3.0
Er Florence	Er X minus six equals 30	4.0
Er X minus six equals 30	Therefore we do plus six which means X equals 36	4.0
Katia	Er well er the solution is five	3.0
Now that we are learning what to do what do you do	Well	0.0
What do we do to make our equation equivalent	I did three times five	4.0
I did three times five	The first is 15 then the second is two times five plus five	4.0
So there youre groping about	Yeah	0.0
Herve	To take away the Xs	3.0
Yes	X is equal to something	3.0
Valentine	We do minus two X	3.0
We do minus two X	Well there it stays one X to the three X	3.0
Three X minus two X makes one X	the two X and then er	3.0
It suppresses the two X and what stays	What stays is X is equal to plus five	3.0
Aurore what can we say for E	We do minus four X	3.0
Which gives us X equal to	Minus eight	3.0
Yeah Herve	Well er since we want to eliminate the eight well since we want to find X we put we do plus eight X	4.0
So if we do plus eight X What happens if we do plus eight X	Ha yeah	0.0
What do we want	Well	0.0
Well	There should be one X	3.0
So Camille	Nine X	3.0
In doing plus nine X in doing plus nine X whats interesting is that here we have X because plus nine X minus eight X	It makes X	3.0
It makes X is equal to	Seventeen	3.0
So for G we have three X plus five is is equal to two X Ludivine	Minus	3.0
Minus	Minus 30	3.0
Minus 30	Yeah	0.0
Okay so we can do it all in one stage	No	0.0
So what do we want to do first	Minus two	3.0
And then it gives us	X plus five	3.0
X plus five is equal to	Minus three	3.0
Whats bothering us	Minus five	3.0
Its the five which is bothering us therefore we do	Minus five	3.0
Therefore X is equal to	Minus 35	3.0
What must we choose first	Minus 17	3.0
So on the right we only have the	The numbers	3.0
Its	Minus 24	3.0
Therefore what must I do to take away this minus 24	Plus 24	3.0
Therefore the 18 X that Im going to subtract minus 17 X theres going to stay	X	3.0
Theres enough to amuse oneself until 957	Sir	0.0
Yes	949 I dont need to	0.0
But youve done it right here	But yes but A we did with you	0.0
So	And er here B	0.0
Yeah you want to isolate you want to isolate what	Er I yeah but I havent understood	2.0
Its that one there	Yeah therefore I do minus	3.0
How do you get minus seven to become zero	Er I do plus plus eight er	3.0
Er I do plus plus eight er	Plus seven	3.0
The two Xs will stay there	Two X is equal to seven	3.0
Minus 19 when theres plus seven it makes minus 12	Uhum	0.0
Youve badly written the things but your calculation is correct	Yeah	0.0
Now you want that only that only X therefore you	Times a half	3.0
You find X equals minus six	Yeah I did it correctly	0.0
Whats bothering you	The five	0.0
Therefore	I do plus minus five	3.0
find 20 minus five it equals well	Fifteen	3.0
And then you must divide by no you must dividetheres not 15 which must you must simply divide by	Seven	3.0
Seven	Twenty	3.0
By	By a quarter	3.0
You must find 15 quarters as a solution	Sir	0.0
Yes	The thing  must it always be on the left	0.0
Not necessarily you can also put it on the right	Always X on the left	3.0
will have minus one X so we must multiply again by minus one	Sir	0.0
Yes	Its always the same thing 949	3.0
So what will you be staying with	We inverse	3.0
We inverse	Bah	0.0
Bah	Three X	3.0
Three X	48	3.0
Three X three X equals	Fortyeight	3.0
Fortyeight	No er 36	3.0
And then you can do times	A third	3.0
So were going to do additions and multiplications together	Ah	0.0
Ah	Yeah okay	0.0
Hum hum	Yeah yeah its okay	0.0
Its okay	Thank you	0.0
Youre welcome	Sir	0.0
Yes	Theres a problem with C	3.0
Whats the problem with C	I cant I cant do it C	0.0
Take away five	Yeah	0.0
So what happens when you take away five	Oh well there also it goes away	3.0
The four X stays	Yeah	0.0
When four objects are worth 15 francs what do you do to know the price of an object	Well I divide by er four	3.0
Yeah take a quarter	Ah	0.0
Ah	Yeah	0.0
X equals fifteen over four	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How	2.0
Yes	There if we divide by four the plus five must also be divided by four	4.0
Therefore we dont divide by four	No	0.0
No	If we take away the five afterwards we have four X is equal to 15	4.0
And then	And then we can	0.0
Then its not divided by four fifteen	Yes but it does have decimal points	3.0
Ho poor little one if it does have decimal points are they so painful decimal points	No	0.0
Ha good	But Sir	0.0
Exactly	seventyfive  the fraction	3.0
Youve divided 15 by four thats 15 quarters	Er	0.0
So thats annoying because you	do three	0.0
You have already done the next one but we do times one third then we will find	Third	3.0
Third	Uh	0.0
X is equal to	Twelve	3.0
Twelve	Humm	0.0
But what do you do here	Er plus seven	3.0
What are you going to find	Er 12 X is equal to seven	3.0
Minus	Well uh	0.0
Minus 19 plus seven	Yeah we must add that yeah well 26	3.0
TssTss	Er 25	3.0
Youve got 19 objects missing someone gives you back seven how many do you have missing	Well er 12	3.0
Then after that what do we do	Times one	3.0
You want to take away the two	Yeah well times a second	3.0
A half	Yeah a half	0.0
Which will give we take away the X X equals	Equals is equal to	0.0
Mental calculation	Yes I know	0.0
Twelve divided by two the minus it stays	Minus six	3.0
Therefore here you must still put X is equal to 12 and here you must put X is equal to minus six	Minus six	3.0
Minus six	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Sir Sir	0.0
What is it	How do we go about for the two	2.0
How do we go about for the two	Because I can do it but in two stages	3.0
We never said one should do only one stage	a half	3.0
a minimalist either	When we put there er we always first try to take away the part er on the right	3.0
To avoid the minuses but one can do it in both cases	Sir	0.0
Yes	There now Ive found for half of X I will multiply by two to find X	3.0
Youve done a multiplication and a subtraction at the same time	Well you said it was	0.0
You want X on its own	Thats the least difficult	0.0
Therefore whats bothering you here	Minus seven	3.0
And then we find two X is equal to	Minus 12	3.0
And now we do one stage where we do times a	Half	3.0
Its what you did its that one	Yeah at D	3.0
Its on the left so whats bothering us	The minus five	3.0
Two X minus 16	Thirteen	3.0
Valentine	So we put the bar and we do minus er minus two X	3.0
So we put the bar and we do minus er minus two X	Times a half	3.0
So why do times a half	To do a	0.0
Were going to write what Herve said then were going to look at how we can complicate a problem which wasnt too complicated to start with	We can	0.0
If I do times a half how many Xs do I have here	Two	3.0
Two X	No half of X	3.0
No	No	0.0
No	Ive got an idea	0.0
Ive got an idea	Times half X	3.0
Do you insist	No	0.0
Therefore for the first we shall say what	We can do	0.0
Because at the moment we say well do minus two X weve decided the Xs will be on the left	Nine	3.0
We can do both at the same time	We can put them one after the other	3.0
So there one can put them one after the other because its two additions	All right	0.0
All right	Are we obliged to do them both at the same time	0.0
because minus two X minus five	Minus one	3.0
Minus	Minus	0.0
Minus	No minus 13	3.0
No minus 13	Minus 18	1.0
Minus 18	But how much is it when one does minus 13 minus five	2.0
But how much is it when one does minus 13 minus five	Minus 18	3.0
Well minus 13 minus five youve got 13 objects missing someone asks you for five more youve got 18 missing	Ha yeah	0.0
Ha yeah	divided by two	3.0
It seems to me I dont know And then after	Divided by a half	3.0
No	Not divided times a half yeah	3.0
X is equal to	Minus nine	3.0
Yes	Er there how do we do it	2.0
No	Its wrong	3.0
Its wrong	Ha yeah nine is wrong	3.0
Ha it was three X actually	Yeah	0.0
Ha yeah	It makes it makes seven	3.0
You write again the object when youve taken away the brackets	Yeah okay	0.0
You do here the thing like this you can say Im doing literal calculation	Yeah	0.0
And then I find four X minus five is equal to six 27 Then now I can work as I did before	Six X over 27	3.0
Six X over 27	but now if we do minus six X to pass it on this side  to minus two	3.0
We have minus yeah	Well then we do minus four X and we pass	3.0
It doesnt matter	Ah yeah but	0.0
What changes for you	Nothing	0.0
But finally as far as efficiency in what well want to do later on to find problems resolve problems it doesnt take us very far	And after we do it like that	0.0
No you cant After what must you do	On that	0.0
And what will we get	Well its minus 32	3.0
Therefore	Times a half	3.0
Thirtytwo over two	Therefore there it makes minus 16	3.0
Minus 16 is equal to X	Ha yeah	0.0
Anyway one writes S equals so whether one has X equals minus 16 or minus 16 equals X	Yeah it doesnt matter	3.0
All right	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Sir	0.0
Sir	Sir	0.0
Sir	One cant have zero X	3.0
No it would be better not to have zero X because then were not well	But because there it gives us zero X if we do minus 17 X	4.0
Well yeah	It takes away each time er	3.0
Wait lets look if youve already taken	Ha yeah it makes	3.0
You do minus 17 X	I do minus 17 only	3.0
Therefore you find two here	Yeah	0.0
You cant do	But its wrong but its not possible	3.0
So its not wrong its that this equation doesnt have a solution	Wah	0.0
Theres something which doesnt work therefore youre going to say X equals the whole	Empty	3.0
Yes but that is the set containing the empty set therefore its no longer empty	Ha ha what does that mean	2.0
Ha ha what does that mean	It means	0.0
The word there that symbol means empty set	So when theres when theres when its impossible I must put only that	3.0
So when theres when theres when its impossible I must put only that	Sir	0.0
Sir	Sir	0.0
Sir	Sir	0.0
Thats right yeah	E I understand very well	0.0
Is there anywhere here where theres a minus five X	Well no but to have X alone	3.0
Is it X which is bothering you	Yeah	0.0
I dont do minus five X	I do minus X	3.0
Yes	Is it possible that equations dont work like that one	0.0
Where are you there	At	0.0
At	Its not possible	0.0
Its not possible	If four X is equal to four X	3.0
No its not possible	So what do we put	2.0
Do something	Well yeah but	0.0
You must do minus four X	Yeah	0.0
Ill come back	Sir	0.0
Yes	Er here what do we do	2.0
You do minus 15	Yeah	0.0
Eleven minus 15	And for E	2.0
And for E	Is it correct here if I put this	2.0
Is it correct here if I put this	the minus four the over four its also here	3.0
Herve said where I divide first then after you have 15 quarters with 11 quarters	Well we must do minus 15	3.0
At the first isolate the X or multiply them by X	There four X er four X	3.0
Well you take away four X	But	0.0
Possible not possible	Impossible	3.0
S equals	Well Q something	3.0
The slash in the middle	Sir	0.0
Sir	Sir	0.0
Sir	After can one do times 15	3.0
So after when you have the four X alone you can do times a quarter	Sir	0.0
Yes	But no Sir	0.0
Im coming Im coming	Is it possible that	0.0
No because if you do plus five X youve got X here but five X here also	Ha yeah	0.0
Ha yeah	Sir	0.0
Sir	Is it right that one	0.0
Is it right that one	That one also	0.0
You havent eliminated your Xs	But no but if I eliminate that one after that one has minus something	4.0
After well do minus something	Is this correct	0.0
No	Why	2.0
Well look at this all together please	Ah	0.0
Ah	No no no	0.0
Therefore you go from minus four X to X I do plus five X right or wrong	Yes	0.0
Yeah so she says to herself Im going to do plus five X then at the same time you do minus 15 all right	Yeah	0.0
So then I write this	copycat	0.0
Who said that copycat	Me	0.0
You also want to do that	Well yeah	0.0
And then youll have five X plus	Minus four	3.0
In a global way whats bothering me	The 15	3.0
So I do only the minus 15 and I find minus four X is equal to	Minus four	3.0
Minus four	Then we do times times a quarter	3.0
Haha	Minus a quarter	3.0
But whats bothering me also	Its the minus	3.0
That one there doesnt bother me	Times minus a quarter	3.0
Therefore I find X equals	One	3.0
There are already enough in here you must not look for others	250	3.0
To do calculations you must take away the brackets	And is that all	2.0
Then after you do the same problem	Sir	0.0
Yes	Can you come and see	0.0
So we will start there I go round like this	Er here there we do times 10 that like after we have no more commas here	3.0
Exactly	is it correct	0.0
I dont know if its correct but	We do plus	3.0
If you take away two X and then youve got two	Yeah but there arent anymore at all	3.0
Minus two pencils how many have you got	No more	3.0
So	It does minus seven X	3.0
Equals	Twentyone	3.0
Youre not going to add this 21 on the same side	After well we do divided by seven X	3.0
No not seven X we want to keep the X	Times  a seventh	3.0
Times minus to take away this minus then a seventh to take away this seven	Ha yeah	0.0
Okay	Hmm	0.0
So here were going to be able well rub out already  with the eraser	Why is it minus two X at the top	2.0
These two X there thats the one we want to take away	Why isnt it the minus seven X	2.0
As we see that theres only Xs already here we will try and put everything this side we choose a side where we want to put the Xs	Hmm	0.0
We can put it the other way round if you wish	But after that this thing we must also do it at 21	3.0
I said everything we do behind this vertical bar here we must do it on both sides	Why does it stay  why	2.0
So it makes X but 21 divided by seven	Er three	3.0
You can rub out what you had here	Ha therefore X becomes minus three	3.0
But yeah simply	And then that one	0.0
You mustnt divide by four	But Sir	0.0
Yes	the minus seven X there	2.0
Well because I did minus two X	Minus five X or minus two X	3.0
I must still go over there behind	The solution must be the solution which is the least it must be more	3.0
Quarter you can put twentyone and a half	Yeah	0.0
Ha yeah Aurore	Er here  we do there we would put minus 21 that doesnt do anything above	3.0
No it would be minus five X minus 21	minus three	3.0
Well yeah	So it still does something	0.0
No Why do you want minus 21	Sir	0.0
Sir	Is this correct	0.0
Is this correct	I had	0.0
I had	I had	0.0
No youve done times times a seventh minus a seventh so the 21 is affected by the times minus a seventh	Is it correct	0.0
Is that correct	Yeah	0.0
How do I eliminate the Xs	Minus two X	3.0
Whats bothering me now	The minus seven	3.0
Therefore times minus one	A seventh	3.0
Which gives us X equals	Minus three	3.0
So how are we going to see that	Its not possible	3.0
Valentine	Because it would need a place for example four X is equal to three X minus one	4.0
Because it would need a place for example four X is equal to three X minus one	Otherwise we cant take away the Xs	1.0
Otherwise we cant take away the Xs	We cant take away one	1.0
Lets see where do we find so	Times four X	3.0
Youre okay that this four X is bothering you	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	We do minus four X	3.0
So we do minus four X	So it does zero equals zero	3.0
Is that possible	No	0.0
If we did it again graphically as we did it here	Its parallel	3.0
Four X the force the the the equation which says G of R of R X goes on four X	It starts from zero	3.0
Here it starts from zero and each time it advances it goes up how much	Four	3.0
Are we okay	Yeah	0.0
Therefore it means I go from where	Minus one	3.0
I go from minus one on there and then each time I advance one I go up four	Well it would do a	0.0
Well it would do a	It is parallel	3.0
Therefore when do they meet each other these two parallel lines	Never	3.0
Thats the function of the right side	Sir	0.0
Yes	Can I go to the bathroom	0.0
Yeah	The first I didnt understand why	2.0
Well then how do we take away a fraction	Well we  another fraction	0.0
If you had only five X what would you do	Well er times a fifth	3.0
Well correct H I K Yeah	Sir	0.0
Hum um we do	Is it correct	0.0
Ive got 949	Sir	0.0
Yes	Come and see	0.0
Of course	minus er minus the X either negative or positive	3.0
Whats bothering you	Well there its to leave it like that	3.0
Here youve got six X here youve got five X youve got X	Yeah	0.0
So you stay on the left and then you take away	Ah yeah so I do minus one	3.0
Minus X yeah you do minus X	Well it does  and then after to do divide by er	3.0
Therefore now	We do plus 10	3.0
To save a little time I wont bring out my overhead like youre usually accustomed to	Dear	0.0
Dear	Thank you	0.0
Every one of you needs a blank sheet of paper	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Ashley can I have a piece of paper	0.0
Just put it right on the table back there	Thank you	0.0
Dont leave without it all right	Oh	0.0
Everybody ready	Yep	0.0
Nick	The slope	3.0
Use the slope with the	Y intercept and X intercept	3.0
Thats probably the way youll probably want to do it right Nick	Yeah	0.0
Robert	Use the um tables	0.0
Nick question	Wheres the oh right here	0.0
That is your result for your group	So everybody has to do one graph right	0.0
What are we going to do	Do we write this on our piece of paper	0.0
Yeah	Oh okay	0.0
All right	Mr Ormsby you know when you put like a one in here would you go like times	0.0
First of all zeros are our favorite number right	Yeah	0.0
Twothirds times zero is what	Zero	3.0
Plus eight is	Eight	3.0
Now because this fraction is a twothirds do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now	Um threes	3.0
That way you dont have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers	Okay	0.0
All right	Mr Ormsby whoohoo	0.0
Mr Ormsby whoohoo	Okay	0.0
Okay	Mister I forgot how to do these again	0.0
Mister I forgot how to do these again	Like how do you do X and Y	2.0
Jenna	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So it was zero one two and	3.0
Ah thats true except because this is a twothirds fraction	You want to pick three as like	3.0
Exactly	Negative three zero and three	3.0
All right	I got six  in the middle	3.0
I got six  in the middle	So zero three six	3.0
So zero three six	I get six	3.0
Right	Okay	0.0
Okay	No thats not true	0.0
Okay were going to put in zero here right	Okay	0.0
Whats twothirds times zero	Zero	3.0
Plus eight is	Eight	3.0
Eight	So three times two is six	4.0
Six	Divided by three is two	4.0
Three is two	Plus eight is	3.0
Eight is	Ten	3.0
Ten	Okay I get it	0.0
Okay I get it	Thank you Mr Ormsby	0.0
Good job	So six times	3.0
So six times	All right so okay this is what I did	0.0
All right so okay this is what I did	I put three negative three zero three and six all right	3.0
Ive never done that before	Well I did that	0.0
Okay	Its easier this way	0.0
Its easier this way	Its easier	0.0
All right if you say so	Anyways I put negative three so I put twothirds and then	3.0
Times negative three	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Negative three goes in the top right	3.0
There you go	So so its a one and a one	3.0
So so its a one and a one	But thats a negative still right	3.0
Thats still a negative there	So its negative two	3.0
So its negative two	So its negative two	1.0
Plus eight is	Six	3.0
Yeah	See I knew that	0.0
Now three I question though	Try a positive three	4.0
Try a positive three	Twothird so three one	3.0
Twothird so three one	Oh	0.0
Okay	One one and then three eight 11	3.0
Wait a minute	Two	3.0
Two	One is	3.0
One is	And five	1.0
Two plus wait a minute no you were timesing it	Oh	0.0
Oh	Its two so	0.0
Its two so	Its 10	3.0
Its 10	Yeah	1.0
And then six is 12	Its six then 10 and 12	3.0
Its six then 10 and 12	Okay	0.0
Yes	All right I just totally forgot um you know how to do the graph	2.0
All right	Okay	0.0
If I put in zero there whats threefifths times zero	Um zero	3.0
Minus 10	Is negative 10	3.0
So now youre going to now try five in there right	Okay	0.0
So if I do three times five thats	Fifteen	3.0
Now remember Im going to divide by the five which gives me	Three	3.0
Minus 10	Negative seven	3.0
I think you got it now	Oh okay	0.0
Finish it up	Mr Ormsby	0.0
All right	Uh how many points do you want us to plot	0.0
Uh how many points do you want us to plot	Three or four	0.0
Obviously how many points do I really need to make a line	Two	3.0
But just to make sure	Three	3.0
Plot at least three points	Okay	0.0
Okay	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Yeah	I made the graph	0.0
Okay	Dont we have to use use graph graph every single one of those	0.0
Make a big coordinate system	Oh	0.0
As a matter of fact Let me give you a fresh one to save you some time	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	All right now I get it	0.0
All right now I get it	All right	0.0
All right	So we have to make one big um	0.0
Use the whole coordinate system that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything	All right	0.0
Okay	Were out of	0.0
Using an X Y table	Yeah	0.0
Or do you want to learn how to use slope and Y intercept	X Y table	0.0
Right	Mm hm	0.0
But because this fraction is a twothirds what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me	Three	3.0
Or zero three six would be good enough right	Yeah	0.0
So you need my help or do you want to try it on your own first	So to input this X do I have to put this number	0.0
You want to do the negative	Yeah	0.0
Now you know Im going to do two times negative three is	Negative six	3.0
Divide by three is	Neg negative two	3.0
Plus eight	Six	3.0
Positive six	Oh	0.0
Ben see what Chris did there	All right	0.0
All right sir it looks like youre being left out here arent you	No	0.0
Okay you understand what theyre doing	Were using slope	3.0
All right	Okay number four	0.0
Oh by the way guys I like how you labeled them like that	Thanks	0.0
X minus nine right	Minus nine okay	0.0
So tell me how you would graph that	I would	0.0
Here we go	I would go negative nine	3.0
I would go negative nine	So one two three four five	3.0
Now thats negative nine for X	Uh huh	0.0
Right	Mm hm	0.0
That negative nine really is my Y intercept	So then	0.0
So then	I go down	3.0
Ah ha	One two three four five six seven eight nine 10	0.0
And now my slope is onefourth	Uh huh	0.0
So that means	One one two three four	0.0
Excellent job	Oh	0.0
All right	times two is six	3.0
times two is six	Negative six	3.0
Negative six	All right this is seven 10 13 and 16 this time	3.0
Okay	Is this right	0.0
Whats your question Brandon	I dont even know how to do this	0.0
I dont even know how to do this	I dont get it	2.0
Shes doing an excellent job here	Oh	0.0
What are you shy or something	No I just asked this guy and he said	0.0
No I just asked this guy and he said	Im trying to do it too	0.0
Im trying to do it too	Im trying to figure this one out	0.0
Im trying to figure this one out	Yeah how do you do this	2.0
All right	Mr Ormsby this is like the same thing as I did that one right	0.0
Mr Ormsby this is like the same thing as I did that one right	That	0.0
Lets take a look here	I mean I know how to do this but I dont know how to do the fractions	2.0
I mean a lot of these tables look great now lets get them plotted here	Okay	0.0
And we can see what it comes out to be	So after we write them all down we plot them on here	3.0
Right	Every single one	0.0
Okay	All right	0.0
Question	I know how to do the regular ones	0.0
I know how to do the regular ones	I dont know how to do the one with fractions	2.0
I dont know how to do the one with fractions	Thats confusing	0.0
Thats confusing	Those are the ones that I have trouble with	0.0
Those are the ones that I have trouble with	Was he Were you listening when Mr Ormsby was saying this	0.0
Sounds like Nick knows what hes doing	No I said that I have trouble on it	0.0
Okay then maybe we ought to go to Ashley	Nah I could	0.0
Okay	So you want put	0.0
What do we got going on here	Were done	0.0
Sir	Well we got done with all the	0.0
Well we got done with all the	We were going to call you but you were talking to them	0.0
Trying to embarrass me here or something	Of course not	0.0
Uh huh	Youre really slow	0.0
Youre really slow	For these ones here	0.0
Youre such a character Nick	For these for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table and were done	3.0
And everybody agr here agrees right	Uh huh	0.0
What number is that one	Uh I think that was five	3.0
Okay I can safely assume that this one must be the four right	That was five	3.0
That was five	Uh	0.0
Which ones the four	This ones two	3.0
Which ones two	Four is this	4.0
Four is this	Four four is negative nine and up one is four	4.0
Four four is negative nine and up one is four	This one	0.0
This one	So that yeah this is four	3.0
Are you sure about that	Yeah	0.0
Because this one	One two three four five six seven eight and nine	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight and nine	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	This is four	3.0
Ah	Right	3.0
Cause right there I cant tell which line youre talking about right	Right	0.0
So both of those look excellent	Six minus	3.0
Number one slope with twothirds starting at eight and this one is seven right	Mm hm	0.0
Thats a positive three X	Oh	0.0
It should be going	Up	3.0
Okay	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Yeah	We dont get number five	2.0
All right first of all you know the Y intercept is what	Negative five	3.0
So put a dot on negative five	One two three four five	0.0
We all agree on that	Yes	1.0
Guess what number is in front of that X	One	3.0
One	A one	1.0
How do I make one a fraction	One over one	3.0
Now remember slope is rise over run right	Mm hm	0.0
So one over one means I rise one and I go across one	There	0.0
So put a three next to that	Okay	0.0
So number them in other words okay	Okay	0.0
So as soon as you get that done which youre almost done you get them numbered just move on to the next set of five	Okay	0.0
All right	Yeah	0.0
All right	So Y is threefifths X negative 10	3.0
You try youre doing negative five right	Yeah	0.0
Three times negative five is negative 15	Negative 15	0.0
Minus 10	Is um negative um seven Oh minus 10	3.0
Negative three and a negative 10	Oh um 13	3.0
So lets change that	Mm hm	0.0
Well negative five is going to be not five but negative	Thirteen	3.0
Get some help from them	Okay	0.0
If I put in zero here what am I going to get	Uh Zero	3.0
Wait a minute whats threefifths times zero	Threefifths times zero	0.0
Minus 10 would be	Ten	3.0
Ten	No	3.0
Zero minus 10 would be	Ten	3.0
Not positive 10	Negative 10	3.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So oh	0.0
Okay	Uh Isnt that uh	0.0
Now its a positive five right	Yeah	0.0
Divided by five is	Three	3.0
Three minus 10	Seven	3.0
Dont forget the negative	Negative seven	3.0
Negative seven	Oh all right	0.0
Thanks for waiting so long	Okay	0.0
All right you want me to just check the answers	Yeah	0.0
For example this is one correct	Yeah	0.0
This one was equation three	Yeah	0.0
So near the end of each of these arrows	Yeah put the number	3.0
Just number them and move on to the next five	Okay	0.0
Okay	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Mr Ormsby	Were on number six	0.0
Were on number six	I got it guys	0.0
I got it guys	I got it	0.0
I got it	Check our answers	0.0
Check our answers	So heres all of number five	0.0
Excellent work	I crossed it out	0.0
I crossed it out	Theres one theres two theres three and theres four and theres five	0.0
Theres one theres two theres three and theres four and theres five	I figured it out	0.0
Excellent	But it theyre having problems on number	0.0
But it theyre having problems on number	Oh there it is	0.0
Oh there it is	I found it	0.0
I found it	I found it	0.0
I found it	I I now I  do	0.0
As a matter of fact I think its time for me to address the whole class	Okay	0.0
Starting on number six	Yep thats what were doing	0.0
Yep thats what were doing	Were starting	0.0
All right	Yep all	0.0
Does that make sense to everybody	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Could you check ours	0.0
Could you check ours	All right	0.0
Yeah	Actually Im on four	0.0
You guys numbered them	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Equation five looks good	I havent even gotten to five	0.0
I havent even gotten to five	Im already	0.0
It looks perfect so far	Okay	0.0
Move on to equation six then	Okay	0.0
On which one	Well theyre obviously on five and	0.0
Okay	Were on	0.0
Youve got the one of the smartest kids in class right here	Hes tried to explain it once but Im not so sure	0.0
You understand what you did there	Yeah	0.0
So you when you put in zero onefourth times zero is what	Zero	3.0
Minus nine is	Negative nine	3.0
Then you tried four right	Yeah	0.0
Numbers like that	Because theyre divisible by four	4.0
Just one	Yeah	0.0
Minus nine is a negative eight	Yeah	0.0
Onefourth of eight is	Two	3.0
Okay	Can I see this really quick	0.0
Can I see this really quick	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Guys	Are you sure this is right	0.0
Are you sure this is right	Because youre all	0.0
Oh so you want me to just check six real quick right	And five	0.0
And five	And five	0.0
And five	Five because thats the one we messed up on	0.0
Five now looks perfect	No three	0.0
No three	Three was	0.0
So three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope which you did perfectly	All right	0.0
Heres six so you started at positive eight	Yeah	0.0
The slope is negative fivethirds so you went down five and over three didnt you	Yeah	0.0
Perfect	All right	0.0
Ashley how is Brandon doing here	Im helping him	0.0
Thats what I want to see	The rest were done	0.0
The rest were done	We just want you to check	0.0
Nick if you want to watch you can	Okeydokey	0.0
But I can tell you right now five is good	Okay	0.0
Okay	And you see the pattern in eight and 10	2.0
And you see the pattern in eight and 10	If I put how many do you add for 10	2.0
Let me check one again	Yeah youve got to do 12	0.0
So first of all our Y intercept is eight	Wait wait	0.0
Ashley lets look at yours since youre more comfortable with yours	Yeah	0.0
You agree that zero eight should be my first point right	Mm hm	0.0
Thats good	Hold on Brandon	0.0
Three	I made one over three	3.0
I made one over three	One two three	0.0
Oh heres your mistake	Yep Jessie	0.0
When I put in three two times the three would be six	Six	0.0
Six	Oh yeah	0.0
Divided by three would make	Two	3.0
Six divided by three is two right	I know its two	0.0
Okay	Eleven	3.0
Eleven	Twelve	1.0
Twelve	This may be 12	1.0
I believe its 12	Yeah see I did it on here but I did it wrong on my paper	3.0
Okay	Its weird	0.0
Two says were starting at what number	Negative 10	3.0
Hey how come we didnt use your table	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	We were looking at his	0.0
We were looking at his	Okay	0.0
Okay	So if we start at 10 then	0.0
You copied the equation down wrong	Thats number four	0.0
My mistake	Oh yeah it does start at six	3.0
That should be a negative 10 right	It looks like a six but its 10	0.0
And five you got negative seven	Yeah	0.0
I agree with that	Yeah	0.0
All right	All right	0.0
All right	Mr Ormsby whoohoo	0.0
Hey how come none of these lines are labeled	Whoops	0.0
Now what I suggest you do	two lines	0.0
Put a number at the end of each of these lines	Oh like number one two three	0.0
I dont like what I see here	Look what you made me do	0.0
Look what you made me do	You probably thought of it wrong	0.0
Number one I believe this is supposed to be your number one here right	I think so	0.0
I think so	I dont know	0.0
How come its going down guys	I dont know it does it	0.0
So all of these should be going up	Hows it going down	2.0
Its going down	Its going up	3.0
How do you read a book sir	Left to right	0.0
So lets start on the left side of the line	Yeah	0.0
And as I move to the right Im going in which direction	Down	3.0
Now if you look at all the other lines see theyre all positive	But its going up	3.0
All right	Its going down like that	3.0
Correct this one at least	How come weve never done this before	0.0
Okay	You made me do it	0.0
You made me do it	Could you check our answers for	0.0
So heres your number six right	Uh huh	0.0
And you started at eight and the slope was negative fivethirds so you went down five and over three	Uh huh	0.0
Lets check number eight real quick	All right I think I did it kinda	0.0
Number nine is 14 which is where	Its all the way up here	3.0
Perfect	Cool	0.0
So now all you guys have to do	Answer the questions	0.0
The best you can	On this piece of paper	0.0
On your piece of paper okay	Okay	0.0
On your own piece of paper	Okay	0.0
All right how we doing here guys	I dont know	0.0
Whats the ruler for	Oh	0.0
Just from now on make sure straighten out these lines and keep going	All right	0.0
Thats number one	Yeah	0.0
Number two	No thats number three	0.0
No thats number three	I forgot to do number two	0.0
You ready	Yeah	0.0
Its three X plus seven right	Yeah	0.0
When I put in zero whats three times zero	Zero	3.0
Plus seven is	Seven	3.0
Whats zero plus seven	Well I started Oh	0.0
All right	I didnt know it was right	0.0
Put away the book	Okay	0.0
Someone must be making a mistake because were getting different answers here right	Mm hm	0.0
I would trust Chris Chris to be honest	All right	0.0
Okay	I used twos  threes	3.0
Now did you have to go by twos	I I dont did I	0.0
Isnt this just a regular number three	Yeah	0.0
All right guys lets see what we can do here	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Mr Ormsby	All right never mind	0.0
Okay	I guess	0.0
Does everything I say make sense so far	Yes Mr Ormsby	0.0
Twelve minutes left in class	Um	0.0
If for whatever reason you actually get to the last page	Yeah we are at there	0.0
Were going to pick up were going to pick this up again on Monday but if you happen to ask these questions	Monday	0.0
Yeah were back on Monday right	Yeah	0.0
At about lets say four or five minutes Im going to make all of you do it anyways	Youre so generous Mr Ormsby	0.0
Lets focus on this	We got done and we  like wheres the paper at	0.0
We got done and we  like wheres the paper at	Right there	0.0
All right Ashley	Yeah um Okay I dont get these two	0.0
Does anyone in this group	No	0.0
Understand what to do here	No	0.0
No	Because like theres different numbers	2.0
Because like theres different numbers	Which one would we use	2.0
Now you want to use slope and Y intercept or do you want to make tables	Tables	0.0
Seems like tables are the way to go here right	Yeah	0.0
First of all Ashley thats a negative fivethirds isnt it	Oh	0.0
Oh	Wait No the fastest	0.0
If I plug in zero whats negative fivethirds times zero	Zero	3.0
Plus eight is	Eight	3.0
That was easy	But I dont know what to use	2.0
But I dont know what to use	Like threes	3.0
Okay	My stomachs hurting	0.0
My stomachs hurting	Can I get a drink of water	0.0
Nick Jessie you ready	Two 10	3.0
If I put in a three there okay	Its going to be five right	3.0
Whats negative five plus eight	Negative Oh yeah	0.0
Positive three	Wait  is negative two	3.0
Wait  is negative two	Wait is that how you do three	0.0
And then the next one is going to be what	Negative two	3.0
You got it	Oh	0.0
two	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	I	0.0
Okay you havent done You did that in your head huh	Yeah	0.0
Impressive	I always do my work in my head	0.0
Thats all	All right	0.0
Why do you keep getting out of your seat Robert	Well I have to	0.0
So whats going on here how we doing	Okay	0.0
Okay	Were doing fine	0.0
So have I come by to check all 10 equations yet	No not yet were just Were on number 10	0.0
No not yet were just Were on number 10	Not all 10	0.0
Not all 10	Just the first five	0.0
Just the first five	Were on number 10	0.0
You want me to wait until you get number 10 done	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
All right	Why did I get it wrong oh I didnt write it	0.0
Whats going on	Well because weve been waiting for you	0.0
Okay all right	For like a century	0.0
Or if youre not stuck what would like me Do you want me to just check your answers then	Yeah	0.0
Is that what youre saying	Yeah	0.0
Yes or no	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
Oh really	Well because youve been over there you know	0.0
All right lets start with six through 10	Well were only on eight	0.0
So Okay so Ill do Ill do the first eight hows that	First eight Okay	0.0
You would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one	Number three	0.0
So that one is perfect	And number three	0.0
See eights a negative onethird	Yeah but thats a plus 12	3.0
You ready	Zero three and six is right though right	3.0
So why did you plot down here when zero positive 12 is up there	Oh I made a mistake	3.0
Okay lets look at the rest of your table	I put a negative	3.0
All right if I put a three here DeCarlos whats onethird of three	Um one	0.0
So that negative makes it a negative one plus 12 which was a positive So you had these points exactly right	I check I put them backwards	3.0
So you put them down you plotted wrong basically right	Yeah	0.0
All right	Mr Ormsby	0.0
Youre finally done right	Yes	0.0
Spotcheck a few of them because Id like you to move on to the questions	Okay	0.0
Okay	All right	0.0
You just finished 10 right	Mm hm	0.0
All right	Thats a lot of questions	0.0
Youre going to have more time on Monday anyway	All right	0.0
When you graphed them what did you honestly notice about them all	They all had a slope	4.0
They all had a slope	They all went to the right	4.0
They all went up and to the right	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Yeah they were positive	3.0
Do this quickwrite for the remaining part of the class	On that same piece of paper	0.0
Did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better	Same paper	0.0
Or Y intercepts	Same paper	0.0
Lets get that done	Can you check these	0.0
Whats this skull and bones stuff	Dont know	0.0
Dont know	Nice drawing	0.0
Oh youre waiting for me because were done over here	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Let me let me see wh Let me see the answers	Theyre over here	0.0

I used Phillies in my other classes but for you Tim I used Eagles	First the Raiders	0.0
Theyre very good by the way in Philadelphia	So are the cheese steaks	0.0
Marcus	N hot over three dollars	3.0
N hot over three dollars	Or	0.0
Not over because that means divided	Three N	3.0
Three N means however many I buy I have to pay three dollars for right	Where do you get the N from	2.0
Jen	Wouldnt that mean you have to multiply them	3.0
So if I got two hotdogs how much money am I spending	Six dollars	3.0
Yes	Can it be like any letter	0.0
Good question	But isnt it confusing	0.0
How much money are you going to make this week Ryan	Fourteen	3.0
Josh	Seventy	3.0
Michelle	Multiplied it by a seven	3.0
Yes	So for the hotdog thing would the N be two	3.0
We substituted two for the N	Oh	0.0
We evaluated that example	Do you have to write that then	0.0
Do you have to write that then	Or can you just write like how like however many dollars it was times two	3.0
This	Do you have to write the N or	0.0
Well normally youll be given that yes	Okay	0.0
Marcus	I guess like four times two	3.0
I guess like four times two	Four times two plus three would be eleven	4.0
And remember if there is nothing in between a number and parenthesis what operation do we do	Multiplication	3.0
Patrick	Multiplication	3.0
Yes	So my answer to the question is four times two is eight plus three is	3.0
Is 11	All right	0.0
Social Studies class is three times as long as math	It is	0.0
Because math class is fun Tim	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	Oh I get it	0.0
Oh I get it	I just like math	0.0
Theyre all the same but that was just an	I thought fifth period was the longest	0.0
I thought fifth period was the longest	Yeah	0.0
Take numbers and change them into words	You can do one of those	0.0
Im gonna give you an some examples	Wait	0.0
Patrick	A plus negative three	3.0
Im going to give you another Yes	Whyd you put the parenthesis around negative three	2.0
If I put	Oh	0.0
Andrea	Do you have to put it down there	0.0
Tim	Would it make a difference if we put it around N plus or not	2.0
Marcus	What if you switched it around  negative three before	2.0
Before N	Yeah	0.0
But its but Its backwards here from what the words are	Oh	0.0
Yes	So a number means like you put a letter	3.0
Any letter	So that means oh	0.0
Michelle	Six minus N	3.0
Six minus N	N minus six	3.0
Why do you think that	Oh because	0.0
Tell me why	Six is less than the number	3.0
Six less than a number	Oh	0.0
Alex	So then when it says less than in like a question you always minus the number from the letter	3.0
So then when it says less than in like a question you always minus the number from the letter	Like go the letter minus the number	3.0
Yes	Who did do you have to put the parenthesis around the minus six or would that be considered a negative six	2.0
So Im going to give you this time Yes	Is this in the book too	0.0
Jen	K over eight	3.0
Thats Steve	K into eight	3.0
That would be eight into K	Oh	0.0
Christy	K of eight	3.0
What does of mean in that	Oh	0.0
Fifteen minus B Patrick	Fifteen less than B	3.0
Fifteen less than B	Or less B less than 15	3.0
Andrea	What does quotient mean	2.0
Alex	Uh says sub well take Substitute words and change them into numbers	3.0
Do you remember back what order of operations means Jen	PEMDAS	3.0
Whats that mean	Parenthesis exponent multiplication division and addition and subtraction	3.0
And whats the saying that goes along with that	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
Jen	Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally	3.0
Aubrey whats please mean	Oh parenthesis	3.0
Whats that mean	Exponent	3.0
My	Multiplication	3.0
Dear	Division	3.0
Aunt	Addition	3.0
Sally	Subtraction	3.0
Patrick	You do the multiplication first	4.0
You do the multiplication first	But put the you put 12 in for N and then you do the multiplication and then you add	4.0
Alex	Or you could substitute N for 12 and put quotations around	3.0
Parenthesis	Yeah parenthesis around N 12 so you know how to do those first	3.0
Jen	What about for us in the example that says uh a number plus a negative three	4.0
What about for us in the example that says uh a number plus a negative three	Wouldnt you have to do something with those parenthesis though cause thats the order of operations	4.0
Marcus	I have a question	2.0
I have a question	Is that one point five	0.0
So Patrick said put 12 N for N Class whats two times 12	Twentyfour	3.0
Plus one point five gives us twentyfive point five	Is this all in our notes	0.0
Yes Brandon	Yes	0.0
Michelle	Write a variable expression for each quantity	0.0
Write a variable expression for each quantity	Explain what the variable represents	0.0
Steve	Like N N minus negative six	3.0
No just N minus six	N minus six	3.0
What does N represent	Her moms height	0.0
Patrick	Uh C times three	3.0
Or how else could you say that	Three times C	3.0
Andrea	Three C	3.0
Ryan	Three X	3.0
Think think about that one again	Plus X	3.0
So what would it be	Three plus X	3.0
Whats X represent	Jill	0.0
Alex	N two	3.0
Or how could we say that	Two N	3.0
Quotient of three divided by W Marcus	W over three	3.0
W over three	Or three over W	3.0
Michelle	N minus 17	3.0
Im going to pass out your homework	Oh do we on our homework uh	0.0
Patrick	When youre trying to figure out all the problems	0.0
Marcus	Uh	0.0
Steve	When youre trying to figure out like how much something weighs	3.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
How about Yes Patrick	Very good	3.0
Jen	When youre trying to find the price of clothes or something	3.0
Yes	Like in science like when you try try to find density	3.0
Andrea	Page 64 from workbook Xerox copy numbers one to 22 do all of them	0.0
Page 64 from workbook Xerox copy numbers one to 22 do all of them	And a quiz on Friday	0.0
Yes	For number one through 16 you dont have to write the answer	0.0
It doesnt say evaluate	Oh yeah	0.0
Yeah just write the expression	Theres an extra	0.0
Brandon	On uh on number one do you have to have do you have to put the number before you uh subtraction	0.0
So like	So it would be like five subtract uh any number you any letter you want to	3.0
Yes	On number two it says the absolute value do you have to put the lines in	0.0
What do you think	Yes	0.0
Yes	But do you like put an N	3.0
Yes	For number five do you have to put two expressions because it says uh says three more than the product	4.0
What would the product of eight and a number be	So wouldnt it be like X	3.0
Okay	So What should I use	2.0
Please John please work	So then eight and equals	3.0
Eight No plus	Plus	0.0
Because thats three more than	Okay	0.0
Marcus	I have a question on like number three	2.0
Josh whats your question	How do you solve this	2.0
What does product mean	Multiplication	3.0
Okay so how would you do that	Uh	0.0
Uh	I dont know	0.0
What are you multiplying here	Negative eight	3.0
And	A number	3.0
Okay so how would we do that	Negative eight N	3.0
Good	All right	0.0
Very good	Whats the answer	2.0
Yes	All right I have no clue what to put first	2.0
What does product mean	Like the answer to a number	3.0
What kind of operation are we using for product	Multiplication	3.0
So what are we multiplying here	Uh negative eight	3.0
And	Negative eight and P And the product of	3.0
Well	So is it negative eight	3.0
Times	P So negative	3.0
Alex do you have a question	sum of the quarters	3.0
Okay	It would be	0.0
How much is a quarter	Twentyfive cents	3.0
So how do we represent that in numbers	Point twentyfive	3.0
Okay	So it would be N 25 or	3.0
Point two five N	Okay	0.0
Brandon	Yes	0.0
Yes	Right here	0.0
Right here	So if its five less than a number would it be five subtract X	3.0
X is the number so it has to be the other way	Oh	0.0
Oh	So it up here it would be 15 more than how do I So it would be X plus 15	3.0
Just make sure you put it in absolute value of the box	Oh so thats good	0.0
Oh so thats good	So fifteens got to be in the box	3.0
Yeah no the number does	What number	2.0
Any va any variable that you use	Oh so it would be uh the box then X then plus 15	3.0
Yes	And then down	0.0

That yeah that can work the same for you	Its on	0.0
Its on	You got no homework	0.0
I gueStudents I better put the lights back on	MiStudents  I have a	0.0
What	My homework	0.0
Okay get your aStudentsignment and go ahead and put it away for now	Oh my gosh	0.0
Oh my gosh	The next aStudentsignment	0.0
Okay	MiStudents  are we Do we need paper	0.0
Yes	Do you have some paper	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Yes Austin	Do you want us to put our folders up  put it in	0.0
I will give you a sheet that were gonna work on today that you can take notes on	Okay	0.0
The only thing you need on your desk is this piece of paper Im gonna give you and a pencil	Do we need a calculator	0.0
No	Want our book	0.0
Send that five to that other group back there	I forgot my book at home	0.0
I forgot my book at home	Im a bad girl	0.0
Okay	Where do I sit	0.0
Where do I sit	Right there	0.0
Right there	Right there	0.0
You didnt get one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	He has one	0.0
He has one	Yeah	0.0
Now two to the fourth is how much	Sixteen	3.0
Sixteen	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Thats	0.0
So two to the fifth would be how much	Twentyfive	3.0
Twentyfive	Twentyfive	1.0
Twentyfive	No	1.0
No	Twenty	3.0
Twenty	Thirtytwo	1.0
Well we know that	Thirtytwo	3.0
Two to the fourth is 16	Thirtytwo	3.0
And we take that and multiply it by two and we get	Thirtytwo	3.0
Look at the growth	Its very big	3.0
We found that two to the one was two	Two	0.0
Two to the two was four	Four	0.0
Two to the three was	Eight	3.0
And two to the fourth was	Sixteen	3.0
What do you think that graphs gonna look like	It a curve	3.0
Yes	Become a parabola if you go to the negative side	3.0
If we think about this what does two squared mean	Two times two	3.0
And what does two cubed mean	Two times two times two	3.0
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	3.0
What would this equal	Two to the fifth power	3.0
Well	You have to multiply it by	3.0
You have to multiply it by	You have to do	0.0
Two to the third power times two to the	Third power	3.0
We have because its squared	What	2.0
What	Oh squared	3.0
Yes Lucia	Is is that the same thing as doing two to the third power and then just like getting the answer	3.0
Right	Mmhm	0.0
Two	Times two	3.0
Two times two times two	Two times two times two	0.0
And what do we get here if I write it as a final power	Two to the sixth power	3.0
Now for the last example whats being squared here	The X	3.0
The X	One X	1.0
One X	The two	1.0
The two	Two X	1.0
Two and X or just	Two	3.0
Two	Two	1.0
Two	Two	1.0
This is	Two X	3.0
Two X	Two X	1.0
Two times X times two times	X	3.0
Right	Oh	0.0
Is that any different	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
And this is two squared times	X squared	3.0
X squared	X squared	1.0
Okay	Oh	0.0
Expand those out like I did on the board please	Can I  by expanding	3.0
Can I  by expanding	Right	1.0
Good	Okay	0.0
And then give us the final answer	So you want us to just tree branch off and just	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Yes Brett	Just asking am I doing it right	0.0
Just asking am I doing it right	Is that right	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
DiscuStudents it with your group	Do we do you want us to do our rule thing too	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	I already know what	0.0
I already know what	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	3.0
Dont you like add the little exponents together to get	No	1.0
No	Otherwise you just	0.0
Otherwise you just	No	1.0
No	Youre not	0.0
Okay	Well yeah that too but what did you guys get for the rule	2.0
Did you come up with a rule	You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	3.0
You just add all the exponents and if theres a letter	I I understand	0.0
If you say youre gonna add exponents how would you write that	A plus N equals equals	3.0
Whats your base in this problem	A	3.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Did I do this right	0.0
Very good	You would say add the exponents	3.0
You would say add the exponents	The exponents to	1.0
The exponents to	Add the exponents to find your base	1.0
So youre just saying that youre gonna yeah	To find your base exponent	3.0
To find your base exponent	Or how would you say add the add the exponents	2.0
Or how would you say add the add the exponents	How would you what would you call it	2.0
Add the exponents is sufficient	Add the exponents	0.0
Mmhm	So you have to add the exponents	3.0
So then show me that	you know how to spell it right	0.0
Robert what did you find out	What oh I was gonna ask you a question	0.0
Ask the question	Do we have to write it in words	0.0
You can you can do it in symbols Robert	Okay	0.0
Okay	In that case we are	0.0
If I A to the M times A to the N what did we find out when we multiplied	A to the M plus N	3.0
What did you get Chad	A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	3.0
A to the N in the parentheses and then N on the outside of the parentheses	No thats not right	1.0
No thats not right	No	1.0
So then you found so how would I do it if I had A to the two to the four	You would A to the sixth	3.0
You would A to the sixth	So you just add it	0.0
What does parentheses stand for in math	Multiplication	3.0
So would someone seeing this say oh multiplication or addition do you think	Multiplication	3.0
Multiplication	Multiplication	1.0
How can I show it such that its being added	What Robert says	1.0
So are yes Austin	I got A and then 27	3.0
On which problem	On the rule	0.0
On the rule	For the rule	0.0
Okay	I said N is A to N to the A B Cs is 13	4.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
Cause if you look at the first problem we had A square times A to the fourth and we got A to the	Sixth	3.0
And two plus four is	Six	3.0
Six	Six	1.0
And whats the exponent on A	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
So two plus one is	Three	3.0
For number two	Yeah	0.0
So three plus one plus four is	Eight	3.0
Cause when you expand it youll be able to see the pattern much more quickly	Okay	0.0
Okay	Three A two two	3.0
Three A two two	MiStudents	0.0
Yes	When you do this three you break that	3.0
Whats in the inside part	The two A squared	3.0
And how many times would you have A squared	Three oh three times	3.0
Three oh three times	Oh three times	1.0
So write that out	you would break it down and right	3.0
Can you break that down even further now	I did	0.0
Whats A squared look like	A times A	3.0
And then you have to have how many sets of those	A multiplied by A	3.0
A multiplied by A	Three	1.0
Three	Three	1.0
Three	Three	1.0
So then you write that out and youve expanded it	Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	4.0
Itd be A by A by A by A by A by A	So it would be A to the sixth	4.0
So how many As would you have	Six	3.0
A to the	So it would be A to the	3.0
So make sure you expand it out	Thats	0.0
Thats	Thats what I got	0.0
Lucia did you have a question	Oh I get it	0.0
Oh I get it	I get it	0.0
I get it	No I was asking the same thing as she did but I heard you explain it	0.0
Whats that	How you Im gonna just write it three times write this three times	0.0
Right	Yeah so	0.0
Then how do you break out for your A squared	Two As	3.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
So how many As do you end up with	A to the sixth	3.0
A to the sixth	Six	1.0
A to the sixth	So then itll be A to the sixth	3.0
So then itll be A to the sixth	He got A to the fifth	1.0
He got A to the fifth	How did you all get six As	2.0
How did you all get six As	I got five As	3.0
I got five As	Because two times three is six	4.0
Did you do okay	And thats  six	3.0
Show him	So see you do	0.0
Explain to Chad how that works	Here	0.0
Here	If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	4.0
If theres three its A squared times three so you have to do three A squared then you have to break it down to A times A	cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	4.0
cause thats what A squared is and then you do that for each of them and thats three A squared with	So basically I iStudentt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	3.0
So basically I iStudentt the rule like you just times whatevers in here	The number by that	3.0
So youre gonna multiply your exponents right	Yeah	0.0
Did you guys have it	So you multiplied the two and three and got six	4.0
So you multiplied the two and three and got six	Yep	0.0
Yep	Yeah	0.0
You have your rule	Oh	0.0
Dont forget to do your rule if you have determined it with your group	All right	0.0
Yes	Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	3.0
Can we sh we  that it was multiplying	Can we show it anyway we want	0.0
Thats thats exactly yes	Hi	0.0
Hi	Im on TV	0.0
Yes	How do you do this one	2.0
How do you do this one	It said like	0.0
It said like	So on number five we	0.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
And how many times do you need A squared	Three	3.0
Dont you need three A squares	This one	0.0
Dont look at that bottom part	Oh	0.0
What does that look like	IStudentt it She says that like Didnt you do it this way	0.0
No	Thats what	0.0
What whats being cubed here	Three	3.0
Whats being cubed here	Oh	0.0
Whats in the parentheses	Three twos	3.0
So write three A twos for me	Three A twos	3.0
Three A twos	Oh	0.0
Cause iStudentt that dont you have A squared three times	Oh I get it	0.0
Write three A twos out	Three A twos	0.0
IStudentt this A two A squared times A squared times A squared	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	So this is wrong	0.0
So this is wrong	You have A squared A squared like that	3.0
Now can you break those down further	So its A six	3.0
You guys okay with the same logic and see if you see a pattern	Okay Mrs Scott	0.0
Yes	Its A to the sixth power	3.0
Its A to the sixth power	I dont understand that	2.0
I dont understand that	I dont	0.0
Whats A cubed look like	That I dont know	0.0
How many As is it	Three	3.0
So write A times A times A	Okay	0.0
So what do you write	Another	0.0
Another	Where did you get another	2.0
I was just reading your paper	Oh well	0.0
Thats right	Oh	0.0
Break it out	Oh we have to keep going	0.0
Oh we have to keep going	So we cant just stop right there	0.0
So how many As do you have	Well how what about the two	2.0
Well how what about the two	Where did we get the two from	2.0
A to the three	Yeah	0.0
So A three times A three is that	Oh twice	3.0
Oh twice	Huh	2.0
So how many As do you have	Six	3.0
Okay	Do we really have to break them down the whole way	0.0
Lets go	Yeah	0.0
I just want to know what the answer to number four is	A to the sixth	3.0
Now what did you get over here Phoebe for number five	A to the sixth	3.0
And Roberts group what did you get for number six	A to the eighth	3.0
Did someone find a rule	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
Chris what did you find out	A to the M times N or A to the MN	3.0
When we have an exponent within parentheses raised to an exponent we get A to the what	A to the M times N or A to the MN	3.0
Right	Mmhm	0.0
Then well let them know cause Ive I already got	MiStudents	0.0
MiStudents	And then A five times A five	3.0
And then A five times A five	And then A four times A four	1.0
Okay	You just put the exponent after the number	3.0
Okay	So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	4.0
So if we did this Could A three times A three will be the same as A B three	Right	0.0
Write that down what you said you think it is	What	2.0
Right	A A A times B B B	3.0
So you asked me is it the same as what	A B	3.0
A B	Okay	0.0
Okay	So it would be A B times A B times A B	3.0
So it would be A B times A B times A B	Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	0.0
Wanna ask her like how do you combine it	How do you combine it	2.0
Okay	Those arent the same	3.0
How many As do I have	Three and three	3.0
It is	No	0.0
That says to me A times B times B times B	A three B three	3.0
Cause this is when you asked me	Right	0.0
Right	I told you	0.0
Yes	So this would be right and	0.0
Try to develop your rule if you can too with your group	How do you keep You just combine them	3.0
How do you keep You just combine them	Right	0.0
Is that the problem I gave you	No	0.0
I dont see you writing this out in expanded form	All right	0.0
Yes	Am I doing this right	0.0
Yes	Oh	0.0
Oh	MiStudents	0.0
Yes	I told you brat	0.0
I told you brat	I dont understand the next step	2.0
I dont understand the next step	Okay	0.0
Okay	So far I  A times B so thatd be A B	3.0
Okay	And then its times three	3.0
Yeah	So A times A B A B A B	3.0
So A times A B A B A B	What do I do next	2.0
So how many As do you have	Three As and three Bs	3.0
Three As and three Bs	Three As	1.0
Three As	And three Bs	1.0
That says one A and three Bs	Is this right	0.0
Is this right	Oh	0.0
Oh	One A and three Bs	3.0
DoeStudentt that what that says	Where	0.0
A to the one times B to the three	Thats not what I have	3.0
Thats not what I have	I have this	3.0
I have this	Oh what	2.0
Oh what	Is it A cubed	3.0
Is it A cubed	Well would it be like	0.0
How many As do you have	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
So whats whats	A	3.0
A	Cubed	1.0
Cubed	A cubed times	1.0
A cubed times	A cubed times A cubed	1.0
A cubed times A cubed	And thats thats	0.0
And thats thats	So then I was right	0.0
Yeah	Oh	0.0
Oh	Cool	0.0
Cool	So A B times to the third iStudentt right	3.0
So A B times to the third iStudentt right	Would it be  or would it be times that	2.0
Would it be  or would it be times that	Is that right Ms Scott	0.0
Thats thats fine	A cubed times B cubed	3.0
Uhhuh	So A cubed times	3.0
Cant it	Sure	0.0
Yes Phoebe	Okay	0.0
Okay	I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	4.0
I dont okay for number seven wouldnt it equal like wouldnt you put in for instance A times A times A	and then other times youd put it B times B times B	4.0
How many As do you have	A or A cubed	3.0
Times what	Times B cubed	3.0
Times B cubed	So would that be the answer or would I put A B cubed	2.0
Write A B cubed for me	Five times and then times B times B times B	3.0
How many As is that	Three	3.0
Wheres the three on the A	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	So youd have to put A cubed plus B cubed	3.0
Are we did I tell you to plus	No	0.0
What are we doing	Times	3.0
Times	Multiplying	1.0
And how do we designate multiplying in algebra	Parentheses	3.0
And what other way	And the little dot thing	3.0
And what other way	Times the X	3.0
Times the X	The X	1.0
And what other way	I dont know	0.0
Well if I write A B what does that mean	A times B	3.0
So you can just have them next to each other right	Yeah	0.0
And that still means multiplication	And then would I put like A B cubed or A cubed and B cubed	2.0
Yep	What	2.0
What	A cubed and B cubed	2.0
A cubed and B cubed	Is that what I would do	0.0
Uhhuh	Like	0.0
Like	I mean B cubed	3.0
I mean B cubed	Is that what I would put	0.0
Uhhuh	Thats the answer	3.0
Thats the answer	Thats how I would get it	0.0
See the other ones	So we put it in parentheses	3.0
So we put it in parentheses	Oh that doeStudentt help	0.0
Robert how would we rewrite that	A B Cubed	3.0
Right	Mmhm	0.0
And on eight Courtney the quantity A B to the fifth power	A to the fifth times B to the fifth	3.0
A B	Its A to the fourth and B to the fourth	3.0
Did someone find the rule	We did	0.0
Blake	Its A to M times B to M	3.0
What is two over two equal to	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
And what is two over two equal to	One	3.0
So what are we left with	Two	3.0
Were left with one square which is what	Four	3.0
Four	One squared	1.0
One right	One yeah	0.0
Right	So	0.0
So	So	0.0
So	What do we do with the one	2.0
Shh	Multiply it	3.0
Right	Thats all you write	0.0
This is saying I have four over two how many times	Three	3.0
So how many fours do I have	Three	3.0
And how many twos do I have	Three	3.0
Three	Oh thats pretty easy	0.0
Okay	Thats all we have to do	0.0
Section four problems 10 through 12	Oh my gosh	0.0
Oh my gosh	I feel so stupid	0.0
I feel so stupid	How does this one look	0.0
How does this one look	For section	0.0
Thats wrong	IStudentt it A	3.0
Right	Mmhm	0.0
How many As do you have left	Four	3.0
And he wrote three	Oh	0.0
Oh	I wrote three too	1.0
So how many As would be left	Two	3.0
Two	Three	1.0
Three	Two	1.0
Two	Three cause right there	1.0
Three cause right there	Two	1.0
Two	One two three	1.0
Yeah	Three	3.0
Three	Yeah cause theres three	1.0
See if you come up with a rule on that one	A to the fourth power	3.0
A to the fourth power	How do we do  like that	0.0
Yes Tiffany	I dont understand how to do that one	2.0
So how many As do I need to write out here	Four six	3.0
Four six	Six	1.0
So write out A six As	Okay	0.0
Okay	This is Cynthia	0.0
This is Cynthia	Uhhuh	0.0
Uhhuh	Did you get A to third	0.0
Did you get A to third	A to the fourth	3.0
A to the fourth	Right	0.0
And whats it being divided by	A to the second	3.0
And then how many As are you gonna write	Two	3.0
Two	Two	1.0
Now A over A becomes what	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
And A over A becomes what	One	3.0
And how many As do you have left	Four	3.0
Four	Four	1.0
Okay	So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	3.0
So wouldnt it be A to the fourth	So its two A squared	3.0
Whats one times one	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	3.0
A to the fourth	A fourth	1.0
A fourth	A fourth	1.0
A fourth	So then its just A to the fourth	1.0
So then its just A to the fourth	He was the smart one	0.0
And A times	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay I got it	0.0
Yes	Would you add these together the four and the four	3.0
Whats the denominator	Oh	0.0
How many As are supposed to be down there	Okay	0.0
Okay	Is this right MiStudents Scott	0.0
Is this right MiStudents Scott	Did you do A to the sixth and A to the	0.0
Okay	Is this A to the fourth	0.0
Whats left here	I still dont get how its down by four	2.0
A over A	One	3.0
And whats this	One	3.0
And whats this	Four	3.0
Whats one times one	One	3.0
And whats one times A to the fourth	A to the fourth	3.0
A to the fourth	Oh I got the rule now	0.0
Oh I got the rule now	Okay	0.0
You get Does that make sense to you	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	MiStudents Scott is this right	0.0
MiStudents Scott is this right	Did you get A to the sixth on top and then A	3.0
Yep	And then	0.0
Yep	Does the answer equal A to the	3.0
Does the answer equal A to the	And this ones A	3.0
And this ones A	Right	0.0
Right	Cause	0.0
Lets look at problem	You just add them	3.0
You just add them	You just add them	1.0
Dominic what did you get for the answer to problem number 10	A to the fourth	3.0
Sam on number 11 what answer did you get	A to the third	3.0
Chelsea what did you get	A	3.0
Lucia	A to the M minus N	3.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
So go ahead and do 13 through 15 quickly	Oh	0.0
Yes	I need help	0.0
I need help	How do you get it	0.0
How do you get it	Oh yes I do	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So first you expand it out right	3.0
So first you expand it out right	You get A times A times A over B times B times B	4.0
You get A times A times A over B times B times B	So wouldnt it equal A over B	4.0
So wouldnt it equal A over B	I dont know	0.0
Well how many As do you have	Three	3.0
So how do you write that	Oh so it wouldnt be A cubed over B cubed	3.0
Try the next one and see if you see a pattern develop	A times	3.0
A times	That was really really	0.0
That was really really	B times B	3.0
B times B	So now what would that equal	2.0
So now what would that equal	Zero or would it just equal A	2.0
Zero or would it just equal A	Yeah	0.0
Yes	MiStudents Scott am I doing this right	0.0
MiStudents Scott am I doing this right	MiStudents Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	2.0
MiStudents Scott on number 13 would it be A over B or would it just be zero	Cause they all	0.0
Okay	To three	3.0
To three	Three	1.0
So its A over	Third	3.0
Third	So itd be right	0.0
Okay	But those both canc the thirds cancel out so itd just be A over B	4.0
They do	Couldnt it be one	3.0
How do you know that	I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	4.0
I dont know because theyre theyre both to the third power	Because	0.0
But whats to the third power	But you dont know	0.0
A	A and B	3.0
A and B	So its still So theyre different	3.0
So its still So theyre different	So its just A over B	3.0
Are they like terms	Nnhnh	0.0
So can we combine unlike terms	Nnhnh	0.0
Right	Okay	0.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
Okay	So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	2.0
So what was the last answer if theyre in simplest form	Its A to the third B to the third	3.0
Its A to the third B to the third	Why	2.0
Why	But MiStudents Scott did you say	0.0
But MiStudents Scott did you say	Couldnt that still be A over B though	3.0
Couldnt that still be A over B though	Ms Scott	0.0
Yes Im listening Lucia	You said it was  like this is all one	0.0
You said it was  like this is all one	Didnt you because	0.0
So So how many As do you have	Three	3.0
Three	Oh	0.0
What would I have	Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	3.0
Then that would cancel out and it would be these here	Right	0.0
Right	Or no	0.0
Or no	Cause theyre both	0.0
Whats A What Whats Whats A over A	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	It would still be	0.0
It would still be	A over	3.0
Whats A over A equal	One	3.0
If I had three of those what would I have	Three	3.0
Three	One	1.0
Well whats one times one times one	A to the third	3.0
A to the third	One	1.0
One	Oh	0.0
Oh	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
One	One yeah	1.0
One yeah	One	1.0
One	Three	1.0
So if if the denominator was the same variable as the numerator yes we could simplify it	Mhhm	0.0
Right	Mmhm	0.0
What is our answer Robert	A to the third over B to the third	3.0
Number 14 Austin	A over the A to the five over B to the five	3.0
And number 15 Rachelle	A to the sixth and B over B to the six	3.0
Cristie	A M	3.0
And I want you to prove that A to the negative N is equal to one over A to the N	This is math homework for tonight	0.0
Youll present it to me tomorrow in claStudents	What if we dont know	0.0
What if we dont know	Do we have to	0.0
Do we have to	Are you serious	0.0
So start working on that	All right	0.0
Do you need me Robert	If A equals one over	3.0
If A equals one over	I dont get that	2.0
I dont get that	A equals zero is another one right	3.0
A equals zero is another one right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So youre gonna keep plugging A in	3.0
So youre gonna keep plugging A in	Oh no because lookit	0.0
Oh no because lookit	A to the zero is A to the zero	3.0
A to the zero is A to the zero	So if you dont	0.0
So if you dont	If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	4.0
If you plug in a number its still A cause theres no one	Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	2.0
Nuhuh cause if you plug in a number then what if the A equals six	Yes	0.0
Yes	See yes were right	0.0
See yes were right	Okay	0.0
Okay	I can do A minus  right	3.0
Yes	You you have the question	0.0
You you have the question	Okay no	0.0
Okay no	Okay well it would this be okay	0.0
Okay well it would this be okay	You know zero times everything is zero right	3.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	3.0
But if A equals one then then One times zero is zero	Like never mind	0.0
Like never mind	Youre not making much sense	0.0
Youre not making much sense	Never mind	0.0
Never mind	Ryan made it sound better	0.0
Ryan made it sound better	I always	0.0
Work out some sample problems and see if you can come out and prove to me why A to the zero is one	A Because A is one	4.0
Think about using those rules	That like just went right over my head	3.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay guys	0.0
Okay guys	He says that A zero plus N equals one	1.0
He says that A zero plus N equals one	Thats not right	1.0
Thats not right	What	2.0
What	IStudentt that zero not one	3.0
A to the zero power equals one	Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	3.0
Zero A to the zero but then it would still be zero	Wouldnt it be zero	1.0
Wouldnt it be zero	UnleStudents you can	0.0
UnleStudents you can	Because anything times zero is zero	4.0
Because anything times zero is zero	Right	0.0
Right	But we have to prove to her why its one	0.0
But we have to prove to her why its one	UnleStudents you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	4.0
UnleStudents you have zero over one and then you reciprocolated it	Its not one though	3.0
Its not one though	Reciprocolated it	0.0
Reciprocolated it	Thatll still be zero	3.0
Okay	I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	4.0
I dont get how it could be one though cause anything times zero is zero	Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	0.0
Is gonna be something that I can  myself and	So then how could it be one	2.0
So then how could it be one	Divide by zero	3.0
If you took variables dont do numbers	MAB	3.0
What do we know about the rule of one	How are we gonna do these	2.0
How are we gonna do these	A by negative	3.0
You have a question	We never learned these	0.0
We never learned these	The negative ones	0.0
The negative ones	Remember	0.0
Remember	We never learned these	0.0
Yes	Hi	0.0
Hi	Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	3.0
Since Well why do you have to multiply cause you didnt have to multiply it	Right	0.0
Right	So it would just be one	3.0
What if A was a million	Huh	0.0
Huh	A million	3.0
Lets say our A was equal to a million	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	Cause it would be equal to six	3.0
Cause it would be equal to six	Huh	2.0
Huh	A million and one	3.0
A million and one	Equals six	3.0
Equals six	How do you	0.0
And they So six to the zero power is one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And any	0.0
And any	How	2.0
How	Cause anything is one	4.0
How	But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	4.0
But if it says like like when you multiply something by zero it says youre not doing anything to the	Like if you had six times zero it says that youre not multiplying anything  zero	4.0
But were dealing were dealing with powers now	Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	0.0
Yeah I know but I dont I dont see how it could make anything different	So itd be A times C	3.0
So itd be A times C	Oh I know	0.0
Oh I know	Cause its only one of these	0.0
Cause its only one of these	Thats what I was trying to say	0.0
Thats what I was trying to say	Is that it	0.0
Is that it	Its only one A because there	3.0
Youre getting youre on the right track	Cause its only one	4.0
Cause its only one	Its not	1.0
Start thinking about it in terms of multiplication and division now	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
Yes	I really dont get this	2.0
I really dont get this	Instead of even if you you were like	0.0
Instead of even if you you were like	Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	4.0
Like what What if there was like one One times zero that would be zero right	If it if like	0.0
If it if like	Cause if  A were a number	0.0
Cause if  A were a number	Cause if any number multiplied by zero is zero right	4.0
That its being multiplied	It says A to the  power	3.0
It says A to the  power	So	0.0
So	So	0.0
Does A to the zero mean A times zero	No	0.0
What does it mean	A would have to be one then right	3.0
Cause I can tell you that a million to the zero power is one	Oh	0.0
Oh	So A times A times itself to	3.0
Ten thousand to the zero power is one	What	2.0
What	Over Oh	0.0
Start thinking about it	Cause these have to be A theyre A right	4.0
Cause these have to be A theyre A right	Cause itll be one over	4.0
Cause itll be one over	Itll just be	0.0
Itll just be	The first one were having a hard time understanding	2.0
Now think about what you can use over there between your multiplication and your division rules and prove to me that A to the zero is one	Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	0.0
Well we thought we had it and then we werent sure	Well what did what did you do	0.0
Lets see	We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	4.0
We thought that if A equaled one then it would be true	Cause then	0.0
And Im telling you that if A is equal to 100 its true	Yeah but why	2.0
Using your rules up there	Oh okay	0.0
How am I gonna get that zero power and itll start making sense to you	Okay	0.0
Okay	Cause he kept saying this is impoStudentsible cause wouldnt it be zero equals A	1.0
Cause whats two to the one power	Two	3.0
Two	Two	1.0
Whats two to the second power	Four	3.0
And how did you do that	I multiplied two by itself	3.0
So here this is not saying A times zero this is say A to the zero power	Told you	0.0
A to the zero power	That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	4.0
That means youre not timesing it by anything so it stays A	So that would be one right	4.0
What if A was equal to 1000	Then itd be A to I dont know	3.0
No cause a thousand to the zero power is	Is	0.0
What can I do mathematically to get A to zero power	Mathematically A to the zero power	3.0
Mhhm	Oh you plus plus N	3.0
Oh you plus plus N	Can we use the calculator	0.0
Yeah you could use a calculator	Okay	0.0
You could use a calculator	Okay	0.0
Okay	So so the second	0.0
Put in 1000 to the zero power	Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	4.0
Oh cause youre just timesing it by nothing right	So it would be one right	3.0
So it would be one right	Or you just get it	0.0
Or you just get it	How do you get zero equals one	2.0
Okay	Okay I dont get it	2.0
Well	Maybe you divide it by one or something so that would be	3.0
Look at your rules of exponents up there and where do you think you can get a negative N	Oh A times M over A times N equals A M minus N	3.0
So therefore M would have to be larger than N Right	Yeah	0.0
Think about it	We dont understand this	2.0
Now Ryan I figured youd have this solved in no time	I I I cant work with them	0.0
I I I cant work with them	Work with us	0.0
Work with us	Its weird	0.0
Its weird	We dont under	0.0
We dont under	I remember learning this a long time ago	0.0
I remember learning this a long time ago	Like it was one of those questions	0.0
Like it was one of those questions	It was like one of those brain stumpers	0.0
It was like one of those brain stumpers	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And	0.0
Right	And we can divide	3.0
And we can divide	Yeah	1.0
What kind of problem could you give me	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	A multiplication problem	3.0
With exponents	With exponents	0.0
With exponents	With exponents	0.0
With exponents	A to the one	3.0
A to the one	Yeah	1.0
A to the one and then what would I have to do to A to the one so that it becomes A to the zero	Divide it	3.0
Divide it	Minus it	1.0
divided by what	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
By one or by	Zero	3.0
Now since were doing division what does the rules of exponents say	Oh you have to minus right	3.0
So it says that what youre going to do to get this and we want this put this equal A to the zero	To equal	3.0
What whats whats one of the rules	You have to minus minus	3.0
You have to minus minus	You subtract the	1.0
You subtract the top exponent from the bottom	Yes	0.0
So how am I going to what am I gonna put down here such that this would be zero when Im done	One A	3.0
One A	A to the one	1.0
A to the one	Okay	3.0
Now is A to the one over A to the one equal to A to the zero	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	0.0
By your rules what do you do	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You subtract	3.0
You subtract	Cause you subtract	1.0
Now what do you know about math when a number is over itself	They cancel out	3.0
And what does it equal	Zero	3.0
Zero	One	1.0
One	One	1.0
One	One	1.0
What does A divided by A equal	One	3.0
So now if we do this division what answer do we have here	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
And whats that equal to	Zero	3.0
What does that say	A to the zero	3.0
And what is that equal to	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
Now didnt you just prove it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So how do you write that out	2.0
So how do you write that out	Oh	0.0
Oh	I	0.0
I	Can we just show that	0.0
Can we just show that	All right	0.0
All right	Thats it	0.0
Thats it	Thats real easy	0.0
Okay	All right	0.0
All right	Okay	0.0
Now was it as hard as you thought	Yep	0.0
Yep	Sure	0.0
Sure	Easy	0.0
You guys we need to wrap it up	Shh	0.0
Okay	Do we have homework tonight	0.0
You have homework tonight	Oh	0.0
See ya	The first one	0.0
The first one	Bye Mrs Scott	0.0
Bye Mrs Scott	I love you	0.0
I love you	Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	0.0
Youre the best teacher in the whole wide world	We think youre the bomb	0.0
Are you ready	No	0.0
If you need to sharpen your pencil you better do that right this second	homework	0.0
That was the only other thing that I asked you to do	I heard a couple of things	0.0
I thought you were going to be the star of my show	Im definitely the star	0.0
Suzy	If an angles inscribed in a circle and it intercepts part of the circle then the angles measure is equal to half of the other angle	4.0
Matt	If an inscribed angle intercepts a semicircle then the angle is a right angle	4.0
If it intercepts a semicircle then angle turns out to be	Right angle	3.0
And arc intercept corollary Margaret	When you have two inscribed angles and they intercept the same arc	3.0
When they intercept the same arc then they have the same	Measure	3.0
Michaela	Ninety degrees	3.0
Why do you say 90 degrees	Because it says that secant and tangent angle is a right angle and it	4.0
So and the measure of a semicircle here arc A V is what	A hundred and eighty degrees	3.0
Whats that	The right angle corollary	3.0
Leah	Because its the central angle and the central and the arc that they intercept equals the measure	4.0
Go ahead	Triangle A P V is isosceles so angle three and angle two have to be congruent	4.0
Okay	And since all angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees you take 180	4.0
And since all angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees you take 180	You subtract 120 and you divide them into 65	4.0
Youre on a roll lets go	Yeah P V C has to be a right angle because it intercepts V C	4.0
They say radius to that tangent we learned that	Oh yeah	0.0
Go ahead	If A V C is 90 degrees and angle two is 30 degrees	3.0
This kind of this being 60 degrees how does that relate to back here the arc	Half	3.0
So the measure of an acute secant tangent angle with its vertex on the circle is	Half	3.0
What do you think this general statement here measure of arc A V if its X whats angle one gonna be	X	3.0
Suzy	You first have to do 180 minus X  and then you divide it by two	4.0
Divide it by two	Then theyll be the same as three	3.0
Thats going to be	Ninety degrees	3.0
And so the last here this angle is going to be what	Half of the arc	3.0
Which is	Half X	3.0
Melissa	Full circle has to equal 360 degrees take away the 200	3.0
How do you get that one	Um the triangle	3.0
Triangle um	Serum theorem	3.0
Serum theorem	It has to be equal to 180	3.0
Equal 180 so	If angle one is already 160 then angle two and angle three are equal	4.0
Anything different about that one than the other example	No	0.0
If youre following a pattern what are you getting	Half	3.0
Its gonna be	Half	3.0
For measure of angle A V C how would you relate that back to X for any for any measure	X over two	3.0
How would you figure out angle one if you know X for A X V	Three sixty minus X	3.0
And Katie how would you do that last one that angle two	Angle two would be	0.0
This ones a little bit tricky	The 180 thing works like I know how to explain it Im not sure exactly what the equation is but I could do it	3.0
Okay	Like I	0.0
So tell me what to do and well try to put it in X for you	All right	0.0
All right	You have to get the measure of angle A P V	3.0
Okay	And then	0.0
Thats 360 minus X	Yeah	0.0
Okay	And then you would take the other two since its an isosceles triangle and	4.0
And then you would take the other two since its an isosceles triangle and	have to be equal so you have divide whatever the original angle is	4.0
have to be equal so you have divide whatever the original angle is	Like it I dont know	0.0
Like it I dont know	Im sorry	0.0
Im sorry	You subtract A P V from 180 and then divide it by two	3.0
You subtract A P V from 180 and then divide it by two	Thats what I would do anyway	0.0
Minus measure of angle one and then you take that and divide it by two	Two	0.0
It could be a chord and a tangent youre gonna come up with what	Nine	3.0
Its always gonna come up to be	Half	3.0
Leah	Arc A C equals 160 and angle one is an inscribed angle so its half of A C	4.0
Good	And since A C is 160 half is 80	4.0
Melissa	B D is 40  so angle of that so its half	4.0
Michaela	Theres two ways you can get it	3.0
Theres two ways you can get it	The first way is to add the measures of angle one and angle two together	4.0
The first way is to add the measures of angle one and angle two together	And the second way is to add the measure of the two arcs together and divide it by two	4.0
Or do you want to just do the next row and see what we come up with	Yeah	0.0
If A C is 180 what does that angle one have to be	Ninety	3.0
Inscribed angle	Thirtyfive	3.0
What would that give us	One twentyfive	3.0
If we do 180 plus 70 what does that give us	Two fifty	3.0
Two fifty	Divide that	3.0
Divide that in half you get	One twentyfive	3.0
What do you think	First angle is half the A C	3.0
What Matt says	That for measure of angle one has to be half of the arc A C	3.0
How about measure of angle two has to be half of	B D	3.0
Katie	What if you added the two angles together at the top and that was whatever that is if its the triangle	4.0
What if you added the two angles together at the top and that was whatever that is if its the triangle	You get that other measure and then its an 80 degree thing	4.0
You get that other measure and then its an 80 degree thing	See if you subtract that from 180	4.0
See if you subtract that from 180	Like	0.0
Say that again	And then its on the 180 degrees line cause thats where the line is	4.0
Okay	All right	0.0
All right	That you add the two angles at the top and subtract that from one that from 180 because it makes a triangle	4.0
That you add the two angles at the top and subtract that from one that from 180 because it makes a triangle	So you subtract that from 180 and that gives you what the other angle is	4.0
Youre talking about A V C or D V B	A V C The first one	3.0
A V C The first one	And it works for the other one too	3.0
Is that a lot to do for a general rule	Maybe but it works	3.0
So now we have maybe three different ways to find it	But that actually that actually proves that what Michaela said works	1.0
But that actually that actually proves that what Michaela said works	Cause	0.0
She did two	Both of them	3.0
Both of them	Well both of them	1.0
It proves that both of them work	Both of them got the same thing	1.0
Both of them got the same thing	Both of them got the same answer as the other one that Katie just said and that really proves it	1.0
The 125 and the 100 that we already went over	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Because basically just adding angle one and angle two together is simplifying adding A C and B D B D together and divide it by two	4.0
Because basically just adding angle one and angle two together is simplifying adding A C and B D B D together and divide it by two	Cause if you do 180	0.0
Okay	You do 180 minus 125 you get 55	4.0
You do 180 minus 125 you get 55	Well then if you do 180 minus 55 you get 125 again	4.0
Okay	Its longer but it proves it	3.0
We have three different ways which one would fit into there	Half the sum of the two arcs	3.0
Melissa	intercepted arc of for angle of B D has to be half	3.0
Go ahead	The same reason as for measured angle	3.0
Ben	You can do first you gotta do 180 minus one and that gives you the measure of B C D	4.0
You can do first you gotta do 180 minus one and that gives you the measure of B C D	And then you do that plus adding the two and then subtract that from 181 and then you have A V C	4.0
So you were going with that whole large triangle	Yeah	0.0
That leaves you with 80	Eighty	0.0
You have 80 you have measure of angle two which is	Twenty	3.0
So that gives you 100 so that angle V A V C has to be	Eighty	3.0
That works	Or you can do A C is the  outside the angle is outside the circle	3.0
The arc	A V C	3.0
Angle A V C	Its outside there but it intercepts A C The arc A C	3.0
Okay	The arcs 40 degrees and since angle A V C is 80 maybe its 40 times times two	4.0
No	It also intercepts arc B D	3.0
Okay	But if you do B D which equals 200 plus A C  240	4.0
Mmhm	At no wait	0.0
At no wait	Do 200 minus 40 and then you get 160	4.0
Okay	Divide that by two and that equals 80	4.0
If youve been following this pattern of the angle it turns out to be	Half	3.0
Okay	I see	0.0
Read that theorem for me and fill in the blanks	The measure of an angle formed by two secants that intersect the exterior of a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs	0.0
The	Difference	3.0
Were subtracting them this time	I thought I said that	0.0
I was trying to see if Raul would get that	I thought that angle one was 100 degrees	3.0
I thought that angle one was 100 degrees	Right	0.0
Okay	And then in order to find A B C you had oh yes	2.0
Thats a little like youre taking youre doing it but youre taking an extra step	Mmhm	0.0
How did you get your answer there	I used a theorem	3.0
What did you do	I just used that theorem	3.0
How did you use it	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	I did something	0.0
You did something	All right	0.0
Either way you do it you gotta show me what you did	Ms Lancour should we solve it	0.0
You all did it the exact same way as Leah did it	Yep	0.0
That one was the nice one	I like nice ones	0.0
Not me	Now I dont have to show my work	0.0
The R S U	Yes	0.0
R S U looks like the vertex is on the circle	Yes	0.0
Raul what are you doing over here	Well I dont have any	0.0
Which angle are you doing first	Well I dont I havent  problem but Im doing U T before  anything else	0.0
Well I dont I havent  problem but Im doing U T before  anything else	Makes it simple for me	0.0
Why is that	Cause then I feel like the question would be R S U	4.0
Cause then I feel like the question would be R S U	Theres R S U Oh that would be half of that	4.0
Theres R S U Oh that would be half of that	that	0.0
Youre finding this arc first	Yeah this one first	3.0
Howd you get this one Melissa	That it intercepts arc R U so it has to be half	4.0
What did you do	Since the points on the circle I just divided the arc by two	4.0
Because the R S U the point is on the circle	Yeah	0.0
So it has to be	Half of the arc	3.0
Good	Where is	0.0
Where are you Margaret	Right here	0.0
Okay you started to subtract	Well	0.0
You changing your mind	No	0.0
You got 110	Divide it in half	3.0
Divide it in half	No	1.0
No	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	No	1.0
Yes	Maybe	0.0
U S V U S V How did you get that one Leah	Cause R S U is half of 140 so its 70	4.0
Cause R S U is half of 140 so its 70	And thats a line  equals 180	3.0
And thats a line  equals 180	One eighty minus 70 equals 110	4.0
Tell me what you just did again	This angle R S U is 70	3.0
Okay	Thats half of that	3.0
Okay	And this equals 180 so 180 minus 70 is 110	4.0
At first at at first I thought you were doing the triangle	No	0.0
But you ended up doing 180 degrees	Cause the line equals	4.0
Minus	Yeah	0.0
Margaret go for it	You do 140 degrees	3.0
Okay	Minus 30 degrees and you get 110	4.0
Minus 30 degrees and you get 110	So you divide that in half and get 55 degrees	4.0
Michaela	I used the triangle sum theorem	3.0
Okay	And we just did R V U so I know that that is 55 degrees	4.0
Okay	And since S U V	0.0
This one	I used the oh whats it called	2.0
I used the oh whats it called	The arc intercept theorem	3.0
Okay	To find out that that was 15	3.0
So so far we have 55 and 15	I added them together and I got 70 so I did 180 minus	4.0
It didnt even occur to me	Angle R S U we already figured that  70	3.0
We did this RSU which was 70	Because if the R equals 140 and then R line segment R S V	4.0
Okay	that line the the angle of it equals 180	3.0
It has to be 180	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And so you do 180 minus 70	4.0
And so you do 180 minus 70	You get 110	4.0
And she got 110	Thats the easy way	0.0
How would you get that one	Ninetyfive	3.0
You say	Ninetyfive	3.0
Ninetyfive	triangle sum again	3.0
You did triangle sum	I did triangle sum	3.0
I did triangle sum	I did was to figure out what arc U T equals	3.0
I did was to figure out what arc U T equals	It equals 90	3.0
It equals 90	You do 100 plus 90 divided by two	4.0
Tomorrow	Tomorrow	0.0
Tomorrow	Tomorrows the what	0.0
Well Good Morning	Good Morning	0.0
Do you know what country the city of Oslo is in	Norway	0.0
Thats quite a long distance isnt it	Yes	0.0
Graham your hand was  up first do you want to tell our visitor what happened	Well we had a candy bar	0.0
Well we had a candy bar	Tuesday	0.0
Tuesday	And then We had  to make a problem and use our rods to see who got more and by  how much	0.0
Mark	Well the people that got one fourth got more by fivethirtysixths	3.0
Can you kind of remember it in your head without the rods  how that worked James	Umm Well we had to  thirty six whites  And it took five whites to  get from onefourth to oneninth one ninth or one ninth to one  fourth so five thirtysixths to get is the answer	4.0
I  asked you	Umhum	0.0
Brian	Well its the same well me and Meredith kind of thought that it  was the same as nine minus four equals five	4.0
So you were thinking whole numbers	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Meredith	Well if you put the blue which has nine ones in it and the four  plus the five rod then you have nine	4.0
You said if you took the blue and what number name are you  giving that	Well Id call it nine	3.0
Youre going to give it nine and what was the other rod	The four rod which I think was the purple rod	3.0
Is that what you said	Yes and then the yellow would be the five and it would equal up to  it	3.0
Yes and then the yellow would be the five and it would equal up to  it	That is what I thought at first	0.0
That is what I thought at first	I think that	0.0
Erik did you want to say  something	I think that it doesnt make sense because how could the blue rod  be one ninth of one model and the purple rod be one fourth when  the blue rod is larger than the purple rod	4.0
I think that it doesnt make sense because how could the blue rod  be one ninth of one model and the purple rod be one fourth when  the blue rod is larger than the purple rod	Maybe If you made a  super gigantic train than maybe the blue rod would the nine but I  would think that the purple rod more sensibly the purple rod or the  yellow rod would probably be the nines and the blue rods would be  the fourths	4.0
I heard Meredith call the blue rods	Yeah I know I just dont think the way Meredith explained the way  she thought before made a lot of sense	0.0
Yeah I know I just dont think the way Meredith explained the way  she thought before made a lot of sense	I know I changed my answer	0.0
I know I changed my answer	I just think the five rod equals up to the same as five thirtysixths	3.0
So you think that the five thirtysixths is somehow related	Umhum	0.0
Is that  right	Yeah	0.0
That was very interesting so I was just wondering when  you saw the big model that was built and you saw that the person  that got one quarter of the candy bar got five thirtysixths more  than the person who got the ninth of the candy bar is that much of  a difference do you think	No I think that there is twentyfive people in the SS and that is  an odd number so so umm you cannot have all even groups that is  why I think some people got one ninth and one fourth	4.0
Think about a way think about that  Andrew any ideas	Well what I did one day we had to do for homework that we had  to divide equally so I came up with the answer that everyone got  one and one fifth	4.0
How did you do that	Well there were three candy bars and each one had ten rectangles  in it	4.0
Well there were three candy bars and each one had ten rectangles  in it	So I took twenty five of them and circled it and put one	4.0
So I took twenty five of them and circled it and put one	Then  the five left if you divided them up into fives it would be five ten  fifteen twenty twenty five so each person would get one and one  fifth	4.0
Andrew how did you show that	Yeah well I made the three candy bars	3.0
Can you all imagine that	Ummhum	0.0
Ummhum	Then I took two candy bars and five pieces of the other one to  make twenty five	4.0
Okay so everyone gets one of those thirty pieces and there are how  many left over	Five	3.0
Okay	Then those five would be just like one candy bar but it would be  smaller so you divide them into fifths five ten fifteen twenty  twentyfive	4.0
Then those five would be just like one candy bar but it would be  smaller so you divide them into fifths five ten fifteen twenty  twentyfive	There are enough people so everyone get one and one  fifth	4.0
Danielle	Less	3.0
Why	Because thats  a bigger number so when you have a bigger  number you get less	4.0
Which is the bigger number	Five	3.0
What do you think	Well I agree with her	1.0
Well I agree with her	If you have a bigger number than you need  to take like say see its  one and one fifth	4.0
If you have a bigger number than you need  to take like say see its  one and one fifth	If it is one fifth then  there has to be five of them in one whole	4.0
If it is one fifth then  there has to be five of them in one whole	And If there is one  fourth And If they are  quarters then you only need four of them  to go into one whole so five is a bigger number and so it needs  more to fill up one whole	4.0
And If there is one  fourth And If they are  quarters then you only need four of them  to go into one whole so five is a bigger number and so it needs  more to fill up one whole	So its so its less	4.0
David what do you think	Well I think  that like if you have about this big then one half  would be right in the middle then  one third that would be kind of smaller  because you have to fit three pieces in there  and then one fourth would be even smaller than onethird	4.0
Call something one and draw it	Umm Maybe umm the orange	0.0
Just sketch it  Sure	Umm like If this is the one here	0.0
Can you mark one half right where you put it like put it right  underneath so we can see it	What do you mean	2.0
Put one half where you want to  show one half	One half Then one third	3.0
One half Then one third	Then one fourth	3.0
Where do  you think one fifth would be Meredith	The whole would be divided into fifths	3.0
So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter or to the left of  a quarter	Left	3.0
Approximate is okay Erik	Approximate	0.0
Do  you agree	No	1.0
What do you disagree with	The one third approximately needs to be a little more over because  the one fourth  has to be half of the one half	4.0
The one third approximately needs to be a little more over because  the one fourth  has to be half of the one half	So if you put one  fourth half of that  it would be on the left  of the one third	4.0
So if you put one  fourth half of that  it would be on the left  of the one third	I know	0.0
I know	I didnt I didnt put the one third	4.0
I didnt I didnt put the one third	The one third if it was  one fourth it probably be about here right	4.0
The one third if it was  one fourth it probably be about here right	So its not its just  approximate cause I dont think	4.0
Now do you agree with all this Andrew	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Should I call on someone to place one fifth	0.0
Ok Im going to ask you all one onehundredth What do you  think	I disagree	3.0
Why	Well if one fifth is next to the end	4.0
Well if one fifth is next to the end	Then five plus five equals up  to ten so it would be like in the half	4.0
James	I think it should go more towards zero	3.0
Alan	I think that the one tenth should be moved over just a tiny bit	3.0
Its getting hard to do this isnt it	Yeah Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into tenths  and you have a half mark	4.0
Yeah Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into tenths  and you have a half mark	So you have to use this as a guideline  youd have five tenths on one side and five tenths on the other side	4.0
So you have to use this as a guideline  youd have five tenths on one side and five tenths on the other side	Now up there if you took that little space between the zero and the  one fifth and you  use that five times it wouldnt reach the half  way mark	4.0
Brian	I agree with Mark	1.0
I agree with Mark	It is a little far back	4.0
It is a little far back	I think the third should be  moved up then the fourth should be moved up	4.0
I think the third should be  moved up then the fourth should be moved up	Because that why I  thought the fifth was wrong when I did it because everything was  moved back	4.0
How many thinking  about the number lines	Wow thats very good	0.0
Wow thats very good	See  Mrs Phillips	0.0
I think Michael was first so we will let him go first	Why do you have like you have for your half you have one half and one half	2.0
Why do you have like you have for your half you have one half and one half	I  am not arguing that	0.0
I  am not arguing that	But in your third number line you put two thirds as your  half and then two fourths then three fifthsI see the half but it is not exactly the  half way then I think the three fifths are either too small or too big	2.0
But in your third number line you put two thirds as your  half and then two fourths then three fifthsI see the half but it is not exactly the  half way then I think the three fifths are either too small or too big	The two  fourths are fine	2.0
The two  fourths are fine	The halves are fine	2.0
The halves are fine	It is the two thirds and three fifths	2.0
It is the two thirds and three fifths	Why  are you calling two thirds one half	2.0
Why  are you calling two thirds one half	Because it is not half	2.0
Because it is not half	It is bigger than one  half two thirds is bigger than one half	2.0
It is bigger than one  half two thirds is bigger than one half	We did that once	0.0
We did that once	I know it	0.0
I know it	I just didnt know where to put it	0.0
I just didnt know where to put it	Well this is what the bottom is	4.0
Well this is what the bottom is	This is one third	4.0
This is one third	This is two thirds	4.0
This is two thirds	This area right here is one third	4.0
This area right here is one third	This area right here is two thirds	4.0
This area right here is two thirds	This area is three thirds	4.0
This area is three thirds	You have one third two thirds and then three thirds	1.0
You have one third two thirds and then three thirds	One third two thirds three thirds	1.0
One third two thirds three thirds	This is the area in the middle	3.0
This is the area in the middle	But two thirds is not the area in the middle because two thirds is not equal to  half	4.0
But two thirds is not the area in the middle because two thirds is not equal to  half	This is two thirds	3.0
This is two thirds	Then why did you put it there	2.0
Then why did you put it there	I have	0.0
I have	Why did you put it right under the half	2.0
Why did you put it right under the half	See this is the one third area so I put it therethis is the two thirds area  so put it there	3.0
See this is the one third area so I put it therethis is the two thirds area  so put it there	No Meredith what you did where you think is the one thirds area and you put it  under the line and in the one thirds area	1.0
No Meredith what you did where you think is the one thirds area and you put it  under the line and in the one thirds area	It does not make sense	2.0
It does not make sense	Which one is it	2.0
Which one is it	It is the bottom one	3.0
It is the bottom one	Then why did you put it in the area	2.0
Then why did you put it in the area	Because I wanted to show the one thirds two thirds and three thirds area	4.0
Because I wanted to show the one thirds two thirds and three thirds area	Yeah but they are in the wrong space	4.0
Yeah but they are in the wrong space	If you wanted to do that you should put it  in the exact space or at least approximate	4.0
Well I think her spaces are here Erik	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I know but	0.0
What I am hearing her say is pretend you dont see these	Oh I get it	0.0
Oh I get it	She is just labeling the spaces like one third of a space and that is  two thirds and three thirds	1.0
What do you think Amy	Ohm	0.0
Thank you Meredith	My question was why didnt she just make one big one and not make like five	2.0
My question was why didnt she just make one big one and not make like five	It just doesnt make sense because you do not need  to have  them there and a lot of people will think that they are the numbers and it is  confusing	2.0
Do you have any trouble   with that	No	0.0
It that what you did Meredith	Yes	0.0
That is what I imagined you did	She is making smaller parts of it	1.0
Why do you think she is doing that	It is just easier to see when making the whole number line  over	3.0
It is just easier to see when making the whole number line  over	It is just easier to see	3.0
Can you see  that	Yes	0.0
I got the feeling that the second one you were showing halves and the third  number line what were you trying to show	Thirds	3.0
And the fourth one	Fourths	3.0
The fifth one	Fifths	3.0
Erik you were going to say something	Well see if someone was to look at this for the first time on the third number  line for the first time I know when I did I got confused because I thought that in  the middle of the section where she put the one third two thirds and three thirds	4.0
Well see if someone was to look at this for the first time on the third number  line for the first time I know when I did I got confused because I thought that in  the middle of the section where she put the one third two thirds and three thirds	I thought that that is where they would be	4.0
I thought that that is where they would be	So thats why	4.0
So thats why	I think that is what  Michael did too	1.0
I think that is what  Michael did too	So that is why he asked the question	1.0
Jessica	I think what Erik means is that he thought Meredith was making a whole new  number line like she thought two thirds was the half	1.0
I think what Erik means is that he thought Meredith was making a whole new  number line like she thought two thirds was the half	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It looks confusing	0.0
But that was not what she was doing was she	No	1.0
Alan what were you going to say	The way I thought when you divide it up into fractions then you have a line  going to the fraction but Meredith just put the fractions above the number line  without the line so that meant she was labeling the area	4.0
Okay now in the particular region over here she has two thirds in this region see  where I am pointing	Yes	0.0
Between the one third and the two thirds in that region represent two thirds of the  line	It represent one third	3.0
OK it represents one third How do you know that	Because the way you said that one segment	4.0
Because the way you said that one segment	Well if you use  both those segments like the segment here to here that would be two thirds but  you said the segment here	4.0
Well if you use  both those segments like the segment here to here that would be two thirds but  you said the segment here	It would be the two thirds the segment but it would  be only one segment	4.0
Could you show me what represents two thirds what part of that line represents  two thirds	Right to there	3.0
Right to there	That would represent two thirds	3.0
What do you think	That is true	1.0
How many of you agree with that	Right but what I think   Meredith was trying  to do was you see how it had one third and the one third being here	1.0
Right but what I think   Meredith was trying  to do was you see how it had one third and the one third being here	She was  saying that she was labeling this to be the second third of   the line and labeling this to be the third third of the line	1.0
She was  saying that she was labeling this to be the second third of   the line and labeling this to be the third third of the line	Alg	0.0
Okay so where would you put three over three where would you write that  number if you were to write it on the number line	You are doing it the way Eriks talking about it you would   put one third over that area and you would put two thirds in   that area and three thirds in that area because this would be  representing one third   both of those would be two thirds and   three of those would be three thirds	4.0
I see over here the  numbers zero  one third two thirds and one  Where would you put three thirds	If you put three thirds you would put it just in that big area because it would be	4.0
If you put three thirds you would put it just in that big area because it would be	No you wouldnt	1.0
No you wouldnt	It would be right  there	3.0
It would be right  there	Right that would be the mark of the three third  but all three of those are the  three thirds	4.0
Right that would be the mark of the three third  but all three of those are the  three thirds	Meredith is saying right here that three thirds is right here she says that is one  three thirds in her perspective would be right here	1.0
Meredith is saying right here that three thirds is right here she says that is one  three thirds in her perspective would be right here	No	1.0
Let us hear what Meredith has to say	But	0.0
Let us hear what Meredith has to say	As I did over here I am saying this area here is three thirds	3.0
As I did over here I am saying this area here is three thirds	I know but if someone were to look at this for the one time they would think  that would be one whole and that would be three thirds because you did not  label	4.0
I know but if someone were to look at this for the one time they would think  that would be one whole and that would be three thirds because you did not  label	You should label one whole and under it put three thirds	4.0
But I did hear Meredith say that this piece is three thirds did you mean that Meredith	Yeah this whole entire piece right here	3.0
You mean that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And another thing Alan said	0.0
And another thing Alan said	Well that is why I said	0.0
Well that is why I said	I agree that would be the first piece	4.0
I agree that would be the first piece	That is the second piece	4.0
That is the second piece	But together they make twothirds	4.0
And what makes three thirds	Entire thing	3.0
Entire thing	Three thirds would be the entire thing it would go right  here if this is the third one third segment	4.0
Three thirds would be the entire thing it would go right  here if this is the third one third segment	Right that is just representing the threethirds	1.0
Right that is just representing the threethirds	Thats what I was talking about Alan I am talking about one section is one third  one section is two thirds like what Meredith said they are separate when you put  them together they are two thirds	4.0
Brian	I know what Meredith is trying to say	1.0
I know what Meredith is trying to say	She is trying to say to label between  it because if someone said if someone looks at it and they did not know a  thing about a number line they would probably think that the one third would be  between the one third and two thirds that is why she labeled it also in the middle  because if someone saw it and did not know what a number line was they would  probably think one third is between the one third mark and the two third mark so  she is just labeling it in the middle to make it less confusing	4.0
Ok Amy and Jakki you were going to say something	and  Jakki	0.0
You have a comment yes Mark	I agree with Bryan because if no one ever saw a  number line they would think that this was one third  and this was two thirds	4.0
Alan	We could do that so that we could represent one half two thirds and   three thirds in pieces	3.0
We could do that so that we could represent one half two thirds and   three thirds in pieces	Here is one way to  do it	3.0
Here is one way to  do it	Now here would be one mark two marks	4.0
Now here would be one mark two marks	Now you could  could take out one of those pieces and say it is one third	4.0
What about zero	Zero would be put here	3.0
Michael why	Because	0.0
Ok  Meredith go ahead	You asked me where to place one	0.0
You asked me where to place one	I think if you have thirds one third two  thirds three thirds three thirds would be equal to one	4.0
I think if you have thirds one third two  thirds three thirds three thirds would be equal to one	See because one third  two thirds  and three thirds    three thirds is the same as saying one	4.0
See because one third  two thirds  and three thirds    three thirds is the same as saying one	Four fourths is the same as saying one	4.0
Four fourths is the same as saying one	A hundred hundredths is the same thing as saying one	4.0
Michael	I think that if you have a number with the same number on top as in the bottom  then it is always going to be equal to the number named one	4.0
Jessica you are making a face are you confused	I think yeah I agree with her	1.0
Alan do you have a comment	No what I was saying before when I was talking is that zero to the  one third  mark is one third	4.0
No what I was saying before when I was talking is that zero to the  one third  mark is one third	zero to the two thirds mark is two thirds	4.0
zero to the two thirds mark is two thirds	Zero to the three  thirds mark is three thirds	4.0
Zero to the three  thirds mark is three thirds	Now three thirds you cannot have any more thirds or  you would have four thirds	4.0
Now three thirds you cannot have any more thirds or  you would have four thirds	Then you have to make the thirds bigger or not have  another	4.0
Then you have to make the thirds bigger or not have  another	You can only have three thirds	4.0
Let us hold that question about what would happen if we had  four thirds	You only have four thirds if you are going to have that you could only have four  fourths not four thirds you can have four thirds	4.0
I wonder if we could have four  thirds if we went further	Then we would have to have six thirds	3.0
Meredith just said I  want to make sure you are all able to hear what she just said I believe she said  that you cannot have four thirds in this interval but I asked the question   if you  extend the interval could have four thirds	If you made it to two you would have six thirds and then you could place four  thirds	4.0
Bryan what did you have to say	Alan thinks that I am placing four thirds and I am not	1.0
Alan thinks that I am placing four thirds and I am not	Because you see I think  that you would start on the negative side	4.0
Because you see I think  that you would start on the negative side	Like umm     For example you would probably start on the one third and right  between the one third   and the two thirds would be one third right   between the two thirds and the three thirds   would be two thirds and you see he thinks that when I add that there he thinks  that zero to one third is a fraction it is not	4.0
Like umm     For example you would probably start on the one third and right  between the one third   and the two thirds would be one third right   between the two thirds and the three thirds   would be two thirds and you see he thinks that when I add that there he thinks  that zero to one third is a fraction it is not	Because zero is a separate number  and it is not a fraction and so I would think that if you start on the one third and  anything pass that if you keep going up you would hit two thirds and anything  between there would be one third	4.0
Because zero is a separate number  and it is not a fraction and so I would think that if you start on the one third and  anything pass that if you keep going up you would hit two thirds and anything  between there would be one third	But if you start at zero and you go across and  you hit the one third zero is not a fraction so if you add one more zero between  one third is not a fraction so it would be four thirds	4.0
Some people have written zero as zero thirds	Okay	0.0
Okay	What I was saying before is this	0.0
Very interesting what Meredith is doing up there	Okay	0.0
Okay	What I am saying is that zero to the one third mark anything from zero to  one third is the one third	3.0
What I am saying is that zero to the one third mark anything from zero to  one third is the one third	Now anything pass the one third mark we would be  calling one third zero	3.0
Now anything pass the one third mark we would be  calling one third zero	See one third is higher than zero	3.0
See one third is higher than zero	Right	1.0
Right	So you would not count zero to one third as one third	4.0
You want to say something else Alan	What I am saying is	0.0
What I am saying is	Here is a model of using thirds	3.0
Here is a model of using thirds	Suppose that end is zero and that end is one	3.0
Suppose that end is zero and that end is one	You are saying from there to there this piece really has no fraction value in  the one third	1.0
You are saying from there to there this piece really has no fraction value in  the one third	There is no fraction value	1.0
There is no fraction value	You cannot put that over there look is has extra room	4.0
You cannot put that over there look is has extra room	You only have three  spaces one two three you have one third from zero to one third two thirds  from one third to two thirds and three thirds area from two thirds to three thirds	4.0
Meredith what is your  comment	Well I put one third two thirds and then three thirds would equal one	4.0
Well I put one third two thirds and then three thirds would equal one	And  then I went from zero to two it would be one and one third  two and   two thirds  and then one and three thirds	4.0
One and two thirds right	There is no fraction value between zero and one third because	3.0
There is no fraction value between zero and one third because	If you have no value between zero and one third then look you   eliminate that how many spaces would you have	1.0
If you have no value between zero and one third then look you   eliminate that how many spaces would you have	Two	3.0
Two	What I would think would be that if you start on the lower number  and then keep going up and until you hit that	4.0
What I would think would be that if you start on the lower number  and then keep going up and until you hit that	Anything between there would be the one third and the two thirds right   there	4.0
Anything between there would be the one third and the two thirds right   there	And if you keep going up to there you will hit that and   that will be two thirds   and if you put a bar right there it would count as one   two thirds between 1 would be three thirds	4.0
And if you keep going up to there you will hit that and   that will be two thirds   and if you put a bar right there it would count as one   two thirds between 1 would be three thirds	Because like I was saying if you started there at zero    then zero does not have value	4.0
I wanted to give Sarah and Beth  and Audra a chance to share their idea and if everyone listen a bit more we  will  see what we are thinking in a few minutes	We thought that we did not have to put anything else on the number line because  if we put this from zero to 1 and you would mark one third here because if you  used a ruler here to measure it or something  one third would go here  two thirds would go here  three thirds would go herebecause the length will be the same as Cuisenaire rods  or something	4.0
Where would you place the threethirds	We would place it here	3.0
How many of you believe it should go right on top of the one	Thats what we meant	0.0
Thats what we meant	We just could not get it right on top to fit	3.0
You meant to put it on top	You just put it under it	3.0
J	I want to think about it a little more	0.0
James	I think one half and one half makes a whole and four fourths would make a  whole and three thirds would make a whole also so it will be right on top of the  one	4.0
Are you agreeing with that Jakki	Yes	1.0
What do you think we  are going to do now	Fill in that number board	3.0
Are you   all thinking of your numbers	Oh	0.0
Oh	No	0.0
Where would you put it	On top	3.0
Is that fair	UmHun	0.0
Brian	Should we go from zero to one	0.0
All eyes are on Audra to see what she will pick	No	1.0
No	Thats not right	1.0
Thats not right	She puts one half on the zero	1.0
She puts one half on the zero	That is half between  negative and positive but that is not a half on the number line	3.0
That is half between  negative and positive but that is not a half on the number line	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	She is putting a half there we have three negative and three positive numbers she  is using negative three as the beginning of the line and the positive three as the  end	1.0
She is putting a half there we have three negative and three positive numbers she  is using negative three as the beginning of the line and the positive three as the  end	It should be one half between zero and three because on that side is the negative  side	4.0
Bryan thinks it should go between the zero and the three	I do too	1.0
I do too	I think she is right	1.0
I think she is right	I dont think so because its at the end	4.0
Graham	Well she might have thought the ones before the zero like the three two one  were not negative	1.0
Where would you put the one half  Graham	But if I did not know it was negative I would put it under the zero	3.0
You would put it under the zero	If I didnt know it was negative	3.0
David	I agree with Audra because since it is integers it would go both ways zero is one  half of the whole thing that keeps on going cause that where you start you can  keep on going either way but that is the middle	4.0
I agree with Audra because since it is integers it would go both ways zero is one  half of the whole thing that keeps on going cause that where you start you can  keep on going either way but that is the middle	I agree with Audra and David because there is no way	1.0
I agree with Audra and David because there is no way	I heard Michael say that  the half would have to be on the positive side its integers they keep going if it is  on the positive side its not going to be equal halves the negatives would be larger  than the positives and if you even make the number line bigger zero is right in  the middle so it is going to have to be half	4.0
Lets here from Jessica	Well on that number line it really is half because if you are going to put it on  this side or this side would be really be a quarter	4.0
Well on that number line it really is half because if you are going to put it on  this side or this side would be really be a quarter	If you put it on the two it will  be a quarter because you will have one two three and then four	4.0
I want to make that my number line	That is not half anymore	3.0
Alan	Since you added on the four then that mean you now have four numbers positive  but three numbers negative	3.0
By the way do I really have four numbers positive	You have four numbers negative	3.0
You have four numbers negative	You have five numbers positive   zero one  two three and four	3.0
Numbers up to four	This cant be one half	3.0
Does that number line end at four	No	0.0
Does it end at five	No	0.0
Where does it end	Nowhere	3.0
Nowhere	It keeps on going	3.0
It keeps on going	Infinity	3.0
Where does it end on the other side	Nowhere	3.0
Nowhere	Infinity	3.0
I would like to know where I would put  negative one half	Negative one half	0.0
Negative one half	You have to have an even number	3.0
You have to have an even number	All negative numbers are different than positive	4.0
All negative numbers are different than positive	From here down you are negatives so that means any number  here cannot be equivalent to a number over there  so that means if you were dividing this part up into fractions   you would have to put one half mark in the negative right about there	4.0
So you would put a negative one half between negative one and negative two	Yeah	0.0
What do you think about that Meredith	Because one and one and one half and one half is three	4.0
Where would you put threequarters	Negative or positive	2.0
Positive threequarters	Positive threequarters that is simple	0.0
Why dont you all sit  down	If you are asking where is three fourths three fourths would be here here and  here	4.0
If you are asking where is three fourths three fourths would be here here and  here	This would be onequarter this would be twoquarters this would be three quarters and this would be fourquarters	4.0
This would be onequarter this would be twoquarters this would be three quarters and this would be fourquarters	This would be one and onequarter this would be one and twoquarters	4.0
This would be one and onequarter this would be one and twoquarters	This would be one and threequarters this would be one and fourquarters	4.0
I am very confused	If you have zero to one it would not be from zero to four	4.0
If you have zero to one it would not be from zero to four	You would not divide  it like that	4.0
You would not divide  it like that	You would divide it one fourth two fourths three fourths four  fourths	4.0
You would divide it one fourth two fourths three fourths four  fourths	This would be one and one fourth  one and two fourths one and three  fourths two	4.0
Do not tell me where to  put it	No	0.0
How many of you want to keep it there	No	0.0
Amy	You could keep it there but you have to add negative four	3.0
You could keep it there but you have to add negative four	You have to do something to keep it there	1.0
David	I think Audra is using the whole thing while Meredith is using from zero to two	1.0
I think Audra is using the whole thing while Meredith is using from zero to two	When adding up all those numbers on the negative side would just be like doing  nothing	3.0
I am kind of  curious where she would do that	She is like cutting the number line	1.0
I hope you will straighten me out because I am so  confused	It doesnt	3.0
It doesnt	When you put one more number four	4.0
When you put one more number four	Before it was from negative three to three  when it was from negative three to three so zero was one half	4.0
Before it was from negative three to three  when it was from negative three to three so zero was one half	But now that you  added the four to the positive side it is not one half both sides of the negative and  positive are not equivalent	4.0
Did you say that Michael	UmHun	0.0
UmHun	You could put a million millionths there	3.0
James	I think that one half might go between zero and one	4.0
I think that one half might go between zero and one	Half of it is negative one  negative two negative three	4.0
Half of it is negative one  negative two negative three	The other half is one two three four	4.0
So am I hearing James say that one half is another name for two fourths	UmHum	0.0
What do you think is that possibility	Yeah	0.0
That one half is  another name for two fourths	Yeah	0.0
Audra	I agree because	4.0
I agree because	even fractions so that	4.0
Want to think about that	Well one half could be anywhere between these number	3.0
Well one half could be anywhere between these number	one half could be  between	3.0
Andrew and then James	I think what we are all getting confused about is the length of the number line	4.0
I think what we are all getting confused about is the length of the number line	We have five positive number and four negative numbers counting the zero	4.0
We have five positive number and four negative numbers counting the zero	They are not exactly the same so you would have to put one half a little more  over to the positive side where two fourths is now that we have three negative  number and four positive numbers	4.0
How many agree that is what the confusion is	No	1.0
James	I think the confusion is one half is in the middle of two things	4.0
I think the confusion is one half is in the middle of two things	So it is confusing  to see in which place between three to four two to three one to two zero to one  negative one to zero  negative two to negative one	4.0
So it is confusing  to see in which place between three to four two to three one to two zero to one  negative one to zero  negative two to negative one	I think that is the confusion	0.0
Would you place one half here would you place number one half here	Yeah	0.0
I agree  that you could find the one half the length between two and three I agree but  could place the number one half here	It has to be two and one half	3.0
Andrew	It has to be two and one half	3.0
You could put two and one half here I could take this and split it in one half but I  would not put one half here I would put two and one half	Agree	3.0
Thats okay Brian we can hear you	Between the zero and the one would be a one half	4.0
Between the zero and the one would be a one half	Between the one and the two  would be one and one half	4.0
Between the one and the two  would be one and one half	Between two and three would be two and one half	4.0
Between two and three would be two and one half	Between three and four would be three and one half and the same on the negative  side	4.0
What are they thinking Alan	They were thinking negative numbers are equal to positive numbers	1.0
They were thinking negative numbers are equal to positive numbers	That is  probably what they are thinking	0.0
That is  probably what they are thinking	Because you cannot add negative numbers and  have them be positive numbers	4.0
Because you cannot add negative numbers and  have them be positive numbers	Audra was thinking all that is 1 whole and its not	1.0
Audra was thinking all that is 1 whole and its not	The negative numbers are lower than zero	4.0
The negative numbers are lower than zero	Zero is said to be the lowest number and they are lower than the lowest	4.0
Meredith	It is like a ruler here it has the inches one half one and one half two and one  half three and one half four and one half five and one half and so on	4.0
It is starting to make some sense	OhmHum	0.0
Are we going to leave it there or take that one half off	Take it off	3.0
David what do you think	Well I think that if you one half would be right in  the middle that would be the biggest	4.0
Well I think that if you one half would be right in  the middle that would be the biggest	Then one third  that would be kind of smaller because you have fit  three pieces in there	4.0
Then one third  that would be kind of smaller because you have fit  three pieces in there	Then one fourth would be  even smaller than one third	4.0
Call something one and  zero draw it	Maybe the orange	0.0
Just sketch it	If this is the one here	4.0
If this is the one here	then one half would be there	4.0
Can you mark one half right where you put it like  put it underneath so we can see it	What do you mean	2.0
Just draw the number one half where you want to  show one half	Then one third	4.0
Then one third	And then like one fourth	4.0
Where do you think one fifth would be Meredith	The whole would be divided into fifths	3.0
So do you think it would be to the right of a quarter  or to the left of a quarter	Left	3.0
What do you think the next question Im going to  ask you	Where would you put one third	3.0
Someone disagrees	I do	1.0
I do	The one third approximately needs to be a  little more over because the one fourth has to  be  half of the one half	4.0
The one third approximately needs to be a  little more over because the one fourth has to  be  half of the one half	So if you put one fourth half of  that it would be on the left  of the one third	4.0
So if you put one fourth half of  that it would be on the left  of the one third	I know	0.0
I know	I didnt I didnt put the one third	3.0
I didnt I didnt put the one third	The one  third if it was one fourth it would probably be about  here right or just about an inch over	3.0
The one  third if it was one fourth it would probably be about  here right or just about an inch over	So its not its  just approximate cause I dont think	3.0
You want to call on Andrew to put in the one  quarter	rew Should I call on someone to place one fifth	0.0
What do you think	I disagree	1.0
For  those of you that disagree	Well if one fifth is next to the end	4.0
Well if one fifth is next to the end	Then five plus  five equals up to ten so it would be like in the half	4.0
Jakki thinks one tenth should go in the middle	no	1.0
James	I think it should go more towards zero	3.0
I think it should go more towards zero	yeah	1.0
Alan	I think that the one tenth should be moved over just  a tiny bit	3.0
Its getting hard to do this isnt it	Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into  tenths and you have a half mark	4.0
Up there you have a whole you are dividing it into  tenths and you have a half mark	So you have to use  this as a guideline youd have five tenths on one  side and five tenths on the other side	4.0
So you have to use  this as a guideline youd have five tenths on one  side and five tenths on the other side	Now up there if you took that little space between the zero  and the one fifth and you cut that five times it  wouldnt reach the half way mark	4.0
Now up there if you took that little space between the zero  and the one fifth and you cut that five times it  wouldnt reach the half way mark	Its like one two three four this is all	3.0
Brian	I agree with Mark	1.0
I agree with Mark	It is a little far back	3.0
It is a little far back	I think the  third should be moved up then the fourth should be  moved up	3.0
I think the  third should be moved up then the fourth should be  moved up	I thought the fifth was wrong when I did  it because everything was kinda moved back	4.0
You can put your papers the long way if you  want	One fifth	0.0
One fifth	one tenth	4.0
one tenth	One tenth would be one two three four five sixth    one two three four five sixth seven eight nine  ten	4.0
One tenth would be one two three four five sixth    one two three four five sixth seven eight nine  ten	It would be right about there  one tenth right	4.0
It would be right about there  one tenth right	One hundredth	4.0
One hundredth	One onehundredth	1.0
One onehundredth	Would be right here	1.0
Would be right here	That would be like on top of the zero almost	1.0
That would be like on top of the zero almost	And then one thousandth would be right there	1.0
And then one thousandth would be right there	On top of it Like one onehundredths and one one thousands well like one onehundredth would be  right there and   One thousandths would be right on  the zero	4.0
Then where would one tenthousandths be	You would have to have a bigger thing	3.0
You would have to have a bigger thing	I think	0.0
I think	if you squish it together then you could put it  all together	3.0
if you squish it together then you could put it  all together	Well it depends on  Well	1.0
Well it depends on  Well	It sort of depends how big	1.0
It sort of depends how big	No not really because	1.0
No not really because	Otherwise you would have to squish it all in	3.0
You were saying Andrew	It would be like something you really cannot see	4.0
It would be like something you really cannot see	Actually you would need something like a stop watch  to figure it out	4.0
Actually you would need something like a stop watch  to figure it out	It does not matter what size it is  because you will still have to have one half and a one  third would still take up as much room as anything  else so	4.0
It does not matter what size it is  because you will still have to have one half and a one  third would still take up as much room as anything  else so	I wonder where one onethousandth would go	2.0
I wonder where one onethousandth would go	Oh  I know where one onethousandths would go thats  easy	0.0
Oh  I know where one onethousandths would go thats  easy	I think it would be one onehundredth one  onethousandenths and one onetenthousandths	3.0
Okay	Dr Maher I think I have oneone hundredth one  onethousandth  and one one umm ten thousandth  or Then you could do one onehundred thousandenths and one onemillionths	3.0
Dr Maher I think I have oneone hundredth one  onethousandth  and one one umm ten thousandth  or Then you could do one onehundred thousandenths and one onemillionths	How high are we supposed to go	2.0
How high are we supposed to go	I went to one onehundredth	3.0
I went to one onehundredth	Up to one onehundredth	3.0
Up to one onehundredth	Fifty should be here on the one hundredth so  its like	3.0
Fifty should be here on the one hundredth so  its like	One one Hundreds	1.0
One one Hundreds	one onethousandth would be at the  window	3.0
one onethousandth would be at the  window	Would one onethousandth be somewhere on this  line or somewhere near the window	2.0
Would one onethousandth be somewhere on this  line or somewhere near the window	You would have to make the line bigger	3.0
You would have to make the line bigger	Probably not	3.0
Probably not	Michael and  Erik In stead of making it exact but they will be a little  more approximate	3.0
Michael and  Erik In stead of making it exact but they will be a little  more approximate	Meredith	0.0
Meredith	I think I know where the hundredths would go	4.0
I think I know where the hundredths would go	Because zero five ten fifteen 15 would go in there	4.0
Because zero five ten fifteen 15 would go in there	100 would go in there 1000 would go in there	4.0
100 would go in there 1000 would go in there	Its like a pattern	4.0
If youre done and youre waiting for other  people to finish could you mark on your line where  three fourths would be	Three fourths	3.0
Three fourths	One third one fourth three fourths would probably  be in the middle	3.0
One third one fourth three fourths would probably  be in the middle	Hum	0.0
Hum	Well three fourths would probably be in the middle  of one fourth and one third	3.0
How are you all doing here	I mean	0.0
I mean	Three fourths	3.0
Three fourths	Oh	0.0
Oh	I think it  would be between them	3.0
I think it  would be between them	Here	0.0
I see one third here and I see one third here	Yeah I did it on both sides	3.0
Yeah I did it on both sides	Yeah I did it on both sides	1.0
How does that work	Well you see it does not matter because I just did it  on both sides so that it this doesnt like work	4.0
Well you see it does not matter because I just did it  on both sides so that it this doesnt like work	Yeah that is what I did I did it on both  sides	1.0
Yeah that is what I did I did it on both  sides	You could go by that way	3.0
You could go by that way	Or you could go by that way	3.0
So you just sort have done it a  mirror image  both ways	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah you could just you could just do  it like that	3.0
I see	Yeah	0.0
I see you put one one hundredth right there	Yeah	0.0
Thats interesting	What I thought was that I was trying to estimate  count all the way up to one half because	3.0
How many times did you have to count	Like if you wanted to put the exact one hundredth  you would have to make it the length	4.0
Like if you wanted to put the exact one hundredth  you would have to make it the length	All even	1.0
All even	The length to count all the way up to fifty by one  half then the other fifty in the other one half	4.0
Oh	So you would have to imagine  the length	3.0
What do you think if you were going from zero to  one tenth how many times would you have to count  to place one hundredth	Well zero to one tenth you would have to place one  hundredth about ten times because ten	4.0
Well zero to one tenth you would have to place one  hundredth about ten times because ten	Fifteen	4.0
Fifteen	Twenty	4.0
Twenty	Thirty	4.0
Thirty	Forty Fifty	4.0
Forty Fifty	Well yeah I think it would be like ten times	4.0
And then you could divide it into ten pieces	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	About ten times	3.0
David	Ohm	0.0
Ohm	Over there	3.0
Where would you put three	Further over	3.0
Would it be in the building	no	0.0
Would it be outside the building	yes	0.0
yes	Youd be all the way to Pittsburg Pennsylvania	0.0
I bet when you did number lines  before you didnt place numbers between zero and one  did you	no	0.0
I see some  interesting questions have arisen	About the 1100	0.0
About the 1100	I think	0.0
Lets talk about the other ones first	Well between zero and one you can divide it into those  fractions	4.0
Well between zero and one you can divide it into those  fractions	Such as the three fourths would go there  because you would  have the one third there and place one fourth there	4.0
Such as the three fourths would go there  because you would  have the one third there and place one fourth there	And  it would take three of those to get up to  that mark	4.0
And  it would take three of those to get up to  that mark	The one half you could use a guideline	4.0
The one half you could use a guideline	The  others one tenth one onehundredth and one one thousandth	4.0
The  others one tenth one onehundredth and one one thousandth	I made another because you couldnt really see it on the  other That is where the one thousandth  would be	4.0
I made another because you couldnt really see it on the  other That is where the one thousandth  would be	You couldnt really make anything bigger than  that because it would be too hard to see	4.0
Alan	You could put basically the one third in any place in any  three places of that number line because you could have  the thirds going either way	4.0
You could put basically the one third in any place in any  three places of that number line because you could have  the thirds going either way	I mean you could take it out  from there you could take it out from there or you could  take it out from there	4.0
I mean you could take it out  from there you could take it out from there or you could  take it out from there	It really doesnt matter	4.0
It really doesnt matter	So you  really could put it in three different places	4.0
So where would a second place for that  one third be	The second place for that one third would be somewhere  up here approximately	3.0
Where would you put two thirds	Two thirds would go right there	4.0
Two thirds would go right there	Because if you have thirds you would be dividing that  into three parts so you could put it in three different  places	4.0
How are you comparing the places  where you put the second one third and the two thirds	If you use the rods to sort of bracket like this	3.0
Lets do that	Here you have thirds	3.0
Im asking you to mark one third but  remember where I marked zero and one with respect to  where I marked my zero and one	You could mark the one third here	3.0
You could mark the one third here	or you could mark it between here	3.0
or you could mark it between here	or you could mark it here	3.0
So place the number one third on that number line	The number one third would go here	3.0
Im kind of wondering what you are thinking	Well I would put  it there	3.0
If that is your number  line and not rods anymore	Well basically what you can do is this could be a third and between there and here that could be a third	3.0
I believe that	Basically what comes to mind when you think of  fractions you only think of the first one	4.0
Basically what comes to mind when you think of  fractions you only think of the first one	because you could put it here	4.0
because you could put it here	here	4.0
here	or here	4.0
or here	and it would still be one third	4.0
and it would still be one third	But you could put one third	4.0
But you could put one third	two thirds	4.0
two thirds	or three thirds	4.0
or three thirds	You could put it in any one of those three places but you  could still go one third	4.0
You could put it in any one of those three places but you  could still go one third	That would be one third	4.0
That would be one third	or that would be one one third	4.0
Andrew	I dont think it would work because if you just put red in  the middle and call that one third then if you put then on  the left side of it three thirds then on the right side of it two thirds then you would be reading it two thirds one  third three thirds	4.0
I dont think it would work because if you just put red in  the middle and call that one third then if you put then on  the left side of it three thirds then on the right side of it two thirds then you would be reading it two thirds one  third three thirds	So uhm wherever you put it in that  space you always are going to have to start from zero  because you cannot go from one down to zero because  that is getting bigger	4.0
So uhm wherever you put it in that  space you always are going to have to start from zero  because you cannot go from one down to zero because  that is getting bigger	Because if you start it like that then  you are just switching the zero and one	4.0
Because if you start it like that then  you are just switching the zero and one	Right	1.0
Right	but you could put one third in anyone of these  places but basically what comes to mind once you think of  fractions is that you always think of the first one it could  go in anyone of these	3.0
The length of  all of those rods are all one third and you are marking off  the rods the lengths of one third right	Yeah	0.0
But when you mark off the rods to mark off where you  place the numbers is it okay then to make all those  numbers equal to one third	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You could put that there it would be equal to one  third	3.0
That length is one third but when you place your  numbers on the number line can you write them all as one  third	No	0.0
No	You can put that in the beginning on the number line  but when you think of fractions you could put it in anyone  of these places as long as like you are not basically trying  to divide put another rod in there like this then you would have to put something through there	4.0
You can put that in the beginning on the number line  but when you think of fractions you could put it in anyone  of these places as long as like you are not basically trying  to divide put another rod in there like this then you would have to put something through there	But  you could put the third in any one of those but they are all  the same length each so they still have the same fraction  value of one third	4.0
Andrew	Yeah but you see if youre doing that you see you put it  in the middle right then the one on the left side of it is  blank so what they would think it needs to be filled in so  they would fill it in and it would be two thirds because  they mostly have spaces because you take zero to one  hundred	4.0
Yeah but you see if youre doing that you see you put it  in the middle right then the one on the left side of it is  blank so what they would think it needs to be filled in so  they would fill it in and it would be two thirds because  they mostly have spaces because you take zero to one  hundred	You cant go one third would be next to one  hundred it would have to put like it would be three thirds  next to one hundred because if you divide zero to one  hundred into thirds you cant go from one third	4.0
You cant go one third would be next to one  hundred it would have to put like it would be three thirds  next to one hundred because if you divide zero to one  hundred into thirds you cant go from one third	And then  by the zero it would be three thirds	4.0
Why not	Its not the way to put  A ruler has the different numbers  that you count by so if you have all these 1s and you dont  have the numbers that they belong to then	4.0
Well Alan would argue I think maybe not that this is  one and this is the same length one inch and this is the  same length one inch so why cant we mark these all one	They are the same length but you could take three more  of these	3.0
Im making a ruler here for  fractions	Right but if you say you wanted to divide it	4.0
Right but if you say you wanted to divide it	A ruler  shows you how long something is like up here say the red is one inch one inch	4.0
A ruler  shows you how long something is like up here say the red is one inch one inch	And if you add another one inch on there then that would  be two inches	4.0
And if you add another one inch on there then that would  be two inches	and you add another inch on there it would be three  inches	4.0
What  number would I put here if I were making a number line or ruler	Youd put one there	4.0
Youd put one there	Two there and three there because that would be one inch and that would be two  inches and that would be three inches	4.0
David you were going to say  something	Well I was just going to say that uhm they may be all the  same thing but when youre measuring something then  you know that if it is an inch you know how many instead  of just counting all of them	4.0
Yes Cassie	Do we do it on our head or on our paper	0.0
And you dont have to copy the question you can just show your thinking	He said that he multiplied it so the area is right but 7 times 4	4.0
The top one were doing the top one first	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mmm	0.0
Or to show me why	I feel like this one cause like I agree with Robbie because	3.0
Can you show it in a picture	Yeah	0.0
And why do you think with the friend	Because its 12 which is 3 inches 3 inches	4.0
It says Robbie says the area	Oh	0.0
Oh	Area	3.0
Oh you were thinking perimeter	Yeah	0.0
Okay so who do you agree with	Robbie	3.0
And can you prove it	I think	0.0
How could you prove it in the picture	Um  I dont know	0.0
Can you prove it in the picture	Is it width times length	3.0
Ask Jason	Is it	0.0
So why dont you explain what you did	Um to the	0.0
Which part of the picture is the area	The length times width	3.0
Oh so the   which part of the picture	inside	3.0
What does that mean	Theres 9 squares	3.0
So now who do you agree with	Robbie	3.0
You  Why	Because theres 9 squares in the box	4.0
And then what is his friend thinking	Theres 12	3.0
So what   his friend is his friend confused	Yeah	0.0
Whats his friend thinking	The perimeter	3.0
Cassie	Um you could take a ruler some sort of ruler and measure the length and then the width and then you could multiply them	4.0
Brandon	Finding out what is the length and what is the width	3.0
Alex	After you found it out you would multiply them	3.0
What did that student do	Its the area	4.0
Its the area	And the total of it is 9 sided	4.0
And the total of it is 9 sided	Which is the area	4.0
Which is the area	Cause 3 which is the length and 3 which is the width	4.0
Cause 3 which is the length and 3 which is the width	You multiply those two and its 9	4.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
What do you see	The area	3.0
And what is the area	9	3.0
What are you actually seeing	9 boxes	3.0
Can anyone tell me	Squares	3.0
What did you do	I drew 3  cause I made 3 columns and 3 rows	4.0
Why	Because there are 3 inches on the width and 3 inches on the length	4.0
Alex	Inches	3.0
Stacey	Square inches	3.0
DAndre	Its 1 inch squared	3.0
Its what was that	Its 1 inch squared	3.0
Shira	9	3.0
Cassie	9 inches  squared	3.0
Do you guys agree with Robbie or his friend	Robbie	3.0
David	He confused the area and the perimeter	3.0
Can you explain a little more	He thought the perimeter was the area	3.0
Can you tell me why 12 inches might be the perimeter	Because its 4 sides	4.0
Its 4 sides	and 3 inches each	3.0
What does the 28 actually mean	Its the area	3.0
And then what do you have there	What	0.0
What do you have there	12345   28	3.0
Or the perimeter	Its the area	3.0
His friend said what did his friend say	That the area is 22	3.0
And do you agree	No	0.0
What was the friend confused about	I think its because he um accidentally added	4.0
What was he doing	Um figuring out the perimeter	3.0
Can you figure out the perimeter then	Yeah	0.0
So what was his friend thinking	That the area was that youre supposed to add	3.0
So then you just proved that this is what	22	3.0
And thats the	Perimeter	3.0
Show me the perimeter on your rectangle	How	2.0
What did we do with the first picture	We colored the outside	3.0
So could you show me the perimeter	Like this	3.0
What did you do there	I  um showed the numbers the number in square inches and added the numbers like 28	3.0
So then you agreed with  Robbie	Mmm hmm	0.0
And so what was his friend thinking	I think his friend was thinking Yeah	0.0
I think his friend was thinking Yeah	I think he was counting the perimeter instead	3.0
Mmm hmm	Cause 7  cause  he was adding instead of multiplying	4.0
Mmmm	He was adding all the length and width	3.0
So maybe after you talk I might get some new hands up	Uh the square inches for the	3.0
So then whats the area of this rectangle	28	3.0
And how do you know	Because of the square inches	4.0
The square inches  youre actually looking at  whats inside	The area	3.0
What do you see	Um um	0.0
Like what did you draw inside	Uh squares	3.0
And how many squares are inside	28	3.0
Okay thank you Connie	She put 4 rows and 7 columns	3.0
Okay why	Because its 4 is the height and 7 is the width	4.0
What shape do you see inside	Squares	3.0
Desiree	Because greens the perimeter	4.0
Okay and red is	the area	3.0
Uh Carl	Robbie	3.0
Why	Because its supposed to be 28	4.0
Its supposed to be 28 and instead his friend said	22	3.0
About the label	He didnt do the	0.0
What didnt he do	The perimeter and the area when you measure the area it has to be square inches	3.0
mmm	Instead of just regular inches	3.0
And how come square inches	Because theres squares inside the area	4.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
Do you have anything to add	No	0.0
So how many squares are inside here	28	3.0
Um Erica	Hes thinking area is in square inches and like when you do perimeter you dont have square inches	3.0
Lorraine	So they know its the area	4.0
Alex	Um we do it by square inches	3.0
Good morning	Good morning	0.0
Amanda	That there would be   school on Saturday	3.0
Krishna	We ll get older	3.0
Jessie	The A s will win tonight	3.0
Do you guys know	They did win	0.0
They did win	They won	0.0
Ivan	We were trying to figure out whether to put it on likely or equally likely	3.0
Why was that	Because since the A s are a stronger team than the other team they were playing that night so we were thinking that maybe it would be   actually   wait	4.0
Because since the A s are a stronger team than the other team they were playing that night so we were thinking that maybe it would be   actually   wait	Actually equally likely and likely because we were thinking   since A s is the stronger team it might   they might like win since it s stronger than the other team that they were playing that night	4.0
Josh	Someone who in this class would change their name	3.0
Abir	That we will have science lab	3.0
Is it okay to put it anywhere on the likelihood line	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	1.0
Zarra	Anywhere because you can t   it can be in the middle cause you never know	4.0
Okay go	Maybe it snows once	3.0
What did you decide	It never snows in some places	3.0
How about Devon	We all agreed that   we all agreed that we should put it like in the middle of these two but closer to impossible because it s not totally impossible that it might snow but it s really unlikely cause we have warm weather	4.0
Devon did you   you all agreed is that what you said	Yeah	0.0
Brandon come on up	I will put it near   I will put it in the middle but a little bit more to unlikely because even though it doesn t snow in Fremont it snows in some   some parts of California and we all agreed on that	4.0
Is that what you agreed Jonathan	I thought we all agreed to possible	1.0
Jonathan why don t you   why don t you just take the pointer from Brandon and show him what you thought you understood why you guys were discussing it cause it sounds like you guys have a little bit of different understanding	I thought we agreed to do impossible cause we   it   it never snows here	4.0
I thought we agreed to do impossible cause we   it   it never snows here	Like he said it does snow in some parts of California	1.0
What do you think	Impossible	3.0
There s no right or wrong answer here	Lean towards Jonathan	1.0
Why do you think it should go there	Cause sometimes kids are absent and most of the time they are here	4.0
Do you agree with that	I think it should go between	3.0
Tell me your group agreed with you or   thought differently and Areesh	We decided in between equally likely and likely because it s spring and a lot of like   there s allergies   people could get allergies could be sick and be absent	4.0
We decided in between equally likely and likely because it s spring and a lot of like   there s allergies   people could get allergies could be sick and be absent	So we put it inbetween equally likely and likely	4.0
Did you all kind of agree with that or	We agreed	1.0
Go ahead and pass it to whomever you d like	I think that it could be fiftyfifty because   well mostly now we aren t getting anybody that s absent and sometimes we do get absents	4.0
I think that it could be fiftyfifty because   well mostly now we aren t getting anybody that s absent and sometimes we do get absents	But now we re not mostly getting absent students so it could be fifty fifty cause we never know like today we don t have anybody absent and tomorrow we might have someone absent	4.0
Okay go ahead and take one and pass that back	We don t have a spelling pretest this week	0.0
I m hearing people whisper what is it	Zero	3.0
Samuel said   Samuel go ahead you have your hand in the air	Well I think I know the rest	0.0
Okay why don t you tell me   what you re thinking the number would be for certain	A hundred	3.0
A hundred what	Percent	3.0
What do you mean by a hundred percent	For sure	3.0
Okay so what does a hundred percent mean to you	It WILL happen	3.0
Inderneil	Half	3.0
Tell me what you re thinking with half	Like fifty is half cause a hundred percent and a hundred percent is full	4.0
Does fifty percent and one half mean the same	Yes	0.0
Josh	I would say twenty percent	3.0
Okay why would you say twenty percent	I would say twenty percent because   twenty percent because	3.0
Are you changing your mind	I m still thinking twenty percent but I just don t know how to put it why	3.0
Joshua why don t you call on someone in the room to help you out with this	Brandon	0.0
Brandon	I know the answer though	0.0
Go ahead	It s twenty five percent because if   I thought if I can count from the inside   from inside each will equal up to twenty and then the lines represent every five so   five ten fifteen twenty and then twenty five goes on the line	4.0
Broken up into four spaces	Yes	0.0
What do you think Josh	Yeah	0.0
Twenty five percent	I know another way too	0.0
I know another way too	You just subtract twentyfive off of all of them	4.0
You just subtract twentyfive off of all of them	So likely it s gonna be I m not gonna say the answer though	0.0
Can you clarify that for us	So one hundred minus twentyfive is seventyfive	4.0
So everybody what are we gonna put here	Seventy five	3.0
Seventyfive	Percent	3.0
There s actually more than one way to write it but   Abir	Three fourths	3.0
Nakila	One fourth	3.0
I d like to put the vocabulary down as well	Are percentages related to fractions	3.0
Why don t you copy that down too	Instead of 50100 s can I put 510s	3.0
Show me which	Can I put 510s instead of 50100s	3.0
So how many tiles are in here	Ten	3.0
What you got	Green	0.0
Okay	Green	0.0
How about Tarin	Green	0.0
Do you think it s unlikely equally likely or likely I m gonna pull a yellow tile out of the bag	Equal	3.0
Equal	Unlikely	1.0
Unlikely	Equally likely	1.0
Why are you thinking equally likely Hafasta	Cause it s fifty fifty	4.0
Cause it s fifty fifty	It might happen and it might not	1.0
Marcus	Unlikely because there was more greens pulled out than yellows	4.0
What did you get	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	First yellow tile	0.0
Green	Green	0.0
What about over here	Green	0.0
How many tiles did we say I had in the bag	Ten	3.0
How many times total have we drawn a tile out of the bag	Ten	3.0
How many yellow tile and how many green tiles you think I have in this bag	Six	3.0
Six	Five green Six green and four yellow	1.0
Five green Six green and four yellow	No I think seven greens and three yellows	1.0
Why do you think seven greens and three yellows Robert	Cause it s on the board	0.0
Jonathan what are you thinking	Somebody somebody could have pulled out the same tile that somebody else already	3.0
Abir	I think that there s six green and four yellows	3.0
Go ahead	That s all	0.0
Hafasa	I guessed that there s seven   seven green and three yellows	3.0
Do you all agree with that	Yeah	1.0
can you   can you tell me why	Because on the chart it says seven greens I mean yeah seven greens and three yellows	4.0
Jonathan can I get you back up to do some more recording for me	I did it already	0.0
Yellow	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	Green	0.0
Green	Green	0.0
Green	Green	0.0
Green	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	Green	0.0
Green	Green	0.0
Is it likely equally likely or unlikely that we re gonna pull a yellow out of the bag	Likely	0.0
Likely	Unlikely	1.0
Unlikely	Equally likely	1.0
Sarab	Likely	3.0
Likely	Likely that we ll pull a green	3.0
So what do you think about pulling about pulling a yellow	In the middle of the likely and equally likely	3.0
Could it be impossible	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Yes	FiftyFifty	1.0
Could it be impossible that we re gonna pull a yellow	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
No	If you take out all the yellows then it s impossible to take out to a yellow	1.0
Would it be impossible on the next draw	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Is there anybody in the class who thinks it s impossible that we could draw a yellow on the next draw	In the middle of unlikely and impossible	3.0
Why	Well because	0.0
Well because	Like   there s more greens than yellow so	4.0
Like   there s more greens than yellow so	I m thinking that   I m thinking there s more greens that there is yellow	4.0
So you re thinking more towards the impossible but you re not thinking totally impossible	Yeah	0.0
Let s take a few more draws	Yellow	0.0
It s all right	Green	0.0
All right we ll take one more	Green	0.0
How many times did we sample   pull a sample out of the bag	Twenty three	3.0
How many greens and how many yellows	What were the last 3 draws	2.0
Do you remember what the last 3 draws were	I just wanted to do the math	0.0
I just wanted to do the math	If you take away the last three draws you have twenty	4.0
If you take away the last three draws you have twenty	Take away the last 3 draws you would have twenty	1.0
Take away the last 3 draws you would have twenty	Thirteen and seven	1.0
Thirteen and seven	I would say that there would be more so estimated but then you can t divide them by two	1.0
Why do you have thirteen and seven	Thirteen are the greens	4.0
And now what do you think	If I just made this one more I would say there would be seven greens	4.0
If I just made this one more I would say there would be seven greens	Seven greens and three yellows in the bag	1.0
What makes you say that	Either seventhree or sixfour	3.0
But you wanted to work with twenty	Yeah	0.0
Why would	It s just an easier number	3.0
Sarab	I m changing it to six greens and four yellows	3.0
Do you remember	Seven greens and three yellows	3.0
And why are you changing	Cause	0.0
Cause	Well cause yellows are like on a winning streak	4.0
What do you mean	Like I think five   a lot of yellows were drawn but there were only a few more greens were drawn	4.0
Okay so when we sampled again you saw more yellows than when we sampled the first time	In the middle of equally likely	3.0
Yes	I think that there s five greens and five yellows because it could have been that people were repicking the green picking the yellow cause there might be five of each and plus five goes into ten equally	4.0
Josh	I would say eight greens and two yellows	3.0
I would say eight greens and two yellows	Because even though more yellows were picked that doesn t meant that there s more yellows than green	4.0
Hafasa	Have you decided that it was five and five cause you said that there was ten tiles in the paper bag and five and five equals ten and when we picked out more cause we   we didn t   we put them back them in you told them to pick out more	4.0
So you re agreeing with this	Five and five	3.0
What do we got	One	0.0
One	One yellow	0.0
One yellow	One green	0.0
One green	Another green	0.0
Another green	Two green	0.0
Two green	Three green	0.0
Three green	Four green	0.0
Four green	Five green	0.0
Five green	Six green	0.0
So how many yellows	Two Four	3.0
That s what we have so far	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	I won the lotto	0.0
I won the lotto	Yellow	0.0
Yellow	Yeah	0.0
This one right here	Twenty five red and five blues	3.0
Twenty five red and five blues	The blue lost	1.0
R stands for	Red	0.0
And B stands for	Blue	0.0
Are they mixed up	Yup	0.0
Red	Blue	0.0
Okay how many   how many samples have we taken so far total here	Nine	3.0
There s a lot more reds	There s a lot more reds	0.0
Robert	Because none of the answers on the chart are up there	4.0
Indraneil	Well because it s like   you don t have enough information yet to   it could be any of them	4.0
Well because it s like   you don t have enough information yet to   it could be any of them	Because some are unlikely but still unlikely   still it s not impossible though	4.0
Because some are unlikely but still unlikely   still it s not impossible though	I think we need to draw some more to find out what more information to find them out	1.0
How many total draws did he have here	Nine	3.0
We ll do one more	Six more	3.0
Why six more	That way we can have thirty	4.0
Krishna how many more do I need to have thirty	One	3.0
One	Two	1.0
Two	Two	1.0
Two	Two	1.0
Red	Last one	0.0
What are you thinking Samuel	Something s wrong	3.0
What s wrong	I was   I was   me and Joshua were against each other   I was thinking that inside this bag there are twenty five red and five blue	3.0
He was thinking twenty red and ten blue	It exceeded twenty and it exceeded five	3.0
Samuel s confused	I m kind of confused too   but still   I still think it s twenty red and ten blues cause it   right now it s twenty two and   if kept on going and she picked three more reds it could still be twenty red and ten blue because it s like   it could be   she could pick another red twice or something	4.0
Why don t you turn around sweetie	I don t get it	2.0
I think I heard you say that it s possible that we could have drawn	More reds	3.0
More reds	Like   the same red like	1.0
More More than one time	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Sam	Yes	0.0
Areesh	I want to say something	0.0
Go ahead	I think that twenty red and ten blue because if you round the red tiles it would be twenty closer to twenty and if you round the blue tiles it would be closest to ten	4.0
Okay	I don t think so	1.0
I don t think so	S I don t think so	1.0
S I don t think so	I didn t choose any of them	1.0
I didn t choose any of them	I don t know	2.0
You re still you re just not sure	I didn t choose any of them	0.0
Do you have a guess or do you have a comment or a question you want to ask us	No	0.0
Let s do it	Red	0.0
Red	Red	0.0
Red	Red	0.0
Go ahead	Red	0.0
You guys are making estimates already huh	Red	0.0

You okay	Red	0.0
Okay	My arm is starting to hurt	0.0
Okay we can   we can stop and take our guest now or we can keep going what are you guys gonna do	Keep going	3.0
Keep going	Stop	1.0
Amanda	Cause we re not sure yet on what estimate   if we   and if we keep on getting red we might get a better guess of what the answer is	4.0
Krishna	The last one twenty five red and five blues	3.0
Is there anybody in the room Samuel or Robert is it important do you think that we keep going to thirty or can we stop to make our prediction	Keep going	3.0
Are you just not sure	I m just not sure	2.0
Robert how about you	Because we don t know the answer yet	4.0
Okay we don t know the answer yet so we have to get to thirty to get to get the answer	Yes	0.0
Go ahead	But then I don t think we have to go all the way to thirty because since we have fifteen and we got   got like   we have enough information because if you multiply both the rows by two then you ve gone to a total of thirty because fifteen   there are fifteen draws in all times two will make thirty draws and you can multiply by two   both sides by two because it would   it would make like a repetition since it s already that much	4.0
So what I m hearing you say is that if we   we re at fifteen draws	Yeah	0.0
So if we just multiply this number by two and we just multiply this number by two	We ll find the answer	3.0
Devon	Because if you can if you multiply three by two that s six	4.0
Because if you can if you multiply three by two that s six	I know but that s close	1.0
I know but that s close	That s pretty close to   that would be twentyfour and six and that s pretty close to twentyfive and five	1.0
That s pretty close to   that would be twentyfour and six and that s pretty close to twentyfive and five	You can estimate it up to that	1.0
You can estimate it up to that	I agree	1.0
I agree	Keep going	1.0

Not sure and that s okay	Well I think when we guess of which combination is up there on the board twentyfive red and five blue is because	4.0
Well I think when we guess of which combination is up there on the board twentyfive red and five blue is because	It just   well twenty four and six are two is	4.0
It just   well twenty four and six are two is	Well   I have it in my mind but it s   it won t come out of my tongue	0.0

Okay go ahead	Josh	0.0
Josh	Well like I said the last time they   there could have been like twenty   more reds could have been pulled like again	4.0
Well like I said the last time they   there could have been like twenty   more reds could have been pulled like again	Like   there   like	0.0

Is it possible that a lot of tiles were picked up more than once	Yes	0.0
Yes	Some tiles are picked once	3.0
What do you think s in this bag everybody	twentyfive red and five blues	3.0
So could you quickly get out your Math books	Excuse me	0.0
Hafasa do you have a question	Ten eleven plus thirteen	3.0
Ten eleven and thirteen might be   let me see	Next page	0.0
Any questions you have for me	No	0.0
Great let s   oh go ahead	How come we re not doing number twelve	0.0
You can   you re welcome to give number twelve a shot if you want	Extra credit	0.0
Can you give me an example of what a prime number is	Like three times one is three	4.0
Like three times one is three	It s one that you can t divide	1.0
Yeah	Ms Thornley	0.0
Ms Thornley	Can we eat our snacks right now	0.0
What about blue ribbon	2 meters	3.0
White ribbon	1 meter	3.0
Ok let s see what Andrew has to say	By the number one it says white ribbon it has one meter  and one meter on the bottom where it says	4.0
By the number one it says white ribbon it has one meter  and one meter on the bottom where it says	And then it says  make a ribbon length of bows and number of bows	4.0
And then it says  make a ribbon length of bows and number of bows	So you  have to find out look under the ribbon length of bow so it  will be one meter and one half how many bows can you get  out of one half a meter	4.0
So you  have to find out look under the ribbon length of bow so it  will be one meter and one half how many bows can you get  out of one half a meter	So you would have to figure out  that	4.0
What does it say on the chart	You have to use ribbon length of the bow	3.0
You have to use ribbon length of the bow	You have to use  one half of a meter	3.0
Ok	One ribbon is a half a meter	3.0
One ribbon is a half a meter	And then you have to figure out how many bows how  many of those bows you make	3.0
From one meter ribbon and each bow is a half  meter in length	And how many bows of that kind	3.0
How  long is that one	The blue ribbon is about 2 meters	3.0
How long is the white one supposed to be	One meter	3.0
Is that one meter	I don t know	0.0
Do you know how big a meter is supposed to be	Three feet	3.0
It s near 3 feet but feet and  meters are different	You know how they are different	3.0
What are you trying to figure out guys	We re trying to figure out the second problem in number  one	0.0
We re trying to figure out the second problem in number  one	One meter is three thirds	4.0
One meter is three thirds	So we have to find three  thirds of this one meter ribbon and then we ll know how  much bows we can make	4.0
So we have to find three  thirds of this one meter ribbon and then we ll know how  much bows we can make	I think I know already	0.0
What do you think you know	I think its three because when you divide thirds up it s one third twothirds threethirds	4.0
I think its three because when you divide thirds up it s one third twothirds threethirds	So it would be like one  ribbon one ribbon one ribbon	4.0
So it would be like one  ribbon one ribbon one ribbon	so divide it into thirds but we need to  make sure	4.0
What do you think of what Andrew said	Yeah I agree with that but we re just making sure	1.0
Ok you think it makes sense but you re just kind of  checking it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I know that fourths is 25	3.0
I know that fourths is 25	It would be right here	3.0
It would be right here	28 40 42	4.0
28 40 42	I think I got 30 and a half	3.0
I think I got 30 and a half	According to him 30 and a half	1.0
According to him 30 and a half	30 60 61  plus 30 is only 91 and a half	4.0
30 60 61  plus 30 is only 91 and a half	What did you get	2.0
What did you get	30 and a  half	0.0
30 and a  half	I think its 32	3.0
I think its 32	32 and 32 is 64	4.0
32 and 32 is 64	Then 32 is 90	4.0
Then 32 is 90	32 and half	1.0
32 and half	So there will be 65	4.0
So there will be 65	32 and 65 is 97	4.0
32 and 65 is 97		4.0
	33 66  99 8 and half	4.0
33 66  99 8 and half	So it would be 100	4.0
So it would be 100		4.0
What was the question	We want three bows	3.0
What  was the number you came up with	James 33	3.0
What was it	Centimeters	3.0
Centimeters	Well Rutgers usually makes us prove what our answer is	0.0
Well Rutgers usually makes us prove what our answer is	So we had to do three divided the ribbon into thirds first  third would be there second would be there and third	4.0
So what was that though actuallythis 33 that you came up  with	One third	3.0
One third	One third yeah one third of a	1.0
One third yeah one third of a	That s sixty fi sixty	3.0
That 33what was it	That was like in centimeters	3.0
Well what is that	We re proving	0.0
We re proving	We are proving that we wanted to make  sure that when you divide it into thirds there s no left over  or anything so we can actually	4.0
You can do anyone you want	I m doing this one	0.0
I m doing this one	Three meters and I used this	3.0
Three meters and I used this	I got 39  plus 39 plus 39 and	3.0
Is that exact	Two meters	3.0
Is it exactly 114 inches	Would this be 4	0.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Do you buy that	Uh well which one is she doing	0.0
Blue ribbon the first one		3.0
	Yeah 4	3.0
Do you see why	Oh yeah I know why	0.0
Oh yeah I know why	I think I know why	0.0
Yeah why	Well one meter is say approximately three feet without any  inches	4.0
Well one meter is say approximately three feet without any  inches	Say it was just plain 3 feet then and if there was  two meters would be two meters would be approximately  about 12 feet no 6 feet 6 feet put together	4.0
Approximately	Yeah approximately not exactly	3.0
Yeah approximately not exactly	And if it was 6 feet and  each one was a half then it d be then half of three would  just be like saying one and a half another one and a half  and that ll fill up three	4.0
And if it was 6 feet and  each one was a half then it d be then half of three would  just be like saying one and a half another one and a half  and that ll fill up three	Then for the other three one and a  half one and a half	4.0
So how many is that all together		3.0
Is that the way you thought about  it	No	0.0
How did you do it	I just thought if it is two meters and each is a half two  halves are in a whole	4.0
So two halves make a whole	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then there s 2 meters so I got 4	4.0
Do you have to do that	No	0.0
Try it for the  gold ribbon	It would be six	3.0
It would be six	Six	3.0
Six	No wait it d be eight	3.0
No wait it d be eight	But it says there s two four six	1.0
But it says there s two four six	Yeah it d be six	3.0
Yeah it d be six	Six meters	3.0
Make sense	Yeah I get it	0.0
Yeah I get it	Six meters	3.0
Six meters	What about the rest of it	0.0
You re on a roll now	It d be twelve	3.0
So is there is there a rule here	There s two in one meter which is approximately three  feet there are two halves	4.0
There s two in one meter which is approximately three  feet there are two halves	In another one there are two  halves	4.0
In another one there are two  halves	Another one there are two halves etc	4.0
Another one there are two halves etc	And so if you  keep counting by two up to six meters that s be twelve  meters	4.0
Ready to go on	This keeps  going	3.0
It s one so it s one	One meter and it s two meters	3.0
How do you know if it s true or not	Well it says two meters but do we have to get another one  of these	0.0
Can you just use this one to measure	This you could	0.0
Can you find some way to do that	Yes I think	0.0
Ok let s put  together and then you try to stretch it	It s three	3.0
It s three	We ll have to pretend that s  right	0.0
We ll have to pretend that s  right	Ok so	0.0
So the first questions is	One half of a meter	3.0
One half of a meter	One half of one meter or two meters	2.0
So now we use one half meter we can make how many  bows we can make	Two well would it be four	3.0
Last time we  had	Two	3.0
Now we have two meters	Four yeah	3.0
The reason being	Well you have to double that because now that there s  double that now it s two meters so	4.0
And in two meters how many half meter we have	A half meter we have two	3.0
In one meter how many half meters we have	Well we can make two we have one	3.0
I said in one meter how many half meters we have	Is that like	0.0
Half meter 50	One two one no that would be two	3.0
Now in two meters how many half meters we have	Four	3.0
Now we have two meters right	Yup	0.0
The one we spent lots of time last time	Three meter	3.0
Three meter	That would be I think that would be five	3.0
Why five	Well because we just added one bow to that side oh no  now it d be six	4.0
Well because we just added one bow to that side oh no  now it d be six	Six	1.0
Ok so why s that	Because you re doubling you re doubling like last time  was three and three plus three is six	4.0
Because you re doubling you re doubling like last time  was three and three plus three is six	And now I think that  would be 8 the next one	4.0
And now I think that  would be 8 the next one	And that would be 10	4.0
What about the last one	Oh they added one this time so	4.0
If I fold it this like this and then I  measure it like this this is half of two meters right	That would be one meter	3.0
But if I do this I make into three equal lengths then I  measure it what that would be	I think it d be a half	3.0
I think it d be a half	Well it would be	0.0
Right	Four	3.0
Four	We need three right	3.0
Right here we say twothirds	How would you make three	2.0
How would you make three	That s four	3.0
We have cut one meter into three equal lengths right	Put it up against this and see what it would come to	0.0
Put it up against this and see what it would come to	Not  exactly	3.0
Yeah but roughly	Thirtythree	3.0
Remember what we did last time about onethird of a meter	Yeah I don t	0.0
But then what I just  did a third	It would come to thirtythree	3.0
So how can you get twothirds from  here	Well that came to  so then you get	0.0
What is twothirds	Two one thirds	3.0
Add them together	That would be um sixtysix	3.0
Add two one	Sixtysix	3.0
Sixtysix right	And that would equal up to here	3.0
Convince me	It s double	3.0
It s double	Its one half meter	1.0
Its one half meter	This is two meters	4.0
This is two meters	so one half of one meter would be two	4.0
so one half of one meter would be two	And this is  two meters so another half of a meter would be plus the  other half would be four	4.0
And this is  two meters so another half of a meter would be plus the  other half would be four	So that would explain why four  bows	4.0
So that would explain why four  bows	Yeah what he s saying is you have this	1.0
Yeah what he s saying is you have this	This acts as four	3.0
Why acts as four	This	0.0
Why does this act as four	Because this acts as two	4.0
Because this acts as two	Well yeah this	1.0
Why does this act as two	Because we re saying this is a half	4.0
Because we re saying this is a half	You cut this in half	4.0
You cut this in half	You have two parts	4.0
You have two parts	So you put that up to it  and it s two	4.0
So you put that up to it  and it s two	And then you need   this is a  half of that	4.0
And then you need   this is a  half of that	So you need one more and that s  four	4.0
So you need one more and that s  four	So then this can act as three as cutting it into thirds	4.0
So then this can act as three as cutting it into thirds	Is  putting sixthirds up to twothirds	4.0
Is  putting sixthirds up to twothirds	But this two meters is  the whole so actually this	4.0
But this two meters is  the whole so actually this	If two meters is the whole then  this is the half	4.0
If two meters is the whole then  this is the half	This is almost like rods	0.0
This is almost like rods	We don t have  every one though	0.0
We don t have  every one though	This is the whole	4.0
This is the whole	This is the half	4.0
This is the half	We  have another one a half	4.0
Um if  you have the blue ribbon and we want to figure out how  many bows we could make and each one is a half a meter  how did you figure out first you told me it was two and then  you said no it s four	It s four because	3.0
It s four because	It could be either way	1.0
Could it be either	I don t know	0.0
I don t know	That one would be half of two meters	3.0
That one would be half of two meters	So one half of two meters not one half of one meter	1.0
And the question is how many bows can  you get out of that blue ribbon if each bow is gonna be a  half a meter long	Four cause this is going to be two meters long	4.0
Four cause this is going to be two meters long	But its saying it s a half of two meters	1.0
Let me see if I can understand what James is saying	But its saying it s a half of two meters because the blue  ribbon here is two meters is the whole so then this is half of  two meters that would only be two	4.0
What is a half a  meter	One half of one of these	3.0
One half of one of these	Yes four	1.0
Yes four	That would be four and this would be	3.0
That would be four and this would be	This would be two	1.0
This would be two	One of these would go up against them	4.0
One of these would go up against them	And that would be two halves and another one you put on  and that would be four	4.0
If you took your  white ribbon and cut it in half how long would each bow  be	Each bow	0.0
How long is that white ribbon	100 meters so it would be 50	3.0
100 meters so it would be 50	100 centimeters	1.0
100 centimeters	Centimeters So it would be right	1.0
Centimeters So it would be right	From there to there	4.0
From there to there	Then you cut it in half it would be two	4.0
If this is a meter how long would each  ribbon be	It would be 50 centimeters	3.0
And in terms	These two are halves	3.0
Halves of what	Of one meter	3.0
Ok so now my  question	You can fit four of them in the blue	3.0
How do you  know you can fit four of them in the blue	Well you can fit two of these in the blue	4.0
Well you can fit two of these in the blue	Then you cut that  in half	4.0
Then you cut that  in half	That s two	4.0
That s two	So you have two in one	4.0
So you have two in one	Then you have  the other side	4.0
Then you have  the other side	That would be two and two is four	4.0
Let s see if James agrees	Yeah I do agree	1.0
You do agree	Yeah	1.0
What are you just doing now	I	0.0
What did you do	I put the   50 centimeters	3.0
I put the   50 centimeters	Yeah so if you put that up to	1.0
Can I hold the other side for  you so that it ll stay stretched out	Is the dot here yeah there s the crease	3.0
You need another finger here	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So where the crease is is where it would be cut	3.0
So where the crease is is where it would be cut	So  that s two	3.0
Let s see	It s two	3.0
Ok so out of this big blue ribbon we can make bows  that are a half a meter long and how many bows did you  get	Four	3.0
Ok	And then with the third we were trying to figure out to be a  third of a bow	3.0
Yeah	We thought it was sixty but	3.0
Ok what this is saying again and I think just to  understand what it is asking is they want to know if you  start with this big blue ribbon again how many bows could  you make if each bow is a third of a meter long	Six	3.0
What do you think	Six	3.0
Tell me why	Because there are three three	4.0
You don t have to do it if you can  explain it to me	It would be three thirds in this so if you put three on one side	4.0
It would be three thirds in this so if you put three on one side	and three on the other side	4.0
Ok so you think you re gonna get six ribbons that  are a half of a meter  a third of a meter long from that big  blue ribbon	Yeah	0.0
T3 How about from the blue ribbon if you wanted to  make bows that are a quarter of a meter	Eight	3.0
Eight	Eight	1.0
Eight	Because maybe we can a half of the half is a fourth	4.0
Because maybe we can a half of the half is a fourth	Since there s two halves it d be two four four on one side  four on the other so it would be eight	4.0
Since there s two halves it d be two four four on one side  four on the other so it would be eight	It would be eight	1.0
Ok you re both agreeing on that	Yes	1.0
Yes	The same for fifths	3.0
What would be for fifths	It would be	0.0
It would be	ten	4.0
ten	Because it would be five on one side  and five on the other	4.0
Now you want to cut  bows that are two thirds meters long	That s where we were	0.0
That s where you were left	Ok alright let s try this again	0.0
Ok alright let s try this again	Put that over there	0.0
You re gonna hold it for him	I ll hold it right here	0.0
I ll hold it right here	We were thinking it has to be somewhere between 71 and  60	4.0
We were thinking it has to be somewhere between 71 and  60	Because we tried 60 and we tried 71 and 71 was over  and 60 was less so we came down and we were trying 69	4.0
Because we tried 60 and we tried 71 and 71 was over  and 60 was less so we came down and we were trying 69	So it would be 69	4.0
So it would be 69	And then 138	1.0
And then 138	138 and 69 is	3.0
138 and 69 is	It s over	3.0
It s over	So we ll try 68	3.0
So we ll try 68	68 and 68 is 136	4.0
68 and 68 is 136	68 is over	3.0
68 is over	Wait no yeah it over	4.0
Wait no yeah it over	So it s  about 105	4.0
You are working with these numbers I didn t  hear you working with the numbers before	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	That s because the thirds We didn t actually find the  thirds yet	4.0
That s because the thirds We didn t actually find the  thirds yet	And this is saying two thirds	4.0
And this is saying two thirds	So it s kind of  harder	0.0
So it s kind of  harder	Because the length of the third is 33	4.0
Because the length of the third is 33	It would be  36	4.0
It would be  36	I mean 66	3.0
I mean 66		3.0
		1.0
	Yeah 32	1.0
Yeah 32	Only 98	3.0
Only 98		3.0
		3.0
	66 and a half	1.0
66 and a half	66 and half	1.0
66 and half		3.0
		1.0
	Yeah 33	1.0
Yeah 33		3.0
	Yeah	1.0
Confused again	It s 199 not 200	3.0
It s 199 not 200	We want it to be 200 right	0.0
We want it to be 200 right	Yeah but this is 200	1.0
Yeah but this is 200	We re talking about	0.0
We re talking about	We counted this  and then 120 120 133 plus 60 is 290	4.0
We counted this  and then 120 120 133 plus 60 is 290	66 and a half and 33 and that makes 99 and a half	4.0
66 and a half and 33 and that makes 99 and a half	199 and a half	1.0
199 and a half	Hold on let me try 67 67 134 yeah	3.0
Hold on let me try 67 67 134 yeah	Yeah 134	1.0
Yeah 134	That s 67	3.0
That s 67	It s one over	3.0
What are you trying to figure out	We re trying to figure out a third of blue	3.0
Tell me what kind of ribbon are you trying to cut  now from this big blue ribbon	We re trying to cut	3.0
How long is going to be the ribbon you re going to  be cutting	Two thirds of one meter	3.0
Ok and want do we want to find out	If it s two thirds of one meter that would be that would be	0.0
Just tell me what the question is so I know that you  know what you re working on	It s two thirds of one meter	3.0
What s two thirds of a meter	So it s two meters and two thirds of a meter the number of  bows	3.0
James what are you trying to find out	I think it s four	3.0
But what s the question just so  I know you know what you re working on	It s how many	0.0
It s how many	Two thirds	3.0
Two thirds	How many two thirds lengths bows can you make of two  meters	2.0
Ok so how many bows are you going to cut from  this blue ribbon if each bow is going to be how big	Two thirds	3.0
Two thirds of a meter right	Yeah	0.0
Ok	So one third is 33	3.0
So one third is 33		3.0
	33 66 so that s two	4.0
33 66 so that s two	Three you actually have two meters  left over I mean two thirds left over	4.0
What do you mean you have two thirds leftover	Because if you want to make take two thirds and there s  three thirds so take two thirds plus two thirds plus one third  and one third you have two more thirds	4.0
Say it again	There s three thirds so there s two  thirds and one third and one third that s two thirds and you  still have one two thirds left over	4.0
This is real interesting	So then there s one third and two  thirds is two thirds so then here s the half	4.0
So then there s one third and two  thirds is two thirds so then here s the half	So you only have one third so then you have to get  the other third	4.0
So you only have one third so then you have to get  the other third	This is two  thirds so then you have two more thirds left over	4.0
What did he just say	He s saying that there s six meters	1.0
He s saying that there s six meters	There are two meters	1.0
This blue ribbon is two meters uh huh	Yeah And there are six meters is in  each and it would be two thirds is one two thirds is again  and two thirds left	4.0
Can you picture that white  ribbon over there if we took it and divided it into thirds	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then it would be you divide this	4.0
And then it would be you divide this	This one and this one  around here would be a half	4.0
This one and this one  around here would be a half	Like right there would be half  because this is the whole now	4.0
Like right there would be half  because this is the whole now	So then it would be one  third two thirds three thirds	4.0
Which ribbon am I looking at	The white	3.0
The white	This whole thing is the blue ribbon and this is the white	1.0
What did you divide it into  over here	Thirds	3.0
Thirds ok	It would be a third of 33 66 99	3.0
You just divided it into thirds and what did you end  up with over here	Two  I ended up with um two thirds	4.0
Two  I ended up with um two thirds	That would be that  would be one and one third but you had two thirds left over	4.0
Ok you re saying that if you take that white ribbon  and divide it up into thirds how many thirds would you get  if you took that white ribbon and divided it into thirds	Three	3.0
What do you think James	Yeah three	1.0
And what about from your finger  over to here if you took this white ribbon and divided it up	Three	3.0
Ok now but what Andrew was saying which I think  is real interesting is  you re trying to make your bows that  are how long	Two thirds of a meter	3.0
How  how many ribbons could you make from  this	I have to go	0.0
How many ribbons were you able to  cut from this big blue ribbon	Two	3.0
You think you could only get two bows that are two  thirds	No three	1.0
No three	Four	1.0
Four	I think three	1.0
I think three	Why three if you have two thirds and two thirds	2.0
Why three if you have two thirds and two thirds	You have two third and two thirds and  then there are six and this is two thirds and this is two thirds  would be one two three yeah four	4.0
You have two third and two thirds and  then there are six and this is two thirds and this is two thirds  would be one two three yeah four	One two no three  one	4.0
One two no three  one	I know but two thirds	1.0
I know but two thirds	Andrew I know but half is	1.0
Andrew I know but half is	So two thirds of this two thirds of the white then you have  two thirds of the white ribbon then two thirds of the white  ribbon right	4.0
So two thirds of this two thirds of the white then you have  two thirds of the white ribbon then two thirds of the white  ribbon right	And there if you have one more third and one  more third of the white and there if you have one more third  and one more third of the white and then you have two  thirds left over going that way or going that way	4.0
So how many ribbons could you cut that are two  thirds long	Four	3.0
From this blue ribbon	Yeah	0.0
Kelly	Well you re supposed to like  there s one meter of white  ribbon and then you have to split it into um a half so I got  um two bows	4.0
Caitlin	Three	3.0
Can you prove it	Well we have one meter so you take one and there s two in  one	4.0
I see that how did you do that	Then it s one third so you divide it into thirds and you  would get three	4.0
Kimberly	She folded it three times	1.0
It s three  pieces right	Two but it came out	1.0
And Jackie	We did it at first then we forgot how we did it	0.0
Class	Three	3.0
Danielle	Four	3.0
How many times did you fold it Danielle	Twice	3.0
Kelly what do you think	We can measure it	3.0
Graham	Well you could take four of these and put them up together on a meter stick and see  if they fit together	3.0
Class	Four	3.0
Erin	Five	3.0
Caitlin	I think that each time it goes up one	4.0
I think that each time it goes up one	Like one two it went  up one for one meter	4.0
Like one two it went  up one for one meter	Then so two would be three and three  would be four and four would be five	4.0
What do you think Brian	How I got them was I divided all of them by one	4.0
How I got them was I divided all of them by one	And I got  mostly when it said one third I got three bows	4.0
You re telling me if you  have one meter and if you re dividing it by one half what  did you get	I d get two bows	3.0
If you had one  meter length and divided it by one third what did you get	Three bows	3.0
And what was the next one class	One fourth	3.0
One divided by one quarter was	Four	3.0
What do you think Kelly	There s a pattern	3.0
What do you mean	Well each time you have one that like one half came out to  two then one third came out to three one fourth came  out  came out to four and one fifth came out to five so  there s like a pattern because with the ones and so you like  you look over here and you could see because the one and  the two you could really see that it comes out to two bows	4.0
Graham	Maybe ten	3.0
Kimberly	I think that it would be ten but they would be very very  tiny	3.0
Andrew	Well I think if you re making one half of a meter and two  meters there would be four bows	4.0
How can you convince me that that s true	Well the reason why it would be four bows is because it  says one half of one meter and there s two meters and so  you have the blue rod and you take see you put a white rod  up to it I mean ribbon and you put two you put one white  ribbon up to it and it equals one half	4.0
Well the reason why it would be four bows is because it  says one half of one meter and there s two meters and so  you have the blue rod and you take see you put a white rod  up to it I mean ribbon and you put two you put one white  ribbon up to it and it equals one half	And then another one and it equals  the other half so two whites go into a blue	4.0
And then another one and it equals  the other half so two whites go into a blue	So then since  this is one meter and it s asking one half of one meter and  so you have a half of it is two on one half of the blue and  then two on the other half side of the blue so that s four  bows	4.0
Well what about so you re telling me that two  divided by one halfwhat did you say Andrew	Four	3.0
Brian	Six	3.0
How did you get six	Well there s two meters and in one meter there are three  thirds and in the other meter there are three thirds	4.0
Well there s two meters and in one meter there are three  thirds and in the other meter there are three thirds	In the  other meter there are three thirds	4.0
In the  other meter there are three thirds	So you add them	4.0
So you add them	In one  meter there are three third and the other meter there are  three thirds	4.0
In one  meter there are three third and the other meter there are  three thirds	If you add the two meters together it d be three  thirds and three thirds which is six	4.0
Andrew it sounded very much like  the way you did the other one	Yeah	0.0
Good for you  Brian	I did the same thing on all of them like I did on the white	4.0
I did the same thing on all of them like I did on the white	I  would times the two by whatever like the one third	4.0
I  would times the two by whatever like the one third	Say  two times three is six	4.0
So you re telling me you got that because two times three is  six	Right	0.0
Erin	I got three bows	3.0
Andrew	I got four	3.0
Brian	I have three	3.0
Kelly	Well I think three because well it s just the same as the  other one	4.0
Well I think three because well it s just the same as the  other one	You like you take this and you divide it in three  pieces and you get three	4.0
What s the  length of each of those pieces	Two thirds	3.0
How can you convince  us each piece is two thirds	You can measure it	3.0
What do you  think	If this is two thirds it would be right here	4.0
If this is two thirds it would be right here	This is one third and that s two thirds then three  thirds	4.0
Gregory you like that Gregory	One then two wait hold on	0.0
Yes thank you very much	You have the blue and you have this is and you take you  have a white	4.0
Ok this is two meters right	Yeah you have a white so that is half of this	4.0
Ok right I got that	The white is three and then the other white is three	4.0
The white is three and then the other white is three	So it s  asking you how many two thirds of one meter you would  take a third	4.0
You have six one third  meters so how many two third meters do you have	Well we have so you have two meters	3.0
Show me  where two thirds would be	Right there	3.0
So where would be the next two thirds	There	3.0
Would you get three or  four	You get so it would be one two wait  there s one two and three	4.0
You think three	I thought you see what I thought	0.0
What did you think	No I thought two thirds I thought you had to get two  thirds	3.0
No I thought two thirds I thought you had to get two  thirds	So you have two thirds two thirds so that s um	3.0
So you have two thirds two thirds so that s um	I  didn t count the last two thirds	4.0
So you counted  an extra two thirds	Yeah	0.0
Ok you re convinced of that	Yeah	0.0
Can you do it carefully to be sure that you can explain it  maybe	Yes	0.0
Jessica	Well I noticed that after a while like it started making a  pattern	4.0
Ok You want to say a little bit more about that	Well um I forget what pattern but I think it was going like  it started going in three six nine like  like when it said  when you had like different size ribbons and every time it  got like  like three times bigger and it kept doing it in all  different kinds of patterns I thought	4.0
Well um I forget what pattern but I think it was going like  it started going in three six nine like  like when it said  when you had like different size ribbons and every time it  got like  like three times bigger and it kept doing it in all  different kinds of patterns I thought	Yeah because at first it went two three four five	4.0
Yeah because at first it went two three four five	And then it went   Michael and the second one went uh the second one went four  eight something like four six yeah	4.0
I dont remember any two four six or four eight	No its four it s four six eight ten  and then there was  that odd and then there was that two thirds one	4.0
Ok lets lets let s hold out  Brian what were you just  saying	Well if we remember we had the three meters you would  always like times the number by three	4.0
Well if we remember we had the three meters you would  always like times the number by three	Like you go three  six nine	4.0
Michael	Uh one half	3.0
Is it shorter than this length	Uhh huh	0.0
Jessica what  do you imagine	Well I imagine if you like pull the ruler into like three  pieces and then it would be like like up to the um I think  wait um thirtythree mark I think	4.0
Well how how did you decide on the thirtythree mark	Well that s what I think because um um thirtythree plus  thirtythree plus thirtythree is ninety nine and that s   Michael No but there s a hundred   Jessica Yeah and then a hundred around like thirty three and like a  half almost	4.0
What do you think	Jackie your hand up partially	0.0
Something around that	I think there  it s thirtythree and one third because if you  take two more thirds you can get it to a hundred	4.0
Thirtythree and a third	Yeah	0.0
That what youre imagining so this	Im I m imagining it just being cut into three equal halves	3.0
A hundred what  here	A hundred centimeters	3.0
How do you know that	Because it only goes up to ninetynine but theres an extra  length that could be a centimeter	4.0
This piece over here	Mmm hmmm	0.0
So youre telling me there are a hundred  centimeters here and youre telling me that if you were to  make three equal parts Graham what do you think	Well theres ten decimeters	3.0
Ten decimeters well	Well thats ten centimeters and then theres ten decimeters	3.0
How do you get ten decimeters	Well theres well theres ten centimeters in a decimeter and  theres ten of them on that so it would go to a hundred	4.0
Well theres well theres ten centimeters in a decimeter and  theres ten of them on that so it would go to a hundred	What	2.0
What	Ten centimeters plus ten centimeters plus ten  centimeters is	4.0
Were going to hear Jessicas theory  now	Um	0.0
You  helped me with that and in faT2 you were very precise about  helping me with that and how many bows can you make	Um I think you could have made um oh I forget um	0.0
Why dont you all sit and talk to your partner for a minute  and confer and see what you think	What do you think I think	2.0
What do you think I think	How many	2.0
How many	I think its nine	3.0
I think its nine	I forget what I wrote on my paper	0.0
I forget what I wrote on my paper	Three meters so	3.0
Three meters so	Yeah you can make three bows	1.0
How many bows  can I make from three meters of ribbon	One third of a meter	4.0
One third of a meter	So if this  is a meter and  then	4.0
So if this  is a meter and  then	and then this is a meter then this is a meter	4.0
and then this is a meter then this is a meter	so this would be divided into thirds	1.0
so this would be divided into thirds	Three six nine	3.0
Three six nine	Yeah	1.0
Alright but a bow is going to be what do you think one  third of what	I think I thought in order to make bows I thought you can  make three of them	3.0
From one meter	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	From from here to here	3.0
Mmm hmm	For one meter and like like what I was saying like thirty  three and it would be somewhere arond there	3.0
Right but now I have three meters of ribbon	Three meters	3.0
Three meters	Oh three nine	3.0
Laura	Yeah  because three times three is nine	4.0
Yeah  because three times three is nine	Because three times three is nine	4.0
Ok James	Um Andrew  um we think um its nine and  theres nine in three meter sticks	3.0
Ok	That s what we think	0.0
Ok and you could persuade us everybody that that s the  case	Yeah	0.0
Ok	It would be  like	0.0
It would be  like	Can I ask Mrs Palmer	0.0
Can I ask Mrs Palmer	Can we ask Mrs Palmer if we could borrow her meter  sticks or no	0.0
So you think  right here is one	Yeah cuz	0.0
Right here	Yeah	0.0
Alright	And then the other one right there	3.0
And it s a third between Amy and  myself well how many to a meter then	Three	3.0
Three well how many to three meters	Nine	3.0
How did you get that	Three times three three times	3.0
Well is that right	I think so	1.0
I think so	Yeah	1.0
Well heres here s one meter stick and I have how many  how many bows from here	You have three meters in one and then three meters	3.0
You have three meters in one and then three meters	But doesnt it	0.0
Doesnt it what hon	I dont know	0.0
Alright well how many bows do you have here	Three	3.0
Three and how many meters is it	One	3.0
How many how many uhh bows do you have in this one	Three	3.0
So how many do you have to make two	Six	3.0
Here comes the third one how  many do you have here in this third one	Three	3.0
How many is that all together	Nine	3.0
Youre sure	Yeah	0.0
If you think you know your means then use it	Can we take our papers back and start um	0.0
Well you wont need it yet	Ok	0.0
Ok	Heres two  meters I mean one meter	3.0
You mean twentyseven three times is eighty one now tell  me what you did here	I did twenty I did seven times three and that equals this  never mind	3.0
Tell me what you did I want to know what you did Alan	Well its wrong anyway	3.0
Well what did you do though	I did I multiplied seven times three and got twenty one	4.0
Twentyone	And then I put the two up there added that times it and got  twelve now its wrong	4.0
Ok so that particular rule didn t work now what did you  do Kimberly	I did twentyseven times three	3.0
And how did you do it	I times twenty I times three times seven I got twentyone  so I carried the two then I did three times two and added  the two to my answer	4.0
Why does that work	Umm	0.0
I mean Alan showed me here three times  if you have three times twentyseven that means you have a  twentyseven three times and he proved to me that its  eightyone how does why does that work	because you add that	4.0
I dont understand why it works	Because youre basically doing is writing you have twenty seven three times	4.0
Mmm hmm	And then you get your answer eightyone	3.0
And then you get your answer eightyone	Its just youre just adding it faster	1.0
Does it always work	No	0.0
Doesnt always work	But it does sometimes	3.0
But Alans was different	Yeah	0.0
You know what it means  right	Yeah	0.0
Something to think about right	Yeah	0.0
Would it  work if you had twenty three times and seven three times	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Uh maybe uh I dont think so	1.0
But you think so	I dont think so	3.0
She doesnt think so you do	Yeah I do cuz you have twenty	1.0
Right	if you have seven three times	3.0
if you have seven three times	Add them together you d have to add them together	1.0
Ok right	You would have to add them together	3.0
What do you mean you have to  add them together Kimberly	You would have to add those two answers together to get	3.0
Why	Because if you wanted to do it faster	0.0
Here	Because you wouldnt be able to get the answer for this if  you were using this and you would try to get the answer  eightyone you wouldnt be able to get the answer unless  you added the two answers together	4.0
But why	I dont know	0.0
So those are the problems youre  working on I just want to be sure you know all know the  problems youre working on now	Ok now we have eightyone thats just extra	3.0
Ok now we have eightyone thats just extra	Nine you got nine right	3.0
Nine you got nine right	We got nine	3.0
We got nine	So did I	1.0
So did I	Lets get some paper to write this down on	0.0
Lets get some paper to write this down on	I like your sweatshirt	0.0
I like your sweatshirt	Guys this is math youre  on camera	0.0
Guys this is math youre  on camera	Youre on camera and youre like oh nice  sweatshirt	0.0
Youre on camera and youre like oh nice  sweatshirt	You can do that out at the playground	0.0
You can do that out at the playground	Guys are you on the first one	0.0
Guys are you on the first one	Seven times three and you get the twentyone	4.0
Seven times three and you get the twentyone	You add  the sixty and the twentyone and you get the eightyone	4.0
You add  the sixty and the twentyone and you get the eightyone	Now you get it	1.0
Now you get it	Neither do I	0.0
Neither do I	Got it	0.0
Got it	What Im doing is you have your twentyseven so you take  off the seven and you get and you only have twenty	4.0
What Im doing is you have your twentyseven so you take  off the seven and you get and you only have twenty	So  then you do twenty times three and you get sixty which  brings me to step two	4.0
So  then you do twenty times three and you get sixty which  brings me to step two	You dont have two so you have the  seven	4.0
You dont have two so you have the  seven	So you do seven times three and that equals twenty one	4.0
So you do seven times three and that equals twenty one	So you add the sixty and the twentyone and you get  eight one	4.0
So you add the sixty and the twentyone and you get  eight one	Ok	0.0
Ok	I think I got it	0.0
I think I got it	Alright I dont get it	0.0
Alright I dont get it	You still dont get it	1.0
You still dont get it	Ok Ill put it in a lot more words	0.0
Ok Ill put it in a lot more words	Cuz Im not sure about something	2.0
Cuz Im not sure about something	I  think were supposed to try make a rule for that	3.0
I  think were supposed to try make a rule for that	Not that one it was wrong	3.0
Not that one it was wrong	Ok  I m confused	2.0
Ok  I m confused	Ok you added twentyseven before you multiply you take  off the seven and then you get twenty	4.0
Ok you added twentyseven before you multiply you take  off the seven and then you get twenty	And then you have  twenty times three and that equals sixty	4.0
And then you have  twenty times three and that equals sixty	So then you go to  step two	4.0
So then you go to  step two	You dont have the two there anymore so you have  the seven	4.0
You dont have the two there anymore so you have  the seven	You do seven times three and that equals twenty one so you add your two answers and you get eighty one	4.0
You do seven times three and that equals twenty one so you add your two answers and you get eighty one	Got it	0.0
Got it	Good	0.0
Good	So	0.0
So	Ok what do we have to do now	0.0
Ok what do we have to do now	Ok what do we have to  do now	0.0
Ok what do we have to  do now	What do you want to do now	0.0
What do you want to do now	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	We finished the problem so	0.0
How much ribbon do you have	We have six thousand five hundred and sixty one yards um  meters of ribbon	3.0
Did you have a calculator check your computation	And right now were tying ourselves down to get nine  meters of ribbon	3.0
And right now were tying ourselves down to get nine  meters of ribbon	We re tying ourselves down	3.0
Literally Erik you re literally tying yourself down	Yay we got	0.0
Well did you figure it out Alan	For the strategy for the strategy	0.0
Tell me	Twentyseven meters	3.0
Ok Did you discuss it with Kimberly	Yeah	0.0
Did you both agree on this	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Finally she got it	1.0
Oh I cant wait	Yeah I got confused	0.0
Yeah I got confused	Alright so you have the twentyseven before you multiply  it and you take off the seven and you have twenty so then  you multiply twenty three times and you get sixty	4.0
Mmm hmm	And so you go to step two	4.0
And so you go to step two	Then you dont have the two  anymore and you only have the seven	4.0
Then you dont have the two  anymore and you only have the seven	And you multiply  seven times three and you get twentyone	4.0
And you multiply  seven times three and you get twentyone	So then step  three you add sixty and twentyone and get eightyone	4.0
Ok Ok  Now Im curious I was very intrigued by what  Kimberly used some kind of procedure here that I dont  quite understand but is there any way on the basis of what  you did you could make sense of what she did	Well	0.0
Can you suppose someone cause I dont understand why  this procedure works I understand what you explained to  me but I want to know why this works cuz this seems to  work too	It does work	3.0
But why does it work is my question to you	First can you explain the problem	0.0
First can you explain the problem	Ok well all it is is you have the twentyseven but on his  you took the seven away	4.0
Ok well all it is is you have the twentyseven but on his  you took the seven away	And all I did was multiply the  twentyseven and	4.0
And all I did was multiply the  twentyseven and	You did	1.0
You did	I multiplied it together instead of having to multiply it  separately and add them together	4.0
Ok but tell me how you multiplied it together	Ok	0.0
In other words tell me what you did what did you do when  you multiplied	Well I put twenty seven times three equals  so I I  times the seven and the three and I got twenty one	4.0
Ok so	I carried the two but	3.0
Is that a two	In multiplication you dont carry	3.0
Is that a two	Well I learned to do that	0.0
This is a one but my question  is is that a two	Yeah but why do you have the two up there	2.0
Yeah but why do you have the two up there	Because two   because two added to two times three equals six you had  hold it two times two two plus two	4.0
Because two   because two added to two times three equals six you had  hold it two times two two plus two	No what I learned to do was	0.0
No what I learned to do was	times three equals twelve	3.0
times three equals twelve	What I learned to do was do was multiplication then you  add that to your multiplication answer	4.0
This is two tens I learned	But what I learned is you put the one there and then you  carry the two like you do in adding but you times the  number so I times three times two and then whatever you  got as your multiplication answer you added that number to  that and you put and then once you got there you got your  answer	4.0
I understand that but I want to know why it works	I dont know why	0.0
Alan	Well what she is doing is she multiplied seven times three  and got twentyone	4.0
Well what she is doing is she multiplied seven times three  and got twentyone	She carried the two and added those  and multiplied it twice	4.0
Ok well you gotta think about that one	But wait	0.0
But wait	But	0.0
Im not saying I dont agree  that it works but I dont know why it works	Kim you might have to rephrase your number problem  here	4.0
Kim you might have to rephrase your number problem  here	Because what youre doing is your doing seven times  three is twentyone youre carrying that and you only  multiply every number by two	4.0
Because what youre doing is your doing seven times  three is twentyone youre carrying that and you only  multiply every number by two	Maybe I should divide it into steps or something	3.0
Maybe I should divide it into steps or something	If you can explain it that way	1.0
If you can explain it that way	I think I can	3.0
I think I can	Alright put it in steps	1.0
Alright put it in steps	Let me try	0.0
Let me try	And then Ill read your	0.0
And then Ill read your	Alright I have an idea I gonna put it a little bit like that  ok	0.0
Alright I have an idea I gonna put it a little bit like that  ok	No I keep making messing up	3.0
No I keep making messing up	I m gonna do  it my own way	0.0
I m gonna do  it my own way	I keep making mistakes on this	3.0
I keep making mistakes on this	You want me to get a calculator	0.0
You want me to get a calculator	No	0.0
No	Alright go use a calculator	0.0
Alright go use a calculator	No I got it I got it	0.0
No I got it I got it	Where is x	0.0
Where is x	Ok ok ok I only have one little step hold on hold on	0.0
Ok ok ok I only have one little step hold on hold on	Alright step one twentyseven times three equals sixty  one	4.0
Alright step one twentyseven times three equals sixty  one	What	2.0
What	No come here	0.0
No come here	Look see this right here	0.0
Look see this right here	If you I brought  that over	4.0
If you I brought  that over	And then you do that you do those and then you  do that if you didnt if that number didnt exist youd have  sixtyone but then you take that and you add that two but  that two becomes a twenty and then you add it	4.0
And then you do that you do those and then you  do that if you didnt if that number didnt exist youd have  sixtyone but then you take that and you add that two but  that two becomes a twenty and then you add it	So I I cant  explain this problem	0.0
So I I cant  explain this problem	I can t explain how I did it I just  know how to do it that way	0.0
I can t explain how I did it I just  know how to do it that way	Wait lets see	0.0
Wait lets see	I know that twentyseven times three equals  eighty one	4.0
I know that twentyseven times three equals  eighty one	Right	1.0
Right	It says right here	0.0
It says right here	Right	0.0
Right	And if you do twentyseven times four it only equals it  equals one oh nine	4.0
And if you do twentyseven times four it only equals it  equals one oh nine	Right there I typed that in	0.0
Right there I typed that in	Anyway  um twentyseven equals so theres your eightyone	3.0
Anyway  um twentyseven equals so theres your eightyone	Now  the way youre doing it cant be done on the calculator	1.0
Now  the way youre doing it cant be done on the calculator	I know	0.0
I know	Youre ignoring the two	1.0
Youre ignoring the two	Forget that two	0.0
Twentyseven	Twentyseven	3.0
Ok show me how you did three times twentyseven and got  seventyeight	We just kept on adding	3.0
Well rather than adding three is there another  way you can do it	Times	3.0
You said you could have twenty  you said you could add three twentyseven times	Yeah	0.0
What does three times  twentyseven mean	Three times twentyseven thats seventyeight	4.0
Show me	I did	0.0
What does it mean to have three times twentyseven	Twentyseven three times	3.0
Ok thats true	Eighty one	3.0
Seventyeight is that possible	Twentyseven three times	3.0
You kept adding threes	No I guess we counted wrong	3.0
Maybe you added twentysix times	Yeah that would be eighty one and that number would be  eightyone	3.0
How do  you multiply three times twentyseven	Uh	0.0
Can you show me how to do that	What do we have to do	2.0
Three times twentyseven	Yeah and then you get eightyone	3.0
Laura	Yeah	1.0
Three times twentyseven what did you do there	First I did three times seven is twentyone put down a two	3.0
First I did three times seven is twentyone put down a two	Carry the two	1.0
Carry the two	and then three times two is six plus two is seven I mean  eight	4.0
and then three times two is six plus two is seven I mean  eight	And you get eightyone	4.0
What does that mean the twentyone	The twentyone means that you re seven fourteen twenty one that youre taking the seven	4.0
The twentyone means that you re seven fourteen twenty one that youre taking the seven	Youre taking the seven three times	1.0
Youre taking the seven three times	Three times	1.0
What does twenty one mean	Twentyone means that two times	3.0
Ok	Yeah like if you have like last year we were doing about  these things and they were like ten blocks in there and then  we had two of them	3.0
Oh ok yeah two tens	And then we had the one	3.0
Ok so Im confused when you say carry the two youre not  carrying two of these	No were carrying two tens	3.0
What does this  carrying the two mean	Because	0.0
What are you thinking	I was thinking it would be alright because this this two is  in the tens column	4.0
Does  that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Do you think you can explain it	Yeah	0.0
Because some people dont know why that works so I want  you to think about that	And that	0.0
Ok	Because two is in the tens column and so is that so	4.0
Because two is in the tens column and so is that so	Yeah I know	1.0
Yeah I know	So it would be so its like youre carrying  two tens	3.0
So it would be so its like youre carrying  two tens	Yeah and plus two tens	1.0
Yeah and plus two tens	Now lets keep doing this	0.0
Now lets keep doing this	How many were we up to	2.0
How many were we up to	Well we have to change that to an eightyone	3.0
Well we have to change that to an eightyone	How much wait	2.0
How much wait	You have to change this	3.0
You have to change this	Change it to an eightyone	3.0
Change it to an eightyone	Now lets go see how much eightyone meters is outside	3.0
Now lets go see how much eightyone meters is outside	Why	2.0
Why	Now I now I have to change this to an eightyone	3.0
Now I now I have to change this to an eightyone	What	2.0
What	This	3.0
This	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	This	3.0
This	Now we gotta do this eightyone times	3.0
Now we gotta do this eightyone times	Ok keep working	0.0
Ok keep working	What were we up to	2.0
What were we up to	Ok thats thirtythree down there	3.0
Ok thats thirtythree down there	And thats thirtythree	3.0
And thats thirtythree	Its thirtythree too	3.0
Its thirtythree too	Its sixty six	4.0
Its sixty six	Because its thirtythree  here and thirtythree here sixtysix	4.0
Because its thirtythree  here and thirtythree here sixtysix	Fiftyseven fiftyeight fiftynine sixty	0.0
Fiftyseven fiftyeight fiftynine sixty	Sixty now Im going to go to  the next page	3.0
Sixty now Im going to go to  the next page	I guess right	0.0
I guess right	Ok	0.0
Ok	Two for every meter	3.0
Ok and	That means if you had  divided by how many  other meters you have but I think you should do two times  wait if you have eightyone meters and you want to find  out how many ribbons should be in that you know that two  ribbons can be made out of each meter	4.0
Ok	So that means two times eightyone and your answer is one  hundred and sixtytwo which is obviously the answer youd  have to give	4.0
Mmm hmmm Ok what did Kim what if instead	If you had a thousand	3.0
Then what would you do	That would be times four	3.0
Why does multiplying by two or  three or four work	Uh because uh thats the num thats the its like a four  and if youre using um a fourth and you use four its sort of  like youre just using regular numbers	4.0
Ok so if I have one meter of ribbon and they were a fourth  of a meter how many bows could I make	Four	3.0
Do you agree with that	eight twelve	3.0
eight twelve	So that would be if you had eight one and then you d have  to multiply that by four you get three hundred and twenty four bows	4.0
Three hundred and twentyfour bows if I had eightyone  meters of ribbon	Ok	0.0
Ok	Three hundred and twentyfour meters would be the entire  perimeter of this school	3.0
Wow are you up to measuring that out	No aT2ually this long hall is eightytwo so it would be only  one meter less than that	4.0
No aT2ually this long hall is eightytwo so it would be only  one meter less than that	So if you would do it again you would have one thousand  two hundred thirtysix	4.0
Ok	Times four	3.0
Times four	If you use the answer of eightyone times four  youd get I dont know	3.0
If you use the answer of eightyone times four  youd get I dont know	Youd just keep going and then  divide it by the number of	3.0
Youd just keep going and then  divide it by the number of	In this	0.0
The calculators not going past a million	The calculator quit	0.0
You need a bigger calculator	No the calculator quit it said error	0.0
Do you feel better about  being able to explain this	I think so	0.0
Can you try it can you praT2ice on me before she asks you  to explain this	I don t think I can	0.0
Yes you can	Oh I could tell you how I could explain mine	0.0
Ok Kim why does this work	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	I m confused that s why I can t do it	2.0
Well you just told me some beautiful things about all the  patterns and relationships here	Well I m confused	2.0
Well I m confused	It  quit	0.0
Ok How far did you go	We went up to three point eight seven four two six four  eight	3.0
You have  twentyseven times three is eightyone	Twentyseven times three is eightyone but if and if you  have one meter and it was times four by fourths you get  four bows and if it was by thirds you get three bows so the  third or the fourth would be three or four	4.0
Beth Laura and Jessica may have figured out  Alan why that why Kimberly s algorithm works	Well	0.0
I understand you got it by multiplying by 3	We got an answer	0.0
We got an answer	She asked us what what would you get  how many bows would you get if you had three times nine  and we got twentyseven and she said how many bows  would you get if it was three twentyseven	0.0
Ok so this is how much ribbon you have	Yeah	0.0
You have twentyseven meters of ribbon	Right	0.0
Ok and tell me again why youre multiplying by three	Because she said how many ribbons can you make out of  twentyseven meters out of um if youre making three  thirds	0.0
If youre making a third ok I understand that perfeT2ly  well I think youre fine	But I m confused	1.0
Its kind of a hard  idea	Yeah	0.0
Yeah I think thats what it is	Its easy to learn it but its hard to explain it	0.0
ok	Carrying the two	3.0
Carrying the two	Now what is your way of doing  that	2.0
Now what is your way of doing  that	You multiplied the three times what Kim did is she  multiplied the three times the seven and then carried the two  up there	4.0
You multiplied the three times what Kim did is she  multiplied the three times the seven and then carried the two  up there	Right but	0.0
Right but	We carried because that s	3.0
We carried because that s	Just show me how you did yours	0.0
Just show me how you did yours	Thats I did the same thing as Kimberly	1.0
Thats I did the same thing as Kimberly	I know but	0.0
I know but	And it works because this two is ten and that two is ten and  when you add them	4.0
And it works because this two is ten and that two is ten and  when you add them	Its forty	1.0
Its forty	No because you do three times two	1.0
No because you do three times two	Right and that would be six	1.0
Right and that would be six	And then plus two more	1.0
And then plus two more	Is eight	1.0
Is eight	Right	1.0
Right	But wait what youre doing is youre only multiplying that  two and adding that twenty onto that youre not multiplying  that two	4.0
But wait what youre doing is youre only multiplying that  two and adding that twenty onto that youre not multiplying  that two	What youre doing is youre just adding that onto  there	4.0
What youre doing is youre just adding that onto  there	Youre not multiplying that two	4.0
Youre not multiplying that two	You re not supposed to	1.0
You re not supposed to	Youre not supposed to youre not	1.0
Youre not supposed to youre not	you have you learned that last year right	0.0
you have you learned that last year right	And you had  Ms Firestone right	0.0
And you had  Ms Firestone right	Then I know why youre getting a  different answer than him	1.0
Then I know why youre getting a  different answer than him	He had  and I had  Warwick and you had Firestone	0.0
He had  and I had  Warwick and you had Firestone	So maybe Warwick and  Firestone taught the same thing but  didn t	0.0
So maybe Warwick and  Firestone taught the same thing but  didn t	So  that s why Alan s confused and we know what we re doing	1.0
So  that s why Alan s confused and we know what we re doing	Well I made up one of mine and this is what I did	0.0
Well I made up one of mine and this is what I did	First  you have your um twentyseven then you take off the seven  and you only have twenty	4.0
First  you have your um twentyseven then you take off the seven  and you only have twenty	So you multiply twenty by three  and you get sixty	4.0
So you multiply twenty by three  and you get sixty	So then in the step two you only have  your seven left so you multiply seven times three and you  get twentyone	4.0
So then in the step two you only have  your seven left so you multiply seven times three and you  get twentyone	You add sixty and twentyone and you get  eightyone	4.0
It s a different way isn t it	Very different	3.0
Have you tried it for any other numbers to  see if it works	We did um we did um we can make out of nine meters  we can make twentyseven bows out of twentyseven  meters you can make eightyone bows and then out of  eightyone meters we got two hundred and twentyfourty  but nows its even so now we think its two hundred and  fourtythree	4.0
We did um we did um we can make out of nine meters  we can make twentyseven bows out of twentyseven  meters you can make eightyone bows and then out of  eightyone meters we got two hundred and twentyfourty  but nows its even so now we think its two hundred and  fourtythree	Yeah it is	1.0
Yeah it is	I got the same thing with the calculator	1.0
I got the same thing with the calculator	And we were  doing it like this	0.0
And we were  doing it like this	Yikes yikes yikes	0.0
Oh ok	So we must have made an error	3.0
What can I ask you I mean you probably have said this to  Dr Maher but I wasnt over here why are you multiplying  by three	Well because she asked us	0.0
Well because she asked us	The first problem that we had to do was if we had three  meters	0.0
Does it have to do with that three meters of ribbon	Cause you had to multiply it by the number of three by the  number of meters you had	4.0
Cause you had to multiply it by the number of three by the  number of meters you had	Because its a pattern or something	4.0
Ok its a pattern Im real	It just seems to be working	3.0
Im real confused though about why the three why why  multiply by three why not multiply by two	Because the problem was to only have three meters	4.0
Because the problem was to only have three meters	Right	1.0
Right	That wasnt the problem	1.0
Ok what if I had	Had it been two meters this would have only been	3.0
What if I had started with um six meters	Twentyseven times six	3.0
Ok and I wanted to make bows that were a third a meter	And twentysix	3.0
Six meters of ribbon	Hold it	0.0
Bows that were a third a meter in length each	Times three nine no	3.0
Times three nine no	Ok I got that too	3.0
Ok I got that too	I think its	0.0
Where did you get twentyseven from	We just did  only we pulled out the three and  put the six in we just doubled the three	4.0
We just did  only we pulled out the three and  put the six in we just doubled the three	Right all we did  was we kept the twentyseven but we just doubled the three	4.0
I dont want you to think about any of the past  stuff weve been working on today	Ok	0.0
Ok  New problem the problem is I have seven meters of  ribbon	Seven	3.0
How many bows would I get	Youd get twentyone	4.0
Youd get twentyone	Because seven times three is twenty one	4.0
Because seven times three is twenty one	Right	1.0
We started  with seven meters	Right so that would be seven times seven	3.0
Thats what I  dont understand	And youd get fortynine	3.0
And youd get fortynine	No	1.0
Ok now youre saying something different here ok why	So you multiply the number of meters you got by the  number by the fraT2ion youre making	3.0
So you multiply the number of meters you got by the  number by the fraT2ion youre making	The third is just like the three its like a regular number	3.0
Is it	It isnt its sort of used as a regular number but its really a  third	3.0
It isnt its sort of used as a regular number but its really a  third	Yeah what you do is you take the number of ribbon you  have and then make the fraT2ion the fraT2ion like one third  the three multiply the number of meters you have and then  you get your answer of how many bows can be made out of  them	4.0
Oh youre using some sort of a rule here	Yeah cause say I had fifty fifty meters and I wanted a  third of each of those meters	4.0
Yeah cause say I had fifty fifty meters and I wanted a  third of each of those meters	That would mean each meter  gets three parts so you multiply this by three and I get a  hundred and fifty so thats how many bows you can get	4.0
You ll have to say that again	AT2ually the fraT2ion that you have the second digit in  fraT2ion is the number you multiply the number of meters  that you have	4.0
AT2ually the fraT2ion that you have the second digit in  fraT2ion is the number you multiply the number of meters  that you have	That means if I had seven and I wanted to  divide it into fourths you go seven times four equals  twentyeight	4.0
So when you say the second number of the fraT2ion you  mean the number on the bottom in the fraT2ion	So the second number of the fraT2ion like it one fourth	3.0
Ok I see you have a slash line its the second number	The second number on the right side of the slash	3.0
The second number on the right side of the slash	And then  you multiply by the meters that youve got and then you get  your answer of how many bows can be made out of em	3.0
That seems to  work	Yeah	0.0
Class	Nine	3.0
So Danielle you dont know how to  prove it	Kind of	0.0
Sarah how would you prove  it	Um you go three	3.0
Were listening to the  proof gentlemen	You go three plus three plus three and that would equal  nine	4.0
You go three plus three plus three and that would equal  nine	And	0.0
And	Or three times	1.0
Or three times	Thats why because you have three meters and take  and  you have three one thirds in each meter so three three  threes and that equals nine	4.0
Jackie Danielle does that make any sense	I think its three meters times three meters equals nine  meters	4.0
Danielle do you agree or disagree	Yeah thats what I did	1.0
You think thats a good idea	Well you can times it but you can add it too	3.0
What are some  ways of doing this	Three times three	3.0
Erin	Uh we took string and went out in the hallway and  measured the nine meters out	3.0
You measured nine  bows or nine meters	Nine meters	3.0
Im confused we started with three meters	Ok um I didnt have to um measure it out	0.0
You didnt have to measure that one so that one you had  the three meters and what did you what was the question  you were asking you didnt have to measure it so how did  you do it	Um I did the first way umm three times three	3.0
Jackie	Well well see we had three meters so you put three down  and youre trying to divide it into thirds so you put another  three down and then you times it and that would equal up to  nine	4.0
Ok so youre telling me that in the one meter you have  three thirds is that what youre telling me	Mmm hmm	0.0
You didnt do it that way	No Im trying to think	0.0
Andrew	Well me and James did three times three like that and we  got the three and three because um you eventually have  three meters and so one third three so you have three thirds  of a meter so thats three thirds of a meter so thats three  times three meters equal nine meters nine meters	4.0
Well me and James did three times three like that and we  got the three and three because um you eventually have  three meters and so one third three so you have three thirds  of a meter so thats three thirds of a meter so thats three  times three meters equal nine meters nine meters	Yeah	0.0
Do you agree with that	Yeah	1.0
Is that when you measured it in the hall  Erin	Yeah	0.0
You had nine meters of  ribbon	Umm and we measured it out and um	3.0
So what did you do out in the hall we couldnt see you   What were you doing out there	Well um	0.0
So whats the question you measured out nine meters out  there and youre making bows how long were the bows	One third	3.0
Did you have one third meter string	Yeah	0.0
And how many of those one thirds	Twentyseven	3.0
What  did you do Mark	Well we measured out um yeah we measured twenty seven meters	3.0
You ended up with twentyseven of them	Yeah we	0.0
Erik We did we did it with Erin we did it with Erin	We did it with twentyseven meters	3.0
Those of you who did it  without measuring it Sarah what did you do	We timesed	3.0
You said nine divided by a third is the same as nine times  three	Yeah and then	0.0
Or twentyseven	Yeah and then we kept on timesing by three whatever the  answer was	3.0
How many bows can you make	We re using nine meters right	0.0
You have nine meters of ribbon and now your bows are  three meters in length	Ok you have nine meters of ribbon and your bows are  three meters in length	4.0
Ok you have nine meters of ribbon and your bows are  three meters in length	If you have wait yeah if you have  three meters all you have to do is multiply three times three  and you get nine meters because you if you have if each	4.0
Ok so how many can you make	You can make three three bows	3.0
So youre saying if I have nine meters and Im making them  three meters in length we could make three bows	Yes	0.0
David	I think the same thing because um if each one takes up  like a meter um nine divided by three that that would be  three ribbons	4.0
Each one takes up three meters	Yeah each one takes up three meters	3.0
Yeah each one takes up three meters	Oh yeah wait a minute um it would be its like three  times three would equal nine so uh nine divided by three  equals three um  its just because if you have three  plus three plus three so you can if each one takes up three  meters then you can make three bows out of nine	4.0
Oh yeah wait a minute um it would be its like three  times three would equal nine so uh nine divided by three  equals three um  its just because if you have three  plus three plus three so you can if each one takes up three  meters then you can make three bows out of nine	Because  you have three meters and then um alright one bow would  take up three so thered be six meters left another bow  would take up three so then there would be uh three meters  left and then thered be a third one and there wouldnt be  there wouldn t be any ribbon left	4.0
What you did and why	So whatever answer you did	0.0
So whatever answer you did	Whatever answers you did	0.0
Um well um Meredith its so  good to see you back and Meredith is probably  curious to know what we did and since you were able  to write to us to tell us what you did we have some  information Michael what did you want to say	Well weve been working with bows and discussing  like um well the length the how many bows we could  fit into a certain amount of meters if the bow took up a  certain amount of ribbon	4.0
Well weve been working with bows and discussing  like um well the length the how many bows we could  fit into a certain amount of meters if the bow took up a  certain amount of ribbon	And uh we were recently  doing thirds and uh we we got we got like stuff like we  came up with like you times nine times three or  something like that to get answers	4.0
Is a meter  longer than the width of this room	No	0.0
Is it shorter than the width of this room	Yes	0.0
Is a meter about the length of this chalkboard	No	0.0
Is it bigger	No	0.0
Is it smaller	Yes	0.0
Caitlin	I think its about this big	3.0
Is that going to be too long  or too short do you think	A little short	3.0
What do you think Brian	Yeah its a little its going to be a little short	3.0
Graham	You double it	3.0
Werent you also working on that  Gregory out in the hall with your yeah and can you  tell us can you tell the class something that would  give you an idea of the length of three meters nine  meters	Well just uh if like eight meters plus one meter	3.0
But if you had to tell someone here is like part of the  school about nine meters	Oh I guess maybe probably as big as the chalkboard  or a little bigger	3.0
Oh I guess maybe probably as big as the chalkboard  or a little bigger	Probably like from the chalkboard  from the end of the chalkboard to Danielle	3.0
Probably like from the chalkboard  from the end of the chalkboard to Danielle	No	1.0
You measured out something in the  hallway	Oh I know we measured the hallway	3.0
You measured the hallway and what did you find the  length of the hallway to be	Twentyseven meters	3.0
What do you think  Danielle	I think its bigger than	3.0
How many of you think that its  smaller	Because this is eight meters	4.0
How do you know that	Because we measured it	4.0
Because we measured it	When we were measuring the school	1.0
And you remember that	Yes	0.0
What  do you think	Well it would be about from the chalkboard to there	3.0
From the chalkboard to whom	Graham	3.0
Graham you agree	No	1.0
You think its too big too small	Too small	3.0
The width of the  classroom	Both	3.0
Both	Its eight by eight	3.0
Its eight by eight	Its eight by eight	1.0
It happens to be an eight by eight classroom	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Brian	Twentyseven meter hall comes to this hall coming  down here its about from the door to um to the  middle of to when you start going down there	3.0
David	I was going to say that um to the door the outside  door down to where you take a right	3.0
Oh so all the way where the interseT2ion is where you  can make a right Danielle	If you go right to the bathroom then you will go up	3.0
If you go into the bathroom ok thats very interesting  Michael	Also I think about the width of it is like a little bit away  from the wall and there um and all then to that wall	3.0
So if we started at that wall how much out of the  classroom would we have to go to get nine meters	One meter	3.0
How many of  them will I count out if I count them	Twentyseven	3.0
What was that	It was multiplying nine times three and you get  twentyseven	4.0
And you you took the one third meter and  you counted them how many of them when you  counted them up	You had well you had three	3.0
Three for each meter so for nine meters you had	Um you had nine	3.0
You had the three nine times	Yeah	0.0
Yeah how did you do that	You put the number down three times and you  counted	3.0
How many times did you  have three	Um	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight nine is that  right	Three	3.0
That added up to  Audra  We did the three three times and we added it up to  nine	We did the three three times and we added it up to nine	4.0
Remember that Erik	Yes	0.0
So we now have to help the people  who arent sure  no one thinks smaller	Come to think of it you could have you could have  three bows well I mean you could have each bow  thats three meters long and you can have one bow  that you have to twist and everything using three  meters of ribbon making it small and just like twisting it  every which way	4.0
So the question  is if I make my bows to be like this would my one  third meter bows that Im making for my nine meters  be smaller or bigger than my three meter bows that  Im making from my nine meter ribbon	The one third meter bow would probably be smaller  unless you had two different kinds of ribbon	3.0
But were not though were keeping them the same	But if you did then you could make this the three  meters really complicated bows so it is going to be  very little and that one basically	4.0
What do you think Brian	It would be in thirds	3.0
Ok so can you can you sort of tell me where one of  the first cuts would be if I rolled this ribbon on the floor  and it went out the room	Um on three meters	3.0
Audra	Um on six meters	3.0
Is there a third cut	No	0.0
Kimberly	Two	3.0
Erin	Three	3.0
Ok so how many bows will I make	Three	3.0
Is it going to be  more than nine meters	Yes	0.0
Its going to go past that hallway you  think	Mmm hmm	0.0
Now Im making my bows a half a  meter in length	A half meter	3.0
Two parts	Because half of 12 is 6	4.0
Because half of 12 is 6	You are not  paying attention	0.0
You are not  paying attention	We have it	0.0
How	Because we talked about it	0.0
Because we talked about it	Oh yeah because you double it	4.0
To the entire class If you solved that one also solve  the inaudible	I just made inaudible	0.0
To the entire class If you think you have a way of getting those answers if you found a secret on how to do it I would like to know what the secret is	2 meters is six	3.0
2 meters is six	6 is 3 times 12	4.0
6 is 3 times 12	It s 3 times 12	4.0
It s 3 times 12	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Both Andrew and James write down 31236  And now 6 inaudible is just 2	4.0
Both Andrew and James write down 31236  And now 6 inaudible is just 2	So 6 meters equals to  inaudible 13 equals and 1 2 equals no 2 equals and  half equals 2 inaudible	4.0
So 6 meters equals to  inaudible 13 equals and 1 2 equals no 2 equals and  half equals 2 inaudible	We got 24	1.0
Okay the next one	We got 6	3.0
Walks over to Beth What did you  guys get for the next one	We are trying to we are thinking	0.0
We are trying to we are thinking	We got 24 and 6	3.0
Brian is drawing models to show his reasoning	Jessica 12 meter got inaudible for one half meter bows	3.0
Jessica 12 meter got inaudible for one half meter bows	We  got	0.0
We  got	What did we get	2.0
What did we get	Laura answers Oh yeah 24  for half meter bows right	3.0
Laura answers Oh yeah 24  for half meter bows right	So we have 24 for half  meter ones	3.0
So we have 24 for half  meter ones	So we got 2 meter bows for  how many  meters do we have	2.0
James is writing down his explanation	See the meters bows are going to be half meters	3.0
See the meters bows are going to be half meters	So  they can t be 2	3.0
So  they can t be 2	Say this was inaudible	0.0
Say this was inaudible	It s not I know that	0.0
It s not I know that	You  divide it in to half	3.0
You  divide it in to half	You have two pieces	3.0
You have two pieces	Do you know  what I mean	0.0
Do you know  what I mean	You are not going to have 24	3.0
You are not going to have 24	But you have TWELVE meters	1.0
But you have TWELVE meters	So you have to divide  each meter in half	3.0
How many bows can we make if each one is  half a meter	For each one	0.0
Right	Oh I thought you meant one	3.0
Do you change  your mind	Yeah because I thought you meant divide the whole  thing  into two	3.0
So do you agree	Yes	0.0
Is that clear now	Yes	0.0
Okay now tell me how many 23 meter bows you can  make from 12 meters of ribbon	The fourth one would be 12	3.0
The fourth one would be 12	Wait we didn t get the third one	1.0
Wait we didn t get the third one	Third is you have to get 13 meters inaudible	1.0
Third is you have to get 13 meters inaudible	Twelve times six right	3.0
Twelve times six right	I got it	0.0
I got it	You have to try	0.0
You have to try	12  times 6 inaudlbe	3.0
12  times 6 inaudlbe	This is the rule inaudible half	4.0
This is the rule inaudible half	So there will be two	4.0
So there will be two	No	1.0
Maybe Meredith is having difficulty because now  she has to divide by a number that is not a whole  number	Yes	1.0
Yes	So  you can only cut it in half so inaudible	3.0
So  you can only cut it in half so inaudible	36	1.0
36	No wait	0.0
No wait	I could do these	0.0
I could do these	8 times 2 is 16	4.0
8 times 2 is 16	76 and  twelve   So 7612 is 88	4.0
76 and  twelve   So 7612 is 88	What are you doing	2.0
What are you doing	We are making 12 meters	3.0
How did you do that	I put each meter together	4.0
I put each meter together	Well twelve is an even  number	4.0
Well twelve is an even  number	You can make two s out of it	4.0
You can make two s out of it	If I put two s  together I count two four six eight ten and twelve	4.0
If I put two s  together I count two four six eight ten and twelve	If  you put them together you only get six	4.0
To Danielle Do you know inaudible the same thing	I made these	0.0
So what about 13  meters	I did that right	3.0
I did that right	Oh	0.0
Oh	So each meter	0.0
So each meter	No I didnt say	0.0
No I didnt say	I said you count	3.0
I said you count	Six twelve  counting two times	3.0
Six twelve  counting two times	One second	0.0
One second	You said you inaudible each inaudible  six	1.0
You said you inaudible each inaudible  six	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	Wait say that again	2.0
Wait say that again	That s what you said about the half	1.0
That s what you said about the half	No	1.0
No	I said inaudible	0.0
I said inaudible	counting 36	3.0
counting 36	This will be 6 and we will make another one down  here	3.0
This will be 6 and we will make another one down  here	That is one third	4.0
That is one third	So there are two in each meter	4.0
So there are two in each meter	No   So 33  is 13	4.0
No   So 33  is 13	So I m going to put a pen  there	4.0
So I m going to put a pen  there	And 66  is 23	4.0
And 66  is 23	And then 96	4.0
I want you to imagine what you know already  and try to draw a piT2ure and sketch it	No we can t	0.0
No we can t	All we know is that this is one third	3.0
If you want to use that thick of a inaudible here	Guys we need three 13 s	3.0
Guys we need three 13 s	We only took two 13 s	3.0
We only took two 13 s	We  need three	3.0
We  need three	Guys what we need is we need three thirds because  we don t need two halves	4.0
This shows me that Meredith knows that there are  3 13 s in a meter instead of 2 13 s in a meter	No we need two thirds	1.0
No we need two thirds	inaudible two thirds but we have to divide it to three  thirds	1.0
inaudible two thirds but we have to divide it to three  thirds	That and that	0.0
That and that	And we only have that much left	3.0
And we only have that much left	So try it now	0.0
So try it now	I don t think so	3.0
I don t think so	It can t be there	3.0
It can t be there	It has to be farther up	3.0
It has to be farther up	I know where	0.0
I know where	I can  estimate	0.0
I can  estimate	If we put it here no	0.0
Do you want to explain this again in front of the camera	What I did was  I made 12 meters	4.0
What I did was  I made 12 meters	The long line is the  divider for each meter	4.0
The long line is the  divider for each meter	In the meters there are three  thirds	4.0
In the meters there are three  thirds	The bracket shows these two thirds and there  are two thirds and so on	4.0
The bracket shows these two thirds and there  are two thirds and so on	So when you go down the  final answer is 18	4.0
So when you go down the  final answer is 18	And that s the number of bows you  can make with 23 meter bows	4.0
Ok Kimberly and Alan tell us what you did	This entire thing is twelve  meters	3.0
This entire thing is twelve  meters	The long line is the divider of each meter   The brackets are dividing the thirds up so  there are two thirds there are two thirds there are two  thirds there are two thirds and if you count up how  many two thirds there are youll eventually get down  to eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  of two thirds out of twelve meters	4.0
Questions	Well me and James did uh the same  thing that did the twelve and we got eighteen too	1.0
Any other questions  comments	How are we going to be able to write what  they did	0.0
How are we going to be able to write what  they did	I mean if we write that cause were going to  have to diagram it theres no way were going to be  able to write it	0.0
I mean if we write that cause were going to  have to diagram it theres no way were going to be  able to write it	Should I explain it again	0.0
Should I explain it again	No I know what you mean but wed have to  diagram it to write it we couldnt write it in words wed  have to diagram it	0.0
Ok so one more time  please	Ok this this is all twelve meters the line this  line is what divides each meter up in each meter  there are three thirds	4.0
Ok this this is all twelve meters the line this  line is what divides each meter up in each meter  there are three thirds	The bracket has two thirds  under it which means those are the two thirds to  make your bow and if here are two thirds here are two  thirds here are two thirds here are two thirds and  you keep going on to the end until you get up to  eighteen and thats how many bows you can make  out of two thirds each meter um of twelve meters of  ribbon	4.0
Question	I agree with that because in my book we had  the  book for two thirds uh I did the same  thing like that and thats how I got my answer	4.0
Ok go very slowly Kimberly	This one here all together is twelve  meters	4.0
This one here all together is twelve  meters	And these here the long lines separate  between em	4.0
And these here the long lines separate  between em	And there are three meters in each  meter and the brackets separate two meters and two  thirds in each meter	4.0
I dont think you meant to say that	I know I didnt	0.0
What did you mean then	I meant three thirds	3.0
Three thirds of a meter in each meter	And then the brackets separate two  thirds in each meter	3.0
What do you think Laura	Twelve	3.0
What do you think	um Eleven	3.0
Andrew thinks eleven	Wait no ten	3.0
Brian	Thirteen	3.0
James	I think eleven	3.0
David	Well I think I think ten	3.0
You think ten Erik	I think eleven	3.0
Would you have to cut  the last one or is it cut for you already	No	0.0
Is the last cut is the last piece of ribbon or is it  cut for you already	There is one more	3.0
There is one more	Alan made a mistake	1.0
Ok but if youre cutting this ribbon how many  cuts do you make	Eleven	3.0
You make eleven cuts and how many pieces  do you get when you cut it	Twelve	3.0
After they  marked off these one meter lengths what did they do  next	They put the two thirds in	3.0
Well before they put the two thirds in what  did they do before they put the two thirds in Meredith	Brackets	3.0
Before they marked two thirds what did they mark  first Andrew	Well the um the thirds	3.0
Meredith	Well so they could know where to put  the brackets	1.0
Did the  brackets show one third	No	0.0
Graham	Two thirds	1.0
Andrew	They numbered them	1.0
Why did you start numbering them Kimberly	So that we can find out the answer  because we lost count a few times before we put the  numbers	4.0
Oh yeah you lost count I remember one time  you said seventeen and sixteen and	Yeah	0.0
And what  did how many numbers did they end up having when  they counted two of the thirds	Eighteen	3.0
How many of you think that  you can write up or try to write what they did	I think I can diagram it I dont think I can write  about it	0.0
I think I can diagram it I dont think I can write  about it	We did basically what they did	1.0
If there are one third meter lengths how  many	Seven	3.0
Twelve meters of ribbon one third meter each	Oh	0.0
Oh	Twentyfour	3.0
No one third	Oh thirtysix	3.0
Andrew	Um I said I um multiplied either um  one third two third six or two to twelve and I got the  answer	3.0
Thank you	Since 2 yellows off the top theres 2 yellows on the bottom	4.0
I just want them to notice	Theres 4 and 4	3.0
What you notice	Theres 4 yellows and then 4 greens	4.0
Theres 4 yellows and then 4 greens	4 plus 4 equals eight	4.0
If you think theyre different I want you to think of a reason why theyre different because these are separate pictures	Theres a square on the top and theres a line that goes down on the bottom and theres a line that goes through the right on the bottom	4.0
Would that make them the same or different	Different	3.0
Different	Do a yellow on the bottom	3.0
Do a yellow on the bottom	Then 2 green ones at the top	3.0
So would that make them different or the same	Different	3.0
Different	Both of them have 6 white spaces	3.0
Tamaz is going to say it one more time so that I can then point at it so we can all see it	Both of them have 6 white spaces	3.0
Were going to count	123456	0.0
Lets do the one on top	123456	0.0
Kamora	There was 2 yellows on the bottom and 2 greens on the top and 2 on the top and 2 greens on the bottom	3.0
And be sure to speak loudly so that we can hear you  and the camera will be on you while youre doing that	David had eight I mean fourteen little logs	0.0
David had eight I mean fourteen little logs	Paul had five  little logs	0.0
Paul had five  little logs	how many more little logs does David have than  Paul	0.0
What did you find was your answer	Nine	3.0
Do you remember	Oh I know	0.0
ok	Five and four is nine	4.0
What did you do Stephanie	Well I used these and yeah	4.0
Well I used these and yeah	I put fourteen on one and five on the other and i think we  counted out	4.0
I put fourteen on one and five on the other and i think we  counted out	The first answer we had was four	4.0
Can you make a tower for me	Fourteen  and heres his five	3.0
Can you count	One two three four five six seven eight  nine	0.0
Fourteen take away five equals nine is that how you solved  it Aaron	He wrote it on a piece of paper	1.0
Alright you  want to go on to the next one	Sure	0.0
Sure	There are eleven men in the room there are six women  in the room	0.0
There are eleven men in the room there are six women  in the room	How many fewer women are there are  in the  room	0.0
Okay and what did you find as your answer	Five	3.0
Five Could you show me that with your unifix cubes	Okay	0.0
Okay and how is it that you did those again	We um	0.0
you had the eleven for the men	Six were wrong its six	3.0
Six were wrong its six	Gerardo Its six look	3.0
How many how many women were in the room	Six of them	3.0
How  many show us the tower	This is the tower of the men this is the tower of the	3.0
This is the tower of the men this is the tower of the	This is  the tower of the men and this is the tower of the women	3.0
This is  the tower of the men and this is the tower of the women	This starts out at six	3.0
Can you count that	One two three four five	0.0
you were  right	Jim has three tennis ball Jim has one fewer tennis ball than  Don	0.0
Jim has three tennis ball Jim has one fewer tennis ball than  Don	How many tennis balls does Don have	0.0
And what did you get as your answer	Four	3.0
Four so if Don has four does he have one fewer than Jim  cuz Jim has three	No	0.0
Does he have one fewer	No	0.0
Does he	Yes	0.0
what do you  think  sweetie	I think its four	3.0
Does he have one  fewer side by side	Yeah	0.0
Ok good want to do the next one Stephanie	Zack has three chickens if grandpa sells three chickens he  will have as many as Zack	0.0
Zack has three chickens if grandpa sells three chickens he  will have as many as Zack	How many chickens does  Grandpa have	0.0
How many chickens does  Grandpa have	Now our first answer was six but then again  we thought it was three	3.0
Why did you first have six	Thats interesting	0.0
Thats interesting	Well because if you grandpa had um well his dad had three   and if grandpa sells three we figure he will have the same  amount as dad so you know hed have six altogether	4.0
That sounds very nice very good to me Stephanie	Well weve got our three its just that grandpa will have the  same as many grandpa will have the same amount of  chickens as dad and that totals out to three	4.0
Stephanie can you explain to me the two words that you  said was so important at first it was as instead of and	What	2.0
And I really wanted to know what you meant	Okay well what I meant was then I looked at the last one  and I saw that there was no ed	4.0
Okay well what I meant was then I looked at the last one  and I saw that there was no ed	If it was had then I would  figure out it was six but if it was has have and so thats  what I thought it was three	4.0
If it was had then I would  figure out it was six but if it was has have and so thats  what I thought it was three	Thats how it was three	4.0
What do you think the answer is Stephanie	I think its six	3.0
You think its six if he starts with  six and he sells three then he will have as many as dad	Three	3.0
Do you agree with Aaron hes  saying he thinks its six	It might be three	1.0
What do you think if grandpa has three and he then sells  three does he have as many as dad	No	0.0
What would he have if he had three and then he sells three	none	3.0
None or zero so would he have as many as dad	No	0.0
And then would he have the same number as dad	Yes	0.0
If grandpa has six and he sells three  then	I know what hes saying he would have three more like dad	1.0

Michelle Well wouldn t this be like even though it is the length  equals the volume you have to state that it s length times  width times height so you put length times one times one  even though it is just length to show	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I guess	0.0
I guess	But it s because the length is  we all ready have the cubes and we just need the surface	4.0

I left it and dropped it because it was too heavy	Okay the length of the square units	3.0
What s what s what s what s  causing you trouble	No because length equals volume but see it s that s too	4.0
You know that s definitely false	It s not	3.0
It s not	Okay if you use this	4.0
Okay if you use this	This is what we re using as a  measuring tool	4.0
This is what we re using as a  measuring tool	And one two of these equals that one	4.0
And one two of these equals that one	So  then this one is two units cubed	4.0
So  then this one is two units cubed	Which also equals length	1.0
Which also equals length	But wouldn t length equals  y	3.0
You know length can t equal volume	Yeah we know that	0.0
I think what  you re trying to tell me is that you used two of these right	Yeah	0.0
Do you understand Michelle	Length equals volume	3.0

Michelle See you have to state what the width and the height is to  calculate volume even if it is just one	Length times one times one	3.0
Is that true here length times 1 times 1	Well because well not here	4.0
Well because well not here	Length times we could do  length times width times height	4.0
Right but you re giving me a formula for one rod right	Yeah	0.0
Your rule should fit volume more generally	How about length in units times width in units times height  in units equals volume	3.0
Does that work	Don t we know that all ready	0.0
In another case	Yea because this then the length of this would be 3	4.0
Yea because this then the length of this would be 3	The  width of this would be 2 and the height of would be 3	4.0
The  width of this would be 2 and the height of would be 3	Of course it would	1.0
But the volume does not equal length	No	0.0
No	We knew that	0.0
You were  saying L equals V	Why did you say that	0.0
Why did you say that	Now you re making us look stupid	0.0
So when you make up a rule make sure you say something  that s true	Go for it Michelle	0.0
Go for it Michelle	Length times width times height	3.0
Length times width times height	Length in units times width in units times height in units	1.0

2635 R1 Okay	So what did you do here	2.0
So what did you do here	We have show her in units times height units times width  and units times length equals volume	3.0
We have show her in units times height units times width  and units times length equals volume	A simple answer	0.0
Again one more time	It s just length times height times width equals volume	4.0
It s just length times height times width equals volume	So  for example this would just this one would be 2 x 1 x 1	4.0
So  for example this would just this one would be 2 x 1 x 1	That s length times height times width	4.0
That s length times height times width	If you had something  like this it d be 2 x 2 x 2	4.0

Where do you see words	At the bottom	3.0
Iyanna	I noticed they used base 10 blocks	3.0
Is that pictures numbers or is that words	pictures	3.0
Chaniya	I see words I see numbers	3.0
Where do you see numbers	Show how you know your answer is correct	0.0
Youre looking at what do you think this is	The answer	3.0
Nia	They have a number sentence	3.0
Lets go a little bit deeper okay	Ms Lewis	0.0
Ms Lewis	I just noticed something	0.0
KaLon	I noticed that they was making the number model but they forgot the plus	3.0
You noticed that they were making a number model but they forgot the	Plus	3.0
Plus	It says 10 Its supposed to be 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 3 plus 10	4.0
It says 10 Its supposed to be 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 3 plus 10	I mean 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 3 plus 10 plus 9 equals 82	4.0
How many did you find	Sixteen	3.0
You think that might be	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
And maybe even nineteen	Yeah	0.0
Okay how did you decide there were just sixteen	Well if you got seventeen you must have  some of the patterns that you already have	4.0
Did anybody else think that if you had seventeen  there must be another one	Yes	0.0
Yes	There must have been one	3.0
And	Because there could be like switched around	4.0
And why do you think they have been switched by the other  way around	It just was  there	0.0
And did you  do that Stephanie	Yeah well we have something here that we have like a  pattern red blue red blue and then we have a pattern thats  like blue red blue red	3.0
Can  you show me one that would be switched to be the opposites  of each other	We put blue red blue red and red blue red blue	3.0
We put blue red blue red and red blue red blue	And all blue  and all red	3.0
Okay these two here are these the ones you are talking  about	No these two	0.0
No these two	This one and this one are complete opposites	3.0
How are they totally opposite	Because this color and this color is different from this color  and this color and this color and this color and this color	4.0
Okay were there any other patterns that you used that are opposites	2 Red and blue	3.0
Or did you think  there might be seventeen	First we thought there might be seventeen because we made  one more that was seventeenth but when we were checking  it was the same as another that we had	4.0
First we thought there might be seventeen because we made  one more that was seventeenth but when we were checking  it was the same as another that we had	So we gave up at  sixteen	0.0
Could have there been nineteen	Its possible	3.0
Its possible	Maybe	0.0
Oh could you find one	No	0.0
Okay so you really think that sixteen is right	Yeah	0.0
Does anybody else what an even number is and  what an odd number is	Even number is when you have two numbers that are the  same and that if you have two friends and you  have four piece of candy you can each have two	4.0
Even number is when you have two numbers that are the  same and that if you have two friends and you  have four piece of candy you can each have two	And odd is  if you have two friends and three candies it wouldnt be  fair	4.0
How  did you	Well you just think of patterns and like opposites so like	3.0
So does it always happen in opposites	Well if you didnt have opposites we only have eight	4.0
If you didnt  have opposites you would have only had eight	Yeah	0.0
What do you think	There would be more towers	3.0
How many do you think there would be	Nineteen	3.0
What do you think Brian	Because there are fewer numbers of blocks	4.0
So you think there would be more than sixteen or fewer than  sixteen	More	3.0
What do you think	I think it would be less towers	3.0
Why	Well because if you have sixteen now you wont get and you would need more because	4.0
Or do you think there would be  more	Uhm  Exactly the same	3.0
What do you think	I think higher	3.0
Why	Because if you get and you start making with  that one and that one you keep on and you could  make more than sixteen	4.0
But because there are more blocks you think  there might be more towers	I think there might be less	3.0
Why	Because three is less than four	4.0
Because three is less than four	You would have the same  kind of patterns so there might be less than sixteen	4.0
You think there would be fewer patterns if you had only  three	But at the same kind of patterns but fewer numbers	3.0
Why do you think the same kind of patterns	Because same kind of patterns we have there at four but	4.0
What do you mean by the same kind of patterns	Because well there are four here	4.0
Because well there are four here	Because these are all red  and if you take one away and its the same pattern and it  only has three blocks	4.0
Stephanie and Dana what would be one  that is different from what Jamie has	Well this one	3.0
What does it look like	Well lets see	0.0
Well lets see	Its got red blue and red	3.0
Can you come up with one that is different from these	Like that	0.0
What about you	Blue blue and red	3.0
You think itll be twenty one	I found more combinations	0.0
So you have to make a really  good guess because you are doing it for two people	I think the same	3.0
I think the same	Same as sixteen	3.0
Same as sixteen	You have four and you  take the top off and you have three	4.0
You have four and you  take the top off and you have three	If you try to make some  three you would get the same	4.0
Okay Brian and Jeff	We think its the same	3.0
Okay what do you think	Well we think its the same	3.0
Do you remember what we talked about	If they would tell them how much people can fit in like three  of these	3.0
But there were just three what  was	It was like how many people can fit inside	3.0
It was like how many people can fit inside	I know	0.0
I know	The question was if you have  if there  would be more same or less	3.0
Okay the question was if there is a tower instead of four  blocks there are three blocks in it  how many  towers are there	There would be sixteen	3.0
Dana and Stephanie	We think its the same	3.0
Why	Well because you are just taking one away from here its  not like its going to change the whole thing	4.0
Well because you are just taking one away from here its  not like its going to change the whole thing	Its gonna be  one less	4.0
Okay what about the	Five	3.0
What do you think	Same	3.0
So what about you	We think its more	3.0
We think its more	We think its the same	1.0
We think its the same	I know but I think its two hundred	3.0
Oh so its a lot more	I think its the same	3.0
What do you think	Less	3.0
How many do you think youll have	7 Fourteen	3.0

How do we  figure that out	each pattern	3.0
And then	And then count up how many you have	3.0
Okay can everybody put their cards next to here and see if	Dont forget the top	0.0
Dont forget the top	The top	0.0
The top	No	0.0
Just like before	Wait we have them	0.0

This wont match	No blue on top	1.0
No blue on top	They are all blue and we wont have any  blue	3.0
They are all blue and we wont have any  blue	Then red on top	3.0
Then red on top	No Brian then we will have another one	1.0
No Brian then we will have another one	Put that on the bottom	3.0
How is it going	Very good	0.0
Very good	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	We got  blues are on the bottom and reds are on top	3.0
We got  blues are on the bottom and reds are on top	Well we are putting them back together	0.0
Well we are putting them back together	You gotta take one  off the top	3.0
You gotta take one  off the top	Oh good we have	0.0
Make sure every one is different	And here is a blue one in the middle	3.0
And here is a blue one in the middle	Blue one in the idle blue one in the middle blue in the  middle	1.0
Blue one in the idle blue one in the middle blue in the  middle	We have fifteen	3.0
We have fifteen	Thats definitely the last	3.0
Thats definitely the last	Your bottoms you can change it al  around	3.0
Your bottoms you can change it al  around	Take one in the middle like this	3.0
Take one in the middle like this	Look at this	0.0
Look at this	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	Triple  match	3.0
Triple  match	Blues on the top blues on the top  I dont think I have a  match	3.0
Blues on the top blues on the top  I dont think I have a  match	No this	1.0
No this	Yes	0.0
Yes	Liar	0.0
Liar	Oh yeah this piece	0.0
Oh yeah this piece	Like this  A  double match a triple match a quadruple match	3.0
Like this  A  double match a triple match a quadruple match	I am not convinced yet	1.0
What do you think	So far we got	0.0
Well you cant do that	We got double match	3.0
We got double match	We got a quadruple match	3.0
We got a quadruple match	We are going to have nothing left	3.0
We are going to have nothing left	One two three four  five six seven eight nine	0.0
One two three four  five six seven eight nine	This one	0.0
This one	No match	3.0
No match	And we are convinced	0.0
And we are convinced	Brian there is less	3.0
Oh yeah	There is less because we can only have one two three four  five six	4.0
There is less because we can only have one two three four  five six	One two tree four seven	4.0
One two tree four seven	I have seven	4.0
Lets line them up	We are just going to  that there is only seven	3.0
Oops there is a same one right here	Where	2.0
Where	Ughh	0.0
Ughh	Two four six	3.0
Does that one have an opposite	Yes	0.0
Yes	Awesome	0.0
I thought you said opposite was  blue red blue red blue blue	We never said anything about the opposites	0.0
But thats what you did it here	Hey alright	0.0
Hey alright	Lets do it	0.0
Lets do it	So	0.0
What is the  opposite of that	You have to say red blue blue	3.0
What is the opposite of  this	I have no idea	0.0
If this is the opposite of this what is  the opposite of this	Oh then its two blues and red	3.0
Oh then its two blues and red	Yes we got it	1.0
This is what they were talking about up  there	Oh I know	0.0
Dont mess with the others	Thats the opposites	0.0
What is the opposite of this	Oh my god its	0.0
Okay can everybody look up	Six seven eight we got eight	3.0
Okay now before I say anything does anybody want to  change their minds	Yes	0.0
What did you get now	Its less there is only eight	3.0
How come	Well because once you take these apart you start to see that	4.0
Well because once you take these apart you start to see that	The match	1.0
The match	Because one took it off and made a whole difference	4.0
How many of them were a match	Eight	3.0
Michelle	Its	0.0
Michelle	Because there is	0.0
Okay what about	1 We think its less	3.0
Okay what about	2 We said it was less and eight	3.0
Why do you  think so	Because you take one off the bottom and one off the top  you might have another that is same as that	4.0
Because you take one off the bottom and one off the top  you might have another that is same as that	And then you  have to make like things that you cant use them because its  a match and they have to be different	4.0
And Brian how did you figure that	Well because first of all you could choose to do it the math  problem	4.0
Well because first of all you could choose to do it the math  problem	Sixteen minus eight is eight	4.0
You mean there is something about math to it	Yeah because sixteen minus eight or eight plus eight equals  sixteen	4.0
Yeah because sixteen minus eight or eight plus eight equals  sixteen	And when you take one away from each it would  be one minus one minus one minus because its sixteen  minus eight or eight plus eight	4.0
calls on a student	We changed our minds to less	3.0
And Jamie said there would be the same	I dont know why I did that	0.0
Can everybody agree  now there is less	Yes	0.0
What do you think	Oh I think they are the same	3.0
Are you Jeff	No hes Jeff	0.0
Oh	Ok so this if this is in fact the middle one what does that	3.0
Ok so this if this is in fact the middle one what does that	I don t know I m  curious to know why you did this why you how you saw this as being helpful to  the pizza problem	2.0
I don t know I m  curious to know why you did this why you how you saw this as being helpful to  the pizza problem	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Was this helpful to you when you were doing it or no	1.0
Was this helpful to you when you were doing it or no	Um well not this part but the towers were	3.0
Um well not this part but the towers were	But thats like because I remembered  how we figured out the total combinations	3.0
But thats like because I remembered  how we figured out the total combinations	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	That the same thing to figure this out	3.0
That the same thing to figure this out	So I guess its helpful in that sense but this  wasn t it just	0.0
So I guess its helpful in that sense but this  wasn t it just	Is there a yeah I was interested when you grabbed that	1.0
Is there a yeah I was interested when you grabbed that	It was useless	3.0
It was useless	We were just hoping there was an easier way	1.0
We were just hoping there was an easier way	well you never know	0.0
well you never know	We were hoping there was a really easy way	3.0
We were hoping there was a really easy way	Well I think that the way you did it I mean you started to see some things that  made it easier right	1.0
Well I think that the way you did it I mean you started to see some things that  made it easier right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I heard you say something about well there s an easier way and look we could get this right away and then you started fiddling with these numbers here	1.0
I heard you say something about well there s an easier way and look we could get this right away and then you started fiddling with these numbers here	So maybe you did find an easier way	1.0
So maybe you did find an easier way	I m not quite sure I think this is very interesting and I think it is interesting that these numbers that you see them reflected over there and I m just wondering if there is anything any other relationship between these two	1.0
I m not quite sure I think this is very interesting and I think it is interesting that these numbers that you see them reflected over there and I m just wondering if there is anything any other relationship between these two	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	You said something before uh also that interested me uh you said there is supposed to be a two over there or something when you were talking about what you did in Mr Pentozzi s class	1.0
You said something before uh also that interested me uh you said there is supposed to be a two over there or something when you were talking about what you did in Mr Pentozzi s class	Oh no I think she left like one thing out because like I have it 1 and then I have two 1s because this is like zero toppings	4.0
Oh no I think she left like one thing out because like I have it 1 and then I have two 1s because this is like zero toppings	Yeah I was thinking that	1.0
Yeah I was thinking that	And then with one topping	3.0
And then with one topping	Yeah it s supposed to be like one one	1.0
Yeah it s supposed to be like one one	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	And then actually that s why our top wasn t working out	0.0
And then actually that s why our top wasn t working out	Okay so	0.0
Okay so	Because we were having trouble yeah Bobby thanks for uh telling us before	0.0
Because we were having trouble yeah Bobby thanks for uh telling us before	As we re all here lost  Got anything Bobby	0.0
As we re all here lost  Got anything Bobby	noooo I m just not doing anything	0.0
noooo I m just not doing anything	Bobby s just drawing and we re like  why isn t it working	0.0
Bobby s just drawing and we re like  why isn t it working	Well he s drawing all kinds of stuff over here so he was really busy	0.0
Well he s drawing all kinds of stuff over here so he was really busy	So what wasn t working out before when you were missing that other one	0.0
So what wasn t working out before when you were missing that other one	Oh it was just uhh	0.0
Oh it was just uhh	Lets say this was plain	3.0
Lets say this was plain	We would jump from like plain to like two toppings and we had no idea we were like	1.0
We would jump from like plain to like two toppings and we had no idea we were like	Yeah and that didnt even work for plain so we were like why isn t working for plain	1.0
Yeah and that didnt even work for plain so we were like why isn t working for plain	Yeah so were like that s not working	1.0
Yeah so were like that s not working	Of course Bobby had the answer all along and didn t care to share with us	0.0
Of course Bobby had the answer all along and didn t care to share with us	Got anything over there Bobby	0.0
Got anything over there Bobby	No I don t have anything	0.0
No I don t have anything	But hey we wont hold that against him	0.0
But hey we wont hold that against him	Well he wanted to give you an opportunity to think about this	1.0
Well he wanted to give you an opportunity to think about this	to look really stupid	0.0
Now my next question is How many pizzas how many towers are these problems	The same	3.0
The same or	Mhmm yeah	0.0
How can you convince me that these are the same problem	Its easier to explain the two thing with this because there are only two colors	3.0
You like that huh	Yeah	0.0
I think that s easier to see that with the two colors I think most people	Its all the toppings it throws you off you expect like 800 pizzas	3.0
Its all the toppings it throws you off you expect like 800 pizzas	Yeah mhmm	1.0
So that the toppings don t	Yeah	0.0
Robert	Toppings is the height	3.0
Toppings is the height	Like 4 toppings would be a tower 4 high and then the two colors would be with or without toppings	4.0
Like 4 toppings would be a tower 4 high and then the two colors would be with or without toppings	I guess that would work	0.0
I guess that would work	Mhm	1.0
That s what you just told me right	Yeah	0.0
In the pizza if you were thinking of	Peppers or oh no no it would be	3.0
Peppers or oh no no it would be	It would either mean you had a topping there or you didn t have a topping there	1.0
It would either mean you had a topping there or you didn t have a topping there	Yeah	1.0
Oh So  b  means you either put whatever topping is	Right	1.0
Right	Is that what you are trying to say	1.0
Is that what you are trying to say	Yeah but like it wouldn t work because you d have more than one a topping	4.0
Yeah but like it wouldn t work because you d have more than one a topping	I think he s on the right track but	1.0
Lets follow that thinking right	So	0.0
Fair enough	Mhmm	0.0
Ok so you have four toppings so let s go through our toppings right	Mhm	0.0
We have what are they	Well for which	2.0
Well for which	Peppers	3.0
For four high	We have	0.0
So this would mean you either choose peppers or you don t	Mhmm	0.0
Mhmm	You choose peppers or you don t	0.0
You choose peppers or you don t	No you choose mushrooms or you don t you choose sausage or you don t  and you choose um pepperoni or you don t because your going to have four of them	4.0
No you choose mushrooms or you don t you choose sausage or you don t  and you choose um pepperoni or you don t because your going to have four of them	And each one is gonna have like if it was written like that like here would be mushrooms like going all the way across and each tower you had with an  r  there meant that you didn t have mushrooms	4.0
Ok	You know what I mean	0.0
You know what I mean	So youre gonna have all the towers four high like that	4.0
So youre gonna have all the towers four high like that	And for each one with an r there you have mushrooms on it Or you dont have know and just like thatmushrooms on it	4.0
And for each one with an r there you have mushrooms on it Or you dont have know and just like thatmushrooms on it	You know	0.0
You know	And then heres the peppers and if theyre you	3.0
Ok I wonder I know that you have to leave	Mhm	0.0
All of you were Able to follow it	Amy tell me what she was saying	0.0
I m thinking of the same rows can you tell what I am supposed to imagine  in my head with towers	Isn t like so many high and then so	3.0
Ok so tell me so this  would be how high	That would be three high right	3.0
That would be three high right	Yeah	0.0
Three high	Three high and then its how many colors you have	3.0
remember we did it on the bottom	Yeah	0.0
If you had blue and red	If you have blue and red if you had two colors	0.0
So what does the one represent	One of all like say blue like three high of all blue cubes	3.0
Mhmm ok I could imagine that and what does the three represent	You could have like um three towers where you have like 2 blue and one red  umm	3.0
So now you have	two red and one blue	3.0
If your making this all blue and your making this	Oh that would probably be	0.0
Oh that would probably be	I think that would be one the way that it would work  out it would be one blue and two reds and the next would  be two blue and one red	4.0
How many blues are here	All	3.0
All	Three	1.0
So this your going from three blue to one blue	Oh I dont know	2.0
Oh I dont know	Three blues to two blues	3.0
Three blues to two blues	Too one blue to none	1.0
Too one blue to none	Or you could do it the other way around with three reds	1.0
So tell me where the 4	Okay	0.0
Because she hasn t played with it for a  long time right	Yeah I guess you could say that	0.0
You too Shelly you haven t played with this in a while so you can help me	That would be four like four blue three blue two blue one blue no blue Or	4.0
How does the one plus three  give you the four	Because youre just adding the extra block on	4.0
Can you see them	Mhmm	0.0
What do you  see in your heads	Blocks	3.0
How do you see the three of them with exactly one red	Umm one with a red at the top	3.0
Umm one with a red at the top	One with the red in the middle and one with a red at the bottom	3.0
You all could imagine that	Mhmm	0.0
So how do we now get these four with one red	Umm wait I have to think	0.0
Alright	These are all blue Right	3.0
These are all blue Right	And these are one blue	3.0
And these are one blue	Is that what were saying	0.0
These are	No red	1.0
No red	So these are all blue and these are one blue	1.0
So these are all blue and these are one blue	Yeah hehe same thing	1.0
Youre much more expert  on these towers than I am without having them in front of me	Oh these are all blue these are two blue	3.0
Oh these are all blue these are two blue	I m sorry	0.0
I m sorry	That was	0.0
Right or no red and one red	Ok that was	0.0
Ok that was	Yes	0.0
Yes	So here all you re doing is adding one red	3.0
So this has to be a one red	Yes so you already have um three with one red so here this becomes the fourth  one with one red because here there is no reds	4.0
Yes so you already have um three with one red so here this becomes the fourth  one with one red because here there is no reds	And each of them get a block like  added to them how do I ok	4.0
I can see my little stack here and this little stack here there is only one of them  and its all blue no red right	Yeah where is your picture	0.0
Yeah where is your picture	Do you have your picture to that	0.0
Do you have your picture to that	No	0.0
Why don t you make a picture	Ok	0.0
Ok	So here is you have the one  three high with all blue	4.0
So here is you have the one  three high with all blue	Then you have the three with one red so you have red  blue blue blue red blue blue blue red	4.0
Then you have the three with one red so you have red  blue blue blue red blue blue blue red	And then these two make	4.0
And then these two make	This one is  four blues	4.0
This one is  four blues	Well that was	4.0
Well that was	ok and these two together make um  the one with four the four with one red	4.0
ok and these two together make um  the one with four the four with one red	So this one gets a red added on because  its already got three blues so it cant have any more blues	4.0
So this one gets a red added on because  its already got three blues so it cant have any more blues	And then these three  all get a blue added on to it	4.0
Because they already have one red	They already have one red	0.0
Does that make sense	Mhmm	0.0
Help me see it	You dont see it	0.0
Can you show it to me	All right well here	0.0
All right well here	The one one two one  one three three one one four six four one	4.0
Okay let show me again wheres the four	All right	0.0
All right	Were on all right	0.0
Were on all right	The that one  right there	3.0
Mm hm	that we added in and this two is the three	4.0
that we added in and this two is the three	The  two in that one there is a three and theres two  ones on the outside	4.0
Mm hum	So you get one three three one	4.0
So you get one three three one	And then one the one and the three for the four	4.0
And then one the one and the three for the four	Three and  the three for the six	4.0
Three and  the three for the six	The three and the one for  the other four and then the other one on the end  and then continuing through the four and the  one together is the five	4.0
The three and the one for  the other four and then the other one on the end  and then continuing through the four and the  one together is the five	The four and the six is  the ten	4.0
The four and the six is  the ten	Six and the four is the other ten	4.0
Six and the four is the other ten	Four  and the one is the five	4.0
Four  and the one is the five	Do you see it	0.0
Why where this ten comes  from when you know youre just saying well  theres a pattern here because you found them  but is there a way where you havent found  them that makes sense to predict the number of  paths of one you havent found	Well like to here I mean we would say	0.0
You understand my question	Well like to here we would say it was thirty five	3.0
How would you how where would  the thirtyfive come from	You cant justify it because You can justify  these because you can say you counted	4.0
You cant justify it because You can justify  these because you can say you counted	You  cant justify that because you cant say you  counted	4.0
You  cant justify that because you cant say you  counted	Yeah because we didnt count it	4.0
Yeah because we didnt count it	Were saying  were following the pattern	1.0
Right	Thats that is our justification as of now	3.0
Right	That were just following the pattern	3.0
What Im asking	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	What if three what if Pascal	2.0
Because so you notice this pattern and the  pattern fits Pascals triangle	So does that mean theres thirtyfive for the  red one	3.0
So does that mean theres thirtyfive for the  red one	Only these are zeros	4.0
Only these are zeros	This is like one topping you know on the pizza	4.0
This is like one topping you know on the pizza	Yeah one topping two toppings	1.0
Yeah one topping two toppings	Remember how Mike you had thirtyfour for  the red one right	1.0
Remember how Mike you had thirtyfour for  the red one right	Um Yeah I think that was the problem	1.0
Um Yeah I think that was the problem	Its thirtyfive	1.0
Its thirtyfive	Yeah its thirtyfive	1.0
Yeah its thirtyfive	Oh I probably missed one	3.0
Oh I probably missed one	Good uh deduction	0.0
So you counted thirtyfour by brute force and  youre saying that by this pattern um you  would feel more comfortable with the pattern  in saying thirtyfive	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But	0.0
Right	Did you actually get thirtyfive	2.0
Did you actually get thirtyfive	I got thirtyfour	3.0
I got thirtyfour	He got thirtyfour but you know hes been off  by like one cause you know	1.0
He got thirtyfour but you know hes been off  by like one cause you know	Yeah it could it  could of been one	3.0
Yeah it could it  could of been one	Natural tendencies	0.0
Natural tendencies	Um	0.0
Um	Stop that	0.0
So why is why is that	All right	0.0
Thats thats really isnt that  interesting	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	It it hurts though	0.0
It it hurts though	It really does	0.0
It really does	Yeah Im having trouble seeing Pascals  triangle	2.0
Its hard to see the other way isnt it	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	All right	0.0
All right	So for this one the two  comes from when theres	3.0

Hows this go	Just tell me  where this comes from	2.0
Just tell me  where this comes from	What happened	2.0
What happened	Okay	0.0
Okay	This is with with just one block	0.0
This is with with just one block	This is nothing	3.0
This is nothing	This is nothing	1.0
This is nothing	This is one block	0.0

Not two  blocks but like	One block two blocks three blocks Oh no  this is zero block one block two block	0.0
One block two blocks three blocks Oh no  this is zero block one block two block	For one block you get two	3.0
For one block you get two	Right	0.0
Right	For two  blocks	0.0
For two  blocks	All right	0.0
All right	Three three three blocks	4.0
Three three three blocks	One So you cant  really say it because theres three for three and  then you get four here	4.0
One So you cant  really say it because theres three for three and  then you get four here	You cant really I  dont think you can use that	4.0
You cant really I  dont think you can use that	That that row  thing	4.0
That that row  thing	All right	0.0
All right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I know	0.0
I know	Im just trying to because for like	0.0
Im just trying to because for like	Theres got to be some type of you know  way	3.0
Theres got to be some type of you know  way	Be nice if I could see	0.0
Be nice if I could see	Cant you just go one two three four	3.0
Cant you just go one two three four	Uh hum	1.0
Uh hum	Thats what it goes one two three four	4.0
Thats what it goes one two three four	Because then okay for this one for the three	4.0
Because then okay for this one for the three	If  we name all the ones going horizontal As and  ones going down same with B	4.0
If  we name all the ones going horizontal As and  ones going down same with B	And this would  be with two As and one B theres three and  then theres two Bs with one A three	4.0
And this would  be with two As and one B theres three and  then theres two Bs with one A three	And for this one remember  like two As two Bs six	4.0
And for this one remember  like two As two Bs six	You could say um	0.0
You could say um	Do you understand what Im saying	0.0
Do you understand what Im saying	Like yeah these are like this row is everything  with perimeter two	3.0
Like yeah these are like this row is everything  with perimeter two	I mean I half the  perimeter like	3.0
I mean I half the  perimeter like	Well no Im saying so to get that	1.0
Well no Im saying so to get that	In order to get to that point you have to go  over one and down uh one or down one and  over one	4.0
In order to get to that point you have to go  over one and down uh one or down one and  over one	Just like that row	4.0
Just like that row	Everything in this  row over two and down two and over one	4.0
Everything in this  row over two and down two and over one	Yeah but like Im just saying like if she were  to pick anything like right there we could say  its like eight As and like six Bs	4.0
Yeah but like Im just saying like if she were  to pick anything like right there we could say  its like eight As and like six Bs	You know  like and then we could tell you where you it is  in  this one	4.0
You know  like and then we could tell you where you it is  in  this one	Well you could say all everything in this row  the shortest route is two	4.0
Well you could say all everything in this row  the shortest route is two	Everything in this  row shortest route is three	4.0
Everything in this  row shortest route is three	This one shortest  route is four	4.0
This one shortest  route is four	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	The shortest route is five six and so on	4.0
The shortest route is five six and so on	So  thats how you could you know name them	4.0
So  thats how you could you know name them	This is row six because it has everything in the  row has shortest route of six	4.0
This is row six because it has everything in the  row has shortest route of six	No I understand	1.0
No I understand	Im just saying like	0.0
Im just saying like	Theres a you know	0.0
Theres a you know	To get it	0.0
To get it	To to say it like oh Ill pick this block	0.0
To to say it like oh Ill pick this block	Because isnt that how isnt that how we get  like the Bs	4.0
Because isnt that how isnt that how we get  like the Bs	Like doesnt the two theres that  I mean thats one that means its one of A  color one of B color	4.0
Like doesnt the two theres that  I mean thats one that means its one of A  color one of B color	Heres one its  either one either way you go	4.0
Heres one its  either one either way you go	Its one of  across and one down	4.0
Its one of  across and one down	And for three that  means theres two A color and one B color   so  here its two across one down or the other way   you can get three is two down	4.0
And for three that  means theres two A color and one B color   so  here its two across one down or the other way   you can get three is two down	You mean like one A color and two	1.0
You mean like one A color and two	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	This is one	0.0
This is one	Like two blues one red	4.0
Like two blues one red	Two across one down  or this is two reds one  blue two down one  across	4.0
Two across one down  or this is two reds one  blue two down one  across	And thats how we would get the  Pascals triangle	4.0
And thats how we would get the  Pascals triangle	But theres like you know theres got to be a  way that we could just say all right this ones  three	4.0
But theres like you know theres got to be a  way that we could just say all right this ones  three	So five down this has to be this because  of some kind of	4.0
So five down this has to be this because  of some kind of	I know Im just saying	1.0
I know Im just saying	So if it were	0.0
So if it were	Pattern I mean like you know reasoning	1.0
Pattern I mean like you know reasoning	You  cant just say I counted them	3.0
You  cant just say I counted them	I know	1.0
I know	Im just saying so like and then that  could relate back to this but that is this so its  relateable and for	3.0
Im just saying so like and then that  could relate back to this but that is this so its  relateable and for	So what what are you looking for right now	2.0
So what what are you looking for right now	Yeah like	0.0
That if I  were to pick any point right on	Mm hmm	0.0
I  think he knows what Im looking for	Yeah	0.0
I  think Im hearing you say youre trying to  look at blocks	Mm hmm	0.0
Colors	Yeah	0.0
And then youre doing As and Bs	Mm hmm	0.0
I I thought I followed you but Im  not so sure that Brian and Michael followed  what you said	Like why	0.0
What you were	Like why this and this are related	3.0
Yeah	Well	0.0
Throw out your idea again for them so we  can hear it	When we look whenever we do this we  always we always talk about towers and how  this is like a tower of two high with two  different colors and theres one one tower you  can make that makes all one color and one and  one and then all the other color	4.0
When we look whenever we do this we  always we always talk about towers and how  this is like a tower of two high with two  different colors and theres one one tower you  can make that makes all one color and one and  one and then all the other color	And and then  for this one its three high and this is all one  color	4.0
And and then  for this one its three high and this is all one  color	Theres two of one color and one of the  other whatever	4.0
Theres two of one color and one of the  other whatever	And for this its basically the  same thing because this is lets see	4.0
And for this its basically the  same thing because this is lets see	This is this is two but usually you go one across and  one down so theres two different ways to get  to that one	4.0
This is this is two but usually you go one across and  one down so theres two different ways to get  to that one	And for this one theres going to be  two across and one down	4.0
And for this one theres going to be  two across and one down	Or to go down here  its two down and one across which is  basically the same thing and it just goes on	4.0
Or to go down here  its two down and one across which is  basically the same thing and it just goes on	Do  you understand	0.0

A pizza	A pizza with um three possible  choices for toppings and I like the tower	3.0
A pizza with um three possible  choices for toppings and I like the tower	Yeah the tower is easier	0.0
Yeah the tower is easier	You have you have a tower of three and you  have you know two colors	4.0
You have you have a tower of three and you  have you know two colors	So one its either  you know Color x and two of color y	4.0
So one its either  you know Color x and two of color y	Well  this is direction x and two two directions of y  you know	4.0
Well  this is direction x and two two directions of y  you know	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	of y	3.0
of y	So that makes that makes sense	0.0
So that makes that makes sense	So for like the three it would be two x one y  or two y one x	4.0
So for like the three it would be two x one y  or two y one x	Yeah I got that	1.0
Yeah I got that	And this would be	1.0
Well where Im still having a little  trouble is um  Okay so youre talking about  these blocks right	Mm hmm	0.0
Which is  the A and which is the B and why is it okay to  call them As and Bs	Well do it how about x and y	3.0
Sure	x will be the ones that go horizontal	3.0
Okay	And y will be the ones that go up and down  basic graphing skills	3.0
Does that make any sense Brian	Yeah	1.0

Can I ask you a question	Yeah	0.0
See if I can find out how many outfits with three different  color shirts	It would be twelve	3.0
Well lets see	Like everything goes with black	0.0
Like everything goes with black	Cause six plus six is twelve	4.0
You got a black pair	Now what were the colors of the shirt	2.0
Now what were the colors of the shirt	White black yellow	3.0
White black yellow	It s gunna be twelve	1.0
It s gunna be twelve	It s gunna be twelve	1.0
It s gunna be twelve	White black wait blue and yellow	4.0
White black wait blue and yellow	And then we have  white blue and black	4.0
And then we have  white blue and black	Okay lets see White  and  nine Dana it s nine	4.0
Okay lets see White  and  nine Dana it s nine	Okay	0.0
Okay	No Dana first I want you to figure it out we may get  different answers	1.0
No Dana first I want you to figure it out we may get  different answers	Look see you got white white and white	4.0
Look see you got white white and white	That s three	4.0
That s three	Then yellow yellow and yellow	4.0
Then yellow yellow and yellow	That s three  that s six	4.0
That s three  that s six	And then blue blue blue that s nine	4.0
And then blue blue blue that s nine	That only makes one two three four five six	1.0
That only makes one two three four five six	And then we add it s nine	1.0
And then we add it s nine	So Dana your calculations were wrong	1.0
So Dana your calculations were wrong	The answer is nine	1.0
The answer is nine	Okay Dana for the second problem I get to write okay	0.0
Okay Dana for the second problem I get to write okay	And I get to draw	0.0
And I get to draw	Because if you can get three from each one of these	4.0
Because if you can get three from each one of these	We did it it s nine	4.0
How did you get nine	We just drew lines again	0.0
We just drew lines again	See we drew shirts and since each one of them can go to  three pairs of jeans three six nine	4.0
Oh three six nine	Because there are three pairs and shirts and three pairs of  pants	4.0
Because there are three pairs and shirts and three pairs of  pants	If each shirt could go to three pairs it would be three  six nine	4.0
If each shirt could go to three pairs it would be three  six nine	Three on top three on the bottom	4.0
Think about it you don t have to do  that one	You would have to do this one like four Like three six  nine twelve	4.0
You would have to do this one like four Like three six  nine twelve	It would be twelve	4.0
It would be twelve	Three six nine twelve	4.0
You re convinced	Is twelve your lucky number Dana	0.0
Is twelve your lucky number Dana	What	0.0
What	Is twelve your lucky number	0.0
Is twelve your lucky number	Yes	0.0
Okay	You could divide that you could divide from zero to one it s the smallest of fractions	3.0
You could divide that you could divide from zero to one it s the smallest of fractions	It s easy to imagine you could divide it into zillionths	3.0
Do you want to say that one more time Alan	You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	3.0
You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	You could divide it to zillionths depending on what number inaudible	1.0
But if you made a number line to show zillionths you d have to have the longest number line in the world	That doesn t make sense even if you the only way you can divide it in zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	4.0
That doesn t make sense even if you the only way you can divide it in zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	If your one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	4.0
If your one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	Well from zero to one you could	1.0
Well from zero to one you could	If one were tenths how could you divide it into zillionths	2.0
If one were tenths how could you divide it into zillionths	Like I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust particle and you could put that on there a zillionth times	3.0
Like I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust particle and you could put that on there a zillionth times	If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	1.0
If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	I know something that is smaller than a dust particle a dust bug	1.0
I know something that is smaller than a dust particle a dust bug	100 dust bugs could fit in a dust particle	1.0
Andrew	Well if you made a number line and you if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put your number line under it	4.0
Well if you made a number line and you if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put your number line under it	You would see that you have a lot more room left to put the 100th 1000th and the 100000000th	4.0
You would see that you have a lot more room left to put the 100th 1000th and the 100000000th	What I don t understand is if you re using a microscope to give more space in actual reality you re not getting more space	1.0
Yeah that s an interesting idea Eric	You see when you re using a microscope it looks like you re getting more space but in actual reality you re not getting anymore	3.0
You see when you re using a microscope it looks like you re getting more space but in actual reality you re not getting anymore	It just looks like you are	3.0
It just looks like you are	Actually you are because the human eye cant	4.0
Actually you are because the human eye cant	Right when you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and the zero	1.0
Right when you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and the zero	Yeah Alan but what you were saying before you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more space on that number line	1.0
Yeah Alan but what you were saying before you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more space on that number line	No that s not what I m saying	1.0
No that s not what I m saying	You were saying that before	1.0
You were saying that before	Well I think that that you can t really see it too well but if you use a microscope then you re seeing it closer it looks like you re seeing more	4.0
Well I think that that you can t really see it too well but if you use a microscope then you re seeing it closer it looks like you re seeing more	But you re really not you re just looking closer	4.0
Okay we re going to give number names for all of those little lines wouldn t that be fun	Laugh	0.0
Laugh	like this could be the size of the bar then there can be your line now if you had the hundreds which would probably go somewhere in here it would look say if it was right here	4.0
like this could be the size of the bar then there can be your line now if you had the hundreds which would probably go somewhere in here it would look say if it was right here	And then you would have all that space in there It looks like it but you really don t have that much space	4.0
And then you would have all that space in there It looks like it but you really don t have that much space	That s just if you had it really big that s how much space it would look like you see	4.0
That s just if you had it really big that s how much space it would look like you see	So that means you could divide this into halves and thirds and fourths and fifths and all of that	4.0
That s interesting	Yeah cause it looks like you have a lot of space but you really only have that tinsy winsy little space between there	4.0
Yeah cause it looks like you have a lot of space but you really only have that tinsy winsy little space between there	I mean you could take a really small pen and you could divide this up into all of these pieces	4.0
I mean you could take a really small pen and you could divide this up into all of these pieces	If you look at that with your regular eye you couldn t see that so you d have to make it bigger	4.0
Gentlemen gentlemen	Ok thats the second one	0.0
Tell me what we have here	An orange and a red	3.0
An orange and a red	And purples for thirds	3.0
And purples for thirds	And three purples	1.0
And three purples	And light green for fourths	1.0
Ok right	And um here how I used to figure it out	0.0
And um here how I used to figure it out	Twelfths	3.0
Twelfths	Oh no those are singles	3.0
Honestly Erik I could imagine if you explained to me what Im  supposed to imagine	Ok	0.0
Ill try real hard but I ll try to imagine	Suppose there are twelfths under that	3.0
I can imagine that	And you took out two of those purples and three light greens	3.0
I could imagine	It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between the  between the um um	3.0
It would take one of those twelfths to fill in the gap between the  between the um um	See	0.0
See	Two thirds and three fourths	3.0
I see that	And we came to up here	3.0
And we came to up here	So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	4.0
So Three fourths is bigger than two thirds by one twelfth	And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it would  be bigger by one twelfth or	1.0
And what we came to up here two thirds and three fourths it would  be bigger by one twelfth or	Two twentyfourths	3.0
Two twentyfourths	Because two of em equal up to a red like the orange and the	4.0
Why is it a red here and why is it a white here	Well	0.0
Well	Well because see each model is different	4.0
In what way	Because this model is bigger than this model	4.0
Because this model is bigger than this model	Erik	0.0
Erik	You could put the reds on that model and make it sixths	3.0
You could put the reds on that model and make it sixths	But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that model	2.0
But then it would be so why would we need sixths on that model	Oh yeah youre right	1.0
Oh yeah youre right	So either its one twelfth or one twentyfourths	3.0
So either its one twelfth or one twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths	1.0
Two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourths on this one	3.0
Two twentyfourths on this one	This is probably the only model that  can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd have to halve each  white to get twentyfourths there	4.0
This is probably the only model that  can get the twentyfourths cuz you cant youd have to halve each  white to get twentyfourths there	But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	2.0
But what if you get three three um uh three oranges together	We tried that already	1.0
We tried that already	No we didnt we could get like fiftieths	1.0
You think it would be fiftieths if there would be three oranges	Well I dont know exactly but it would be a lot	3.0
Do you still expect that you would get the same answer	Well we can divide it	3.0
Well we can divide it	Looking at this it would not be fiftieths	3.0
Why not	Im imagining a this  instead of the purple  there	3.0
Instead of the purple	It would take another six of those so it would only be thirtieths	4.0
Id like you to try that other model	Three oranges	0.0
Id like you to find a third  model thinking big	Ok	0.0
Ok	We could think real big	0.0
And see what you come up if you work on that	Dr Martino said the key is think big so	0.0
Well maybe well see if it works	So now were gonna think real big	0.0
So now were gonna think real big	Yeah four of em	0.0
Yeah four of em	Three give me three of these	0.0
Three give me three of these	Let me just put these back	0.0
Let me just put these back	Four of em that would be right	1.0
Four of em that would be right	Fiftieths I told ya	1.0
Fiftieths I told ya	Four of em make four then it would be two yellows	4.0
Four of em make four then it would be two yellows	Friar tuck may I have them	0.0

Alan Friar Tucks have to go around ok	Uh what do you need	2.0
Uh what do you need	Im probably going to need whites	3.0
Im probably going to need whites	How many	2.0
How many	Well its going to be fiftieths and we only have twentyeight	3.0
Well its going to be fiftieths and we only have twentyeight	Ok	0.0
Ok	So were going to need about fifty thousand	3.0
So were going to need about fifty thousand	Were going for three	3.0

You might want to study you might want to study Andrews model  to see what you have to do to make it bigger	Well thats the exact same thing we did	1.0
Well thats the exact same thing we did	We did two oranges and a  purple	3.0
Yeah but I want you to make one bigger than his	Were trying but we can only divide it into one two three four fi  fifths	3.0
Were trying but we can only divide it into one two three four fi  fifths	I can divide it into thirds but I cant divide it into fourths	3.0

Yeah if you make two browns two blues are thirds	If you can make  a train for a whole you can make a train for a third and a fourth	4.0
If you can make  a train for a whole you can make a train for a third and a fourth	Ohhh	0.0
Ohhh	Thats very  interesting	0.0
Thats very  interesting	Thats an interesting theory	0.0
Thats an interesting theory	Why dont you test the  theory with Michael and Alan I think they would like to hear this  theory	0.0
Why dont you test the  theory with Michael and Alan I think they would like to hear this  theory	Would you like to hear  I think David has a theory  why  dont you come over here	0.0
Would you like to hear  I think David has a theory  why  dont you come over here	They have an interesting	0.0
They have an interesting	So do they have a theory	0.0
If you look at one model and you look at another and you look  at another do you see any connections	Well	0.0
Do you understand my question	Yeah I think so on the second question well um both my models  were um like in this shape like that	3.0
Maybe you can build that  one on the overhead when were finished	Cuz I think this was	0.0
Ok so if you were comparing three quarters  and two thirds how would you do it with that model	Um wait this would be one whole this is one half and one of these  would be one fourth	3.0
But were doing three quarters and  two thirds	Well cuz this was I think was on the second question	0.0
Right but now were doing three quarters and two thirds	Lets see um	0.0
I couldnt help but overhearing that and Im also talking to  David here but I have a question for you and David to think about  Ok	Mmm hmmm	0.0
He was doing a  different problem right David	Or it would be bigger by	4.0
Just listen to the rest of what shes says David for a minute	Or it could be bigger by two twentyfourths	3.0
So Ill leave	I think I have some um models	0.0
I think so too	But I just cant remember them	0.0
But Meredith can  you share this with David and then Ill be back because then Ill want  to hear from it in a little bit	This  is called the one these  are  the fourths and these  are the thirds and these are twelfths	4.0
This  is called the one these  are  the fourths and these  are the thirds and these are twelfths	Its if you take two thirds three fourths	4.0
Its if you take two thirds three fourths	Yeah I know I made the same model	1.0
Yeah I know I made the same model	Its bigger by one twelfth	3.0
Its bigger by one twelfth	Easy	0.0
Easy	Thats what I kept on doing but what I m saying is this	0.0
Thats what I kept on doing but what I m saying is this	I kept on  making the same shape when I did my models like that	3.0
I kept on  making the same shape when I did my models like that	Why don t you just work with me because we dont have really a lot  of cubes	2.0
Why don t you just work with me because we dont have really a lot  of cubes	I had a lot of models I just cant really remember any of them	0.0
I had a lot of models I just cant really remember any of them	I was  working on the second question	0.0
I was  working on the second question	I need ones	0.0
I need ones	Can I use these ones	0.0
Can I use these ones	I really need ones	0.0
I really need ones	I  need twentyfour ones	0.0
I  need twentyfour ones	inaudible	0.0
inaudible	Do you have any more reds over there	0.0
Do you have any more reds over there	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Three those are the four fourths	3.0
Three those are the four fourths	And these are the three thirds	3.0
And these are the three thirds	And so so they only asked for two thirds so I took out one third	4.0
And so so they only asked for two thirds so I took out one third	And they only asked for three fourths so I took out one right there	4.0
And they only asked for three fourths so I took out one right there	And then they said how how much bigger is it and I said by one  twelfth and I put it right there and thats how I got it	4.0
And then they said how how much bigger is it and I said by one  twelfth and I put it right there and thats how I got it	Well well it ittakes it takes twelve of these to equal up to one to  equal up to all that	4.0
Well well it ittakes it takes twelve of these to equal up to one to  equal up to all that	So its one twelfth	4.0
So its one twelfth	Yeah yeah	0.0
Yeah yeah	I was just going to say that	0.0
I was just going to say that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	This is the same one	0.0
This is the same one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	We want each to have two different models	0.0
We want each to have two different models	Brian wants to have two models of his own and I want to have two  models of my own	0.0
Brian wants to have two models of his own and I want to have two  models of my own	You dont have to fill it up all you have to do is put it in there	0.0
You know  a suggestion I have Alan and Erik if you can find another table  whos solving the same problem maybe you can combine	Well we need a lot more pieces	0.0
Well we need a lot more pieces	Well	0.0
Ok where are we	If you call this a one these fourths these thirds and these twelfths  and these twentyfourths	4.0
If you call this a one these fourths these thirds and these twelfths  and these twentyfourths	And you take three thirds two thirds three  fourths and two thirds its bigger by one twelfth or two twenty fourths	4.0
You found in this model that three  quarters was bigger than two thirds by	One twelfth	3.0
You found in this model that three quarters was  bigger than two thirds by	Two twelfths two	3.0
Two twelfths  by one twelfth	Yeah one twelfth	3.0
Can you predict it in your minds  and maybe sketch it or	It would probably be a much much bigger because if the model is  say this big it would need more reds and more whites than these   cause these are small	4.0
I  need you to think about that	It depends how big the uh model is	3.0
Ok	I think that this one  might be one twentyfourth  because	3.0
I think that this one  might be one twentyfourth  because	No because these are twenty fourths	4.0
No because these are twenty fourths	These are twelfths	4.0
These are twelfths	Well if it  was double the size of this	4.0
Well if it  was double the size of this	Yeah I know then this would be one twentyfourth and then this  would be one one fortyeighth or something yeah one fortyeighth	4.0
Yeah I know then this would be one twentyfourth and then this  would be one one fortyeighth or something yeah one fortyeighth	Question then we might be using something like this and this would  be something like one twelfth or something	4.0
Question then we might be using something like this and this would  be something like one twelfth or something	three quarters and if you take one of the twelfths and you put it  down here it fits	1.0
Hmmm thats really interesting	And this is the same here	3.0
Is that another model there Audra	Yeah yeah cuz this is the same here cuz this is the same size  because theres the same purples and it will fit twelve	4.0
You have four greens  and you have three purples its just that here you have is it really  different though	Not really	0.0
What number name is this	Thats a whole and thats a whole	3.0
What number name did you give it	What number name	0.0
Are the lengths the same or  different	Theyre the same	3.0
Are these models I guess this is my question to you  are they really different	No	0.0
Can you think of another	Audra can you help me That one	2.0
Audra can you help me That one	You dont need halves	3.0
You dont need halves	I know but its easier for me to find it	1.0
And what rod would you use to represent one twelfth in that model	In this one	0.0
Yeah	Hmmm probably this one lets see just a second	0.0
Just think backward	Just a second Ill try and measure	0.0
Its the red	I know I know	0.0
So you think youre going to use red to represent one twelfth	I think	0.0
I think	I also came up I just came up with just came up with the  oh here it is	0.0
I also came up I just came up with just came up with the  oh here it is	Nope I didnt get up to another model	0.0
Nope I didnt get up to another model	Yes I think I have fourths Mike Mike wait Mike wait I have one   I think I have one	3.0
Yes I think I have fourths Mike Mike wait Mike wait I have one   I think I have one	We already tried that one	0.0
We already tried that one	Im frustrated	0.0
Im frustrated	I never thought this problem would be this hard	0.0
You might want to study Andrews model to see what you have to do  to make it bigger	We did  we did two oranges and	3.0
Right but I want you to make one bigger than that	I can divide it into thirds but I cant divide it into fourths	3.0
Maybe you gotta make it bigger	Ok lets try to go to thirty	0.0
Ok lets try to go to thirty	Lets maybe try to go to thirty	0.0
Lets maybe try to go to thirty	This is  twentyfour we need to make it six more	4.0
This is  twentyfour we need to make it six more	What is six	2.0
What is six	One two  you dont really need this anymore	1.0
One two  you dont really need this anymore	I do	1.0
I do	You dont really need that one	1.0
You dont really need that one	Well I have an idea	0.0
Yeah	Well say we called it thirty	3.0
Thirty	Yeah um model	0.0
Yeah um model	Thirty of the  thirty ones and	3.0
Youre using thirty white ones to make your train is that what youre  telling me	Yeah	0.0
Will it work	No not thirty white ones you would add a six block which would  be I think would be this six  yeah so this is six	4.0
No not thirty white ones you would add a six block which would  be I think would be this six  yeah so this is six	That  would make thirty and you would call the oranges thirds	4.0
Would that work	And some of	0.0
Well try building that and tell me if that works	Ok	0.0
Why dont you try	I also thought of um	0.0
Would it be easier for  you to put your chair here do you think	Well I was also thinking about the other one	0.0
Well I was also thinking about the other one	It was um it was um  twice the size of that  Then	3.0
Hold on lets hear what David says	Then this then the red would be um one twentyfourth the whites  would be I think that would be one fortyeighth	3.0
Oh so youre saying that if it would be twice the size	And then this  would be one twelfth	3.0
They have an interesting  David has  an interesting theory I dont know if Meredith heard it tell them his  theory now listen carefully Jackie you want to hear this theory	They  already had a theory I heard it	0.0
Ok lets hear Davids theory	Well before	0.0
You know this model gentlemen dont you	Yeah	0.0
Ok Im  ready to listen	Well before we had this other one um where the whites were one  twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth	4.0
Well before we had this other one um where the whites were one  twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth	But then if we double  that then the reds would be one twentyfourth the whites would be  one fortyeighth and then the light green would be one twelfth	4.0
Alan is making a face	I just I	0.0
I just I	No meaning	0.0
Youre thinking thats possible	I heard what Andrew said was	0.0
I would suggest that all of you get your blocks together and pick a  spot on the floor over there	But I heard	0.0
And take some mats	But I overheard Andrews  Andrews doing what hes doin is hes  makin a train for the wholes and he said if you could make a train  for one whole why cant you make a train for the thirds and the  fourths	2.0
Let me make a suggestion	If you put floormats  on the floor over there by Chris whos running the camera	0.0
And took all your  hell manage  and take all your rods all your  boxes why dont you try building Davids model and see if it works	Um but	0.0
Because youll need  the blocks	What was yours before	0.0
What was yours before	Was it like two blues no	0.0
Remember what this is though	No one blue one black and um one	3.0
No one blue one black and um one	No one blue one brown and one black	1.0
No one blue one brown and one black	They did the same model	1.0

I dont want to break your train of thought but whats happening  here	Well see we took the three oranges and the dark green to be one  and then the four blues to be um the fourths and down here we  took three blues and then uh nine whites and we took three whites  which would go to that one so were making a new rod because if  you had one itd be an orange	4.0
Well see we took the three oranges and the dark green to be one  and then the four blues to be um the fourths and down here we  took three blues and then uh nine whites and we took three whites  which would go to that one so were making a new rod because if  you had one itd be an orange	If you had two other ones itd  be  bigger than an orange so were making a new rod there and we do  the same here and the same here so were making new rods for  thirds	4.0

Yeah I know thats why	And everyone is trying to make another model	0.0

And then they built something else	Yeah we forgot the whole point why we came here	0.0
Yeah we forgot the whole point why we came here	Yeah I told everybody and then she said to go over there and build  Davids model	0.0
Yeah I told everybody and then she said to go over there and build  Davids model	And we lost the point for some reason	0.0
Ok but I dont think David did this	No Davids like here let me do this	0.0
David how about you explain to me what youre doing so your thinking	Well before Meredith built this other thing and then she had the reds  were one twelfth and then the whites were one twentyfourth but  then	1.0
Well before Meredith built this other thing and then she had the reds  were one twelfth and then the whites were one twentyfourth but  then	We built that me and alan built that and then they did it and then	1.0
We built that me and alan built that and then they did it and then	Meredith did too but then uh so then uh she thought to think of a  bigger model then I thought that then maybe the greens would be  something like one twelfth but then we figured out that would be  sixteenths then I put them up there	4.0
Alright	And	0.0
And	No it wouldnt this one still has some room	1.0
No it wouldnt this one still has some room	I think	0.0
I think	No its just that this	0.0
No its just that this	Well um and then I thought the  reds would be one twentyfourth and the whites might be one forty eighth	4.0
Well um and then I thought the  reds would be one twentyfourth and the whites might be one forty eighth	Cuz I just doubled it	4.0
Did it work out	What	0.0
I mean did you did you find what you thought you  would find	Well not really because this one was one sixteenth um one  sixteenth	4.0
And the reds came out to	I was working on that right now	0.0
Oh ok	What about the purples	2.0
What about the purples	How about the purples	2.0
How about the purples	The purples could  come out to be	3.0
The purples could  come out to be	Yeah they might be the	1.0
Yeah they might be the	I think the purples would be the purples would probably be twelfths	3.0
I think the purples would be the purples would probably be twelfths	Alright so now	0.0
You put a lot of work into it	This isnt going to fit on notebook paper	0.0
We can take listen we can take this and paste it together and put  your work on	Well it barely even fits on this	0.0
We can do that	I mean if it doesnt fit on this of course it cant fit on a single piece  of notebook paper but if we put a couple of pieces together	0.0
What should we	I think maybe I counted wrong but that but I counted it to be one  twentythird	3.0
I think maybe I counted wrong but that but I counted it to be one  twentythird	Let me count again	0.0

I think the ones would be one fortyeighth	Wait four eight twelve just count by fours cuz	3.0
Wait four eight twelve just count by fours cuz	David and Erik Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen  twenty twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight	3.0
David and Erik Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen  twenty twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight	Thirty	1.0
Thirty	Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty  twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight thirty thirtytwo  thirtyfour thirtysix thirtyeight forty fortytwo fortyfour forty six fortyeight	3.0
Two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty  twentytwo twentyfour twentysix twentyeight thirty thirtytwo  thirtyfour thirtysix thirtyeight forty fortytwo fortyfour forty six fortyeight	Yep fortyeight	3.0
Are you surprised that its fortyeight	No thats what I thought it would be	3.0
Are you going to be able to  write this up	Um well not draw maybe not	0.0
So you  can start	Cuz I thought the greens were the purples one twelfth	4.0
Cuz I thought the greens were the purples one twelfth	So I think what Im gonna do	0.0
So you think the purples one twelfth  is there another name for that  purple	Um one one	3.0
Meredith knows how to find other names for these	One twelfth	3.0
Is there another number name for the  purple	One fourth no	3.0
One fourth no	I mean uh whats it called	3.0
I mean uh whats it called	Wait	0.0
If you were using	One whole	3.0
If let me ask you this	One whole one half	3.0
Um	Four twelfths	3.0
Ok David thinks four twelfths	One twelfth	1.0
One twelfth	One twelfth	1.0
We know its one twelfth weve proved its one twelfth and youve  proved its one twelfth	Four twentyeighths	3.0
Four twentyeighths	I mean four fortyeighths	3.0
Four fortyeighths	Because the whites would be the whites would be fortyeighths and  then and then it takes	4.0
Because the whites would be the whites would be fortyeighths and  then and then it takes	I didnt mean	0.0
I didnt mean	Four whites to equal up	3.0
Four whites to equal up	Four twelfths	1.0
Four twelfths	Four fortyeighths	1.0
You mean four fortyeighths	I said four fortyeighths	0.0
You think that makes sense	Four fortyeighths or	3.0
Four fortyeighths or	One twelfth	1.0
One twelfth	One twelfth	1.0
Any other  names	Oh wait	0.0
Oh wait	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Two two two twentyfourths	3.0
Two twentyfourths	Two twenty fourths	0.0
How many different number names and different  blocks	Well does it have to be the same whole	2.0
What do you think	It can also be bigger by um	3.0
It can also be bigger by um	Two or it can be thirds halves it could be a	1.0
What s one green	Those are sixteenths	3.0
Those are sixteenths	One sixteenth and one fortyeighth	1.0
One sixteenth	Or one fortyeighth	3.0
How did you get sixteenths	Because there are sixteen that line up to the answer	4.0
Because there are sixteen that line up to the answer	One sixteenth	1.0
Show me they re sixteen	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen	0.0
But is the difference between three  quarters and two thirds a green	Is the difference between	3.0
Is the difference between	Oh a green and blue one fortyeighth	1.0
So how would what number name would you give for the  differences between	Also the it also could be it would take two of them to equal up to a  brown	4.0
Were up to  seventh grade math already	Seventh	0.0
So I think you could work it out if you worked hard enough	Yeah but I think if you took one sixteenth and one forty eighth and  you put it up to it it	3.0
Oh so what number name would you give to that	Uh one forty eighth  I dont	3.0
Danielle	I would call it 112	3.0
Ok Danielle why do you think 112	Because the red and the orange thats the  whole and 12 white ones make up the  whole	4.0
I would like you all to think  about for a minute maybe even to discuss it  with your partner what you might call these	has told us part of this you just  have to put it into the sentence now	0.0
has told us part of this you just  have to put it into the sentence now	6	0.0
Read me read me what it says there	How many whites are in a red and orange  train	0.0
Well you said	Uh twelve	3.0
How many	How many blank are in	0.0
What would you call one of these	A twelfth	3.0
So how many blanks are in  You said  how many twelfths are in	A whole	3.0
Are in one right you have it	I do	0.0
Read the second line	How many twelfths are in a whole	0.0
Ok wait maybe Im wrong  what did you say	How many twelfths are in one	3.0
Ok lets  see I havent had a chance to  David	The white would be 112 and the red and  orange train would be 1 whole	3.0
Let me hear from Graham	There is 12 twelfths	3.0
So then youre telling me that how many  112s are in 1 is 12	Yeah	0.0
Now Erik did you have something that you  wanted to add	For that equation well you could put how  many 112s there are in 1 you can also put  how many 112s are there in 1212s	3.0
So I could also rewrite this youre  saying then as 12 over 12	Yeah	0.0
Are  they the same thing	Yes	0.0
If you have an idea about that raise  your hand	What did he say about 112	2.0
How could we rewrite this as  a math sentence as a number sentence	One divided by one sixth equals  six	4.0
One divided by one sixth equals  six	One  whole minus six sixths is zero	4.0
One  whole minus six sixths is zero	One whole	4.0
One whole	One whole minus	1.0
One whole minus	five sixths equals one sixth	4.0
five sixths equals one sixth	No no no no no	1.0
No no no no no	I have an idea	0.0
I have an idea	No	0.0
No	No give  me a pencil	0.0
No give  me a pencil	Look this is one	0.0
Look this is one	One is equal to  six sixths	4.0
One is equal to  six sixths	Does it have to be division	0.0
Does it have to be division	Does it  have to be a division problem	0.0
Does it  have to be a division problem	One divided by six is not six sixths	1.0
One divided by six is not six sixths	I didnt say it was	1.0
I didnt say it was	One divided by I  think if youre doing a division problem you  could do one divided by one sixth equal six  because it was like what we did when our  parents were here we did one divided by  one eighth equals eight so it was like well  what how many eighths are in one	4.0
Do you agree with that Danielle	Uh yeah but I so its like every number its  that its one divided by the fraT2ion and then  just the plain number	1.0
What do you think	Well uh	0.0
I  think thats something we need to do some  more exploring with to see if that works so  well do some more problems to see if thats  the case	Its just like saying six divided by uh it  would be like the same thing kind of	4.0
Its just like saying six divided by uh it  would be like the same thing kind of	Six  divided by one sixth equals what	4.0
Six  divided by one sixth equals what	And then  you check it	4.0
I dont want to just give you the  answer on that I want you to think about it  some more	One whole	3.0
So these are  your sixths	Yeah mm hmm	0.0
Think about that	One	0.0
One	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Wait of course I can	0.0
Wait of course I can	One whole  nah six sixths divided by	3.0
One whole  nah six sixths divided by	One divided by one sixth equals	1.0
One divided by one sixth equals	I  know	0.0
I  know	One divided by one sixth equals six  sixths	4.0
One divided by one sixth equals six  sixths	What	2.0
What	That doesnt make sense	1.0
That doesnt make sense	How do you spell division	0.0
How do you spell division	DIVISION  something like that	0.0
DIVISION  something like that	No youre not taking away when you divide	1.0
Thats  a good question	No youre doing subtraT2ion	3.0
No youre doing subtraT2ion	No see	1.0
No see	Do we have a pen	0.0
How is it related to subtraT2ion Michael	See look	0.0
And one divided by one sixth equals six  because theres six one sixths in one	Yeah thats what I mean	0.0
Yeah thats what I mean	So six divided by one if you do six times one	3.0
So six divided by one if you do six times one	But she said six sixths I would agree with  six but not six sixths	1.0
But she said six sixths I would agree with  six but not six sixths	equals six minus equals zero	4.0
equals six minus equals zero	Its uh one  divided by one sixth	4.0
Alright	But not six sixths	1.0
Why dont you tell me first and then if we  need to build a model we may have you come  up and do that	Well we have 1 divided by 16 equals 6	4.0
I want somebody to come up and  tell me about this now about how this  describes this sentence	They had one I dont know if they want to do  it	0.0
If this works how does it work	It works because division you see how many  times you can get a number into a number	4.0
It works because division you see how many  times you can get a number into a number	So you can get 16 umm you can get 6 times  you can get 16 into 1 with no remainders	4.0
So you can get 16 umm you can get 6 times  you can get 16 into 1 with no remainders	So that would leave that that would be 6	4.0
So youre saying then that 16	You can have 6 of them	3.0
It goes into 1 if you were lining them up	6 times	3.0
Does that make sense	How can 6 go into 1 six times	2.0
How can 6 go into 1 six times	No I said	1.0
No I said	1 whole but if youre dealing with numbers  it wouldnt make sense unless it was  negative	4.0
1 whole but if youre dealing with numbers  it wouldnt make sense unless it was  negative	No I mean no 1 divided by 16 when you  ha you would get 6	4.0
No I mean no 1 divided by 16 when you  ha you would get 6	I know but Im saying if you were taking like  6 and 1 you couldnt put 66s into 1	4.0
I know but Im saying if you were taking like  6 and 1 you couldnt put 66s into 1	No I never said that	1.0
Erik I dont think thats what Michael said  though	I know	0.0
Youre  taking this to a challenge problem here I  think	Hes just trying to say that theres 66s is 1  whole	1.0
Ok what  do you call this	One	3.0
What do you call this	One twelfth	3.0
If I do one divided by one twelfth what do I  get	Um twelve	3.0
Do you have twelve parts here	Um yeah	0.0
Tell me how youd write the number  sentence	I would write it 1 divided by 112 equals 12	4.0
And the two fractions we were comparing were as  Michael said	One half and one third	3.0
One half and one third and when we were comparing them we asked  by how much some of you came up with a solution to that which  was	One sixth	3.0
Some of you may be explaining Jessica s argument when you write  to us this weekend	Umm there s not enough reds for there	4.0
Umm there s not enough reds for there	Well umm well I I have this I counted as my one whole and that  was my one half but then this my one third it s not it doesn t I have  my this is one sixth	4.0
Well umm well I I have this I counted as my one whole and that  was my one half but then this my one third it s not it doesn t I have  my this is one sixth	This is one sixth	4.0
This is one sixth	The red is one sixth and I and  I didn t think um one third was right now because one third is  smaller  umm one this is one third and I put that here because I  wanted to show how that this red here how it takes two reds	4.0
The red is one sixth and I and  I didn t think um one third was right now because one third is  smaller  umm one this is one third and I put that here because I  wanted to show how that this red here how it takes two reds	Wait I  forget what I was going to say	0.0
Wait I  forget what I was going to say	I forget all what I was going to say	0.0
I forget all what I was going to say	Umm Erik	0.0
Umm Erik	I think that what you re trying to say	1.0
I think that what you re trying to say	And then what I think  is that if you take one of the dark greens which is the half it equ it s  larger than one uh third but yet if you put another third onto the um  the um dark green I mean not to the dark green to the uh purple to  the other third that third is larger than it	4.0
And then what I think  is that if you take one of the dark greens which is the half it equ it s  larger than one uh third but yet if you put another third onto the um  the um dark green I mean not to the dark green to the uh purple to  the other third that third is larger than it	So then If you put it like if you put one of the red rods well  it s sm like I said it s smaller the third the one third is smaller than  the one half and one of these red ones these the reds are sixths if  you put the red on top of the pink uh the purple it equals up to the  exact same size as the dark green	4.0
So then If you put it like if you put one of the red rods well  it s sm like I said it s smaller the third the one third is smaller than  the one half and one of these red ones these the reds are sixths if  you put the red on top of the pink uh the purple it equals up to the  exact same size as the dark green	Yeah that s what I was trying to say	1.0
Let s hear what he has to say  alright so we had one argument to choose but we have Alan and he  has a different one	Okay I used the dark green and um and I used the light greens for the  halves and the red rods for the thirds and then I took the white rods  and put them up against the reds	4.0
Okay I used the dark green and um and I used the light greens for the  halves and the red rods for the thirds and then I took the white rods  and put them up against the reds	And those would be the halves	4.0
And those would be the halves	So I took  that out because that would be a half and that would be a third and  one of these would be one sixth so I put that up to here and it took  one sixth to complete so it s the half is bigger than a third by one  sixth	4.0
Do you agree Jessica	No	1.0
Jessica doesn t agree	I think he s like remember you said that it can be only be one size  candy bar and that s like a whole different size candy bar he s  making	4.0
Kelly	Well me and Jacqueline agree	1.0
Why do you agree	Well because when you go to the store there s not just one size  candy bar there s all different kinds of sizes so you can make a  model with a different size	4.0
Ok  Michael	I agree with it because um it can be done because there s like six  whites equal up to one green and then it takes one white plus a red to  equal a light green which is half so that would be one sixth	4.0
I agree with it because um it can be done because there s like six  whites equal up to one green and then it takes one white plus a red to  equal a light green which is half so that would be one sixth	Yeah but it s I think it still could be one sixth but it s just a  different size candy bar	4.0
Yeah but it s I think it still could be one sixth but it s just a  different size candy bar	Yeah I know we said any one sixth is right	1.0
What do you think Jessica was  confused about then	Yeah the sixth isn t the same size	3.0
This is a model where um	Yeah because the whole is not the same size	4.0
Jessica	But because say if you wanted to give someone one sixth of that  candy bar and then you were going to give someone one sixth of the  other one then the person with that size would get a smaller amount	4.0
What do you think	Well um that s right because if um it s just a different size candy  bar	4.0
Well um that s right because if um it s just a different size candy  bar	If you just gave half of that to the person and the other half of  that to another person you would still have the same size	4.0
If you just gave half of that to the person and the other half of  that to another person you would still have the same size	You can t  switch the candy bars	4.0
In this problem	Well they didn t switch a candy bar in that problem but from the  problem that Jessica that Jessica did he switched the candy bar  they switched the candy bar from the orange and the red to the dark  green and if you re giving someone half of the orange and red and  someone else half of the dark green the person getting half of the  orange and the red is getting a bigger piece	4.0
That s true but are we doing that	No	0.0
Michael	What Jessica was confused about is she didn t think it would be  right because they you had a different size one sixth but he also  switched the whole so the whole is smaller by one white	4.0
Andrew	The white	3.0
One  was Beth	Orange and red	3.0
Beth	Twelve I mean wait	3.0
What number name what rod what  rod had the number name one sixth	Oh um a red	3.0
Ok hw many  think you know the answer to that some of you have built a James	aren t really sure	0.0
What do you think	I think its one sixth	3.0
You think the white is one sixth	Yeah	0.0
Okay so James isn t sure but he thinks its one sixth Brian	Is it one twelfth	3.0
Ok Laura	One tenth	3.0
Okay what s the number name for the white when  you have an orange and red	Yo yo	0.0
Yo yo	One sixth	3.0
One sixth	Count the ones	1.0
Count the ones	No We re working with orange and red	1.0
No We re working with orange and red	No We re working with that	1.0
No We re working with that	We re working with that model	3.0
Orange and red is one	We are working with orange and red	3.0
We are working with orange and red	Oh Orange and red	4.0
Oh Orange and red	Then it s twelve	4.0
Then it s twelve	Yes I know	1.0
Yes I know	One twelfth	3.0
He thinks he s  going to argue for why he s changing his mind	Okay	0.0
If we call the orange and red one	Now I think it might be one twelfth cause orange and orange and  red equals twelve white ones	4.0
Now I think it might be one twelfth cause orange and orange and  red equals twelve white ones	So umm	0.0
It s hard  let me help you by holding this still	And its one twelfth cause there s one two three four five six seven  eight nine ten eleven twelve	4.0
Thank you James	Well um a dark green is half of one orange I mean orange and red  and then the dark green has six blocks six whites and if you have  two dark greens six and six is twelve	4.0
Well um a dark green is half of one orange I mean orange and red  and then the dark green has six blocks six whites and if you have  two dark greens six and six is twelve	And that s why we think its  twelve	4.0
But I heard Sarah something even different than that	Umm I said that umm you have six of these reds	4.0
Umm I said that umm you have six of these reds	If you times these  by two you d get twelve	4.0
If you times them by two why would you times them by two Sara	Because if you had if you put two next two little ones right on the  bottom of the red it would equal two	4.0
Because if you had if you put two next two little ones right on the  bottom of the red it would equal two	So you would go two times	4.0
Can t why	Um	0.0
Who thinks they can write about them two different ways and why  Kelly	I think I can write about them because now I understand which or  how is what one goes cause now there s not just one different kind  there s all different kinds	0.0
Anybody else what to say why he or she thinks Brian	Well I understand the problem and I feel that I can write about it	0.0
Both of the models	Well not both of them but the one the twelfth I can write about it	0.0
What do you mean the one twelfth Brian	The twelfths the twelve of them equal the red and the orange rod	3.0
Work with  your partner and build a model and see if you can solve it	One half or one quarter	2.0
One half or one quarter	Now I get that the quarter is	0.0
Now I get that the quarter is	Look here s a quarter	3.0
Look here s a quarter	You can t make  this into quarters	3.0
You can t make  this into quarters	A quarter is four parts	3.0
A quarter is four parts	But you  could make this  into a quarter	3.0
But you  could make this  into a quarter	Ah hah	0.0
Ah hah	By taking	0.0
By taking	Actually you can t make it into a quarter	1.0
Actually you can t make it into a quarter	What	2.0
What	I don t think you can well actually you can these these will  probably	3.0
I don t think you can well actually you can these these will  probably	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	1.0
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	two three four	0.0
two three four	Now we eliminate that	3.0
Now we eliminate that	One half is  bigger than one quarter by one quarter	4.0
One half is  bigger than one quarter by one quarter	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	That was easy	0.0
That was easy	Hey now I quartered it so I can put these  back on	4.0
Hey now I quartered it so I can put these  back on	There we go	0.0
There we go	That s yours where s mine	0.0
That s yours where s mine	There it is	0.0
There it is	There we go	0.0
There we go	A whole model and only sized that	3.0
Ok I see one model up there and there s another one maybe Amy  and uh James you could build your model when their finished	Hey there s another thing you can quarter	3.0
Hey there s another thing you can quarter	Look	0.0
Look	There s two ways	3.0
There s two ways	Oh	0.0
Oh	You can quarter a train of orange rods	3.0
Let s see if you can find one that I haven t  seen yet	I wonder if you can quarter this	4.0
I wonder if you can quarter this	I got another  one	4.0
I got another  one	All you have to do is keep going down by two	4.0
All you have to do is keep going down by two	Brown you minus two take that rod and you can quarter that one	4.0
Brown you minus two take that rod and you can quarter that one	Brown black then dark green	4.0
Brown black then dark green	Dark green can t be quartered no it can t	1.0
Dark green can t be quartered no it can t	Two dark greens	1.0
Two dark greens	We got it	0.0
We got it	We have an answer	0.0
We have an answer	We have four different  models	3.0
So you re going to explain how you got your different models  Alan	We re subtracting by two	4.0
We re subtracting by two	Two down from the orange would be the  brown	4.0
I  want you to hear this	four already	3.0
four already	So two from the brown  would be yellow	3.0
So two from the brown  would be yellow	Two from the brown would be two yellows	1.0
Two from the brown would be two yellows	Yellows reds	1.0
Yellows reds	What no	1.0
What no	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	No	1.0
No	You can t quarter the yellow	3.0
You can t quarter the yellow	That s just the point you can t	3.0
That s just the point you can t	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Oh yeah you re right	1.0
Oh yeah you re right	Purple	3.0
Purple	Purple purple	1.0
Purple purple	That s it that s it	0.0
That s it that s it	Purple s reds then	3.0
Purple s reds then	Yeah purple	1.0
Yeah purple	Two reds for a purple	3.0
Two reds for a purple	Definitely definitely	0.0
Definitely definitely	Two minus purple would be red	4.0
Two minus purple would be red	Red	4.0
Red	Here s what we ll do	0.0
Here s what we ll do	We ll put all our fractions in this box top so  they won t break	0.0
We ll put all our fractions in this box top so  they won t break	We ll just put it on the table	0.0
We ll just put it on the table	We re ready oh no we re not	0.0
We re ready oh no we re not	Yes we are	0.0
We have a few ideas here I ve  seen about four different five different models	We have like six	0.0
Let s get	I think we may	3.0
I think we may	We have six or seven models	3.0
Let s hear it	The orange and the red would be one and the dark greens would be a  half and the light greens would be a quarter	3.0
The orange and the red would be one and the dark greens would be a  half and the light greens would be a quarter	And um it we think it will be bigger we think one half would be  bigger than one quarter by one quarter because it takes two quarters  to equal that	4.0
And um it we think it will be bigger we think one half would be  bigger than one quarter by one quarter because it takes two quarters  to equal that	And why we think that is because four is um two more  than two so it would take two fourths to equal two two pieces	4.0
And why we think that is because four is um two more  than two so it would take two fourths to equal two two pieces	Because there s four pieces and then they would have to put those  two pieces together to make two pieces	4.0
They added some extra ideas  what do you think Andrew	Is the green and the light green supposed to be uh are you going to  have the fourths to it	0.0
Is the green and the light green supposed to be uh are you going to  have the fourths to it	What do you mean	2.0
What do you mean	There s no fourths what rod is the fourths	3.0
There s no fourths what rod is the fourths	One fourth is a quarter its another name for a quarter	3.0
One fourth is a quarter its another name for a quarter	It s looks like you have a dark green there	1.0
It s looks like you have a dark green there	This is just it s one of the regular ones because we ran out of the  greens	0.0
This is just it s one of the regular ones because we ran out of the  greens	Yeah but do you have four fourths	0.0
Yeah but do you have four fourths	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	One two three four	0.0
Thank you gentlemen	Okay um we decided we tried the orange and we couldn t we just   we didn t want to make a train	4.0
Okay um we decided we tried the orange and we couldn t we just   we didn t want to make a train	We wanted to use one color and we  couldn t find any thing to make a quarter of that so we went down to  the blue we couldn t find a half of that then we went down to the  black I mean brown and then we found a half of that and a quarter  for that and so we used brown and we took two purples and we put  those underneath the brown then we took then we found red were  half of purples so we put the reds underneath the purples and then  we had to see how many whites would equal up to all the would  equal up to a brown so we kept putting them on and so we found  eight	4.0
What is bigger and by how much	James figured that out	1.0
James figured that out	One eighth	3.0
Are you convinced what James did	Yes	1.0
Yes	It s one eighth yeah we think its one eighth	3.0
Okay so James says that in this model one half is bigger than a  quarter or one quarter is bigger than a half	No one half is bigger than one quarter	3.0
By one eighth	Yeah	0.0
Kelly you disagree	Well me and Jackie have another one	0.0
I m talking about this one	Oh	0.0
Then we ll hear from some others	Well you said its bigger by an eighth are you calling this an eighth	0.0
Well you said its bigger by an eighth are you calling this an eighth	Ok Take these two	4.0
Ok Take these two	This is an eighth it is not bigger  by an eighth because there is still negative spaceYou re calling that  an eighth it s not equal	4.0
This is an eighth it is not bigger  by an eighth because there is still negative spaceYou re calling that  an eighth it s not equal	But if you take another one it could be  bigger by two eighths  and or it could be bigger by one quarter	4.0
But if you take another one it could be  bigger by two eighths  and or it could be bigger by one quarter	One  quarter or one um two eighths	4.0
One  quarter or one um two eighths	It s the only way it could be bigger  by	4.0
What do you  think about what Meredith is saying	Um	0.0
Um	Well I think we meant that all these put all together are one eighth	3.0
Well I think we meant that all these put all together are one eighth	I  think that s what we meant	0.0
I  think that s what we meant	James Yeah	0.0
James Yeah	Both these put together are one eighth	0.0
Both these put together are one eighth	No	1.0
No	We thought uh all of these whites put together were one eighth	3.0
We thought uh all of these whites put together were one eighth	That s what we thought	0.0
That s what we thought	But the question was Is one half bigger is one half bigger than one  quarter	0.0
But the question was Is one half bigger is one half bigger than one  quarter	And we said one half	1.0
And we said one half	So you think all these are one eighth	1.0
So you think all these are one eighth	And that is bigger than 18	1.0
And that is bigger than 18	The um because that s the question	0.0
The um because that s the question	The question is is one half  bigger than one quarter right	0.0
The question is is one half  bigger than one quarter right	Right	1.0
Right	You think its bigger than one eighth and all these are one eighth	1.0
You think its bigger than one eighth and all these are one eighth	So  that s how much you think its bigger by	1.0
So  that s how much you think its bigger by	No we I think we got the question wrong	1.0
What question do you think you were answering uh Miss Jackie  you think you were answering a different question I m hearing you  say	Yeah	0.0
one half bigger than one quarter	That is what we said	0.0
By how much	I think that is where we got a little wolbby	0.0
Okay so you see it s bigger by how much	Two	3.0
Two what	Two eighths	3.0
Or Meredith suggested another name for that would be	One quarter	3.0
Tell the  rest of the class who may not have who may have missed it	Well this was one quarter and all these were one quarter and these  two together make up a quarter	4.0
Ok so you are changing your answer to one quarter or two eighths	Yeah	0.0
Do you think you know  Jessica or not	Umm I am not sure well for that problem	0.0
Yes	What they mean	0.0
Yes	Umm well I don t get first they changed first they had an answer  then they changed it and well they didn t yeah they did they  changed it	1.0
Umm well I don t get first they changed first they had an answer  then they changed it and well they didn t yeah they did they  changed it	And well I m not really sure	0.0
Okay  Danielle Gregory let s hear your thinking	Well we think that the um the half which is the brown um was  bigger than the fourth because if you take the brown the half and the  fourth you could see that the half is bigger	4.0
How much bigger	By a purple	3.0
And what number name is that	A fourth	3.0
Ok lets all listen to Andrew s  um solution now and see if you agree	It s bigger by um one fourth because there and put that there	4.0
It s bigger by um one fourth because there and put that there	I  think they re all if you have the fourths on your um your problem  and I think that it would always be one fourth would be as much as  more	4.0
I  think they re all if you have the fourths on your um your problem  and I think that it would always be one fourth would be as much as  more	The half would be more than it by one fourth if you always  have a fourth	4.0
Why do you think that	Well because out of all the people that came up here they always  had the room for one more fourth and I think that because usually  the fourths or two of  em are equal up to the half so then it would  be a fourths	4.0
Erik	Well I think that we think that you could divide I think that you  could take you could take rods and divide them equally into fourths  I think six times	3.0
Well I think that we think that you could divide I think that you  could take you could take rods and divide them equally into fourths  I think six times	Well and we also came to a theory that if if you  uh yeah we also came to a theory that	0.0
Well and we also came to a theory that if if you  uh yeah we also came to a theory that	If you take an orange rod go down two it would be a brown rod	4.0
If you take an orange rod go down two it would be a brown rod	if you take an orange rod and go down two it will be the brown rod	4.0
if you take an orange rod and go down two it will be the brown rod	And you can make it into quarters and then	1.0
And you can make it into quarters and then	Yeah you just divide two from each rod like you start with the  orange rod divide by two and then the brown rod and you divide by  two from the brown rod	4.0
Yeah you just divide two from each rod like you start with the  orange rod divide by two and then the brown rod and you divide by  two from the brown rod	From the brown rod	1.0
From the brown rod	And then whatever rod you get divide two from that and keep going  down	1.0
Alan did you want to add something	We have a lot of them we need  to remember	3.0
Will your answer change when you change your  model	Um I don t think so cause it might just be in a different size but it  might be the same thing but they kind of changed it around a little  bit	4.0
One  two three four five six models Meredith has here	That s what we have too	0.0
Okay what do you think Andrew	Well you really can t tell if um you can t tell if the half is bigger  than the fourth cause right on their problems that they have they  don t have a half	4.0
Well you really can t tell if um you can t tell if the half is bigger  than the fourth cause right on their problems that they have they  don t have a half	Well we didn t do the halfs we just did the fourths	4.0
Well we didn t do the halfs we just did the fourths	Because all you  really had to do was the fourths	4.0
Because all you  really had to do was the fourths	Andrew  But the question was is one half bigger than a fourth by how much	1.0
Andrew  But the question was is one half bigger than a fourth by how much	But we think before we went up we heard other people go up and  they explained that they thought one half was bigger than one third  by one fourth so we just figured that we d just do the problem just to  show and even if we had to do the fourths or the halves half of that  would be actually would probably I m not sure but we didn t really  have them because we thought that people answered the question	4.0
But we think before we went up we heard other people go up and  they explained that they thought one half was bigger than one third  by one fourth so we just figured that we d just do the problem just to  show and even if we had to do the fourths or the halves half of that  would be actually would probably I m not sure but we didn t really  have them because we thought that people answered the question	That they d be bigger by one fourth	4.0
You all could imagine that can t you	Ohmhum	0.0
Every time I wanted to measure something I would have to count up all the ones David said didn t he	Yeah	0.0
Now this is really a very interesting idea I think because we often think of a line as going on and on and on without ending you know if I asked you what is the biggest number	Nothing	3.0
Nothing	It wouldn t be on	3.0
You can look it up	Yeah	0.0
I would say I know one bigger just add one to it right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
Our question is this line you ll learn when you get to high school geometry but you will learn this when you get to high school geometry but I know that you will learn this before you get to high school geometry we can think of as made up of lots of points	Last year in Mrs Dominica s class we studied points and ohm	3.0
Last year in Mrs Dominica s class we studied points and ohm	Segments and sections because the number line is just a section of the big line that goes on and on	4.0
That goes on for ever	forever and there is just a little section  that is taken out	3.0
You ve heard of infinity haven t you	Umhum	0.0
And so yes Brian	A lot	3.0
A lot	Yes	1.0
Yes	Infinity	1.0
Infinity	The definition of infinity is that it keeps going it never stops	3.0
How many numbers we can put on this line	No	0.0
No	It would take a long time	3.0
Yes Alan	On the number line I used one as the half mark between zero and two and	3.0
So you thought of number  one as being half way	Umhum	0.0
And where would you  place four	Hum I would probably put it there	3.0
Okay get the idea	Umhum	0.0
Do you know where you would place a million	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Down the hall	0.0
Amy what do you think	Because you can have negative	4.0
Okay so where do you think I would put negative one	Negative one	0.0
Negative one	Oh I know	0.0
You all watch and see if this makes sense	Like right there	3.0
So can we talk about why we would put it there	Well because its not exactly but that	4.0
Im guessing where would you put a negative two	Negative two would be about there	3.0
Kimberly what do you think	I think it is negative one back there because it is beyond zero	4.0
Its beyond zero	Yeah	0.0
Which way beyond zero	That way	3.0
To the left of zero	To the left of zero	0.0
And the positive one	Its beyond zero	3.0
Which way	This way	3.0
To the right	Yeah	0.0
Alan	I think that all numbers to the left of zero would be in the negative and all numbers to the  right of zero would be in the positive	3.0
Can  you read it	Integers	0.0
Can you say it	Integers	0.0
So now you know about the set of integers which you usually  study when you get to prealgebra or algebra	Thats what my brothers in	0.0
Okay	Ohm no	0.0
If I said you know make me a number  line with the integers would you know how to do that	Ohmhum	0.0
Can you show me how that works	Well I dont want it to go on forever	0.0
Well I dont want it to go on forever	What do you want us to go on to	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
We were trying to figure out what  sort of happens in between and just as we said these keep on going and there are  infinitely many what we are going to be learning over the next maybe six or seven years  of math that even in between zero and one there are also infinitely many numbers	There are	0.0
Yeah	Infinitely many	0.0
Mathematicians claim that between zero and one there are also infinitely many  numbers	Infinitely between zero and one	0.0
I  use to when my son was your age he use to think about those things	In fractions or just	2.0
In fractions or just	One million	3.0
I dont expect you to solve  that problem in your mind right now mathematicians have worked on this for centuries	I just dont understand how there can be infinitely many numbers between zero to one	2.0
I just dont understand how there can be infinitely many numbers between zero to one	Fractions  fractions	1.0
Fractions  fractions	I know why	0.0
I know why	No infinitely many numbers from zero to one	1.0
No infinitely many numbers from zero to one	It doesnt	0.0
Alan	Make sense	0.0
Make sense	You can divide that line into the smallest of fractions	3.0
You can divide that line into the smallest of fractions	You could divide it into zillionths	3.0
You could divide it into zillionths	Yeah	1.0
You want to say that  one more time Alan	You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	3.0
You could divide it into zillionths and there would still be space in there	If you had the longest number line in the world	1.0
If you had the longest number line in the world	If you divide it into zillionths depending on what number you want to hold it to	1.0
Michael Im talking about this little piece between zero and one	Yeah but you could still divide it	3.0
Yeah but you could still divide it	But if you made a number line to show zillionths then you would have to have the longest  number line in the world	4.0
But if you made a number line to show zillionths then you would have to have the longest  number line in the world	Alan	0.0
Alan	Alan	0.0
Alan	That doesnt make sense	1.0
That doesnt make sense	Yes it does	1.0
Yes it does	Even if you were to divide it into zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	1.0
Even if you were to divide it into zillionths is depending on how big your one whole is	If  you one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	4.0
If  you one whole is ten you cant divide it into zillionths	Well from zero to one you could	1.0
Well from zero to one you could	You could divide it into zillionths	3.0
You could divide it into zillionths	If you one whole is ten how could you divide it into zillionths	2.0
Erik what if you one whole is a zillion	Then you could divide it into zillionths	3.0
Well I think that is what I think Alan is saying	I know but Im just	0.0
What if your one whole you called a google	Hah	0.0
Hah	A google	0.0
A google	What if you called the zero to one a billion	3.0
What do you think Alan	Well as I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust  particle and you could put that on there a zillion times	4.0
Well as I was saying before about the zillionths you could have a line the size of a dust  particle and you could put that on there a zillion times	You would have zillionths	4.0
You would have zillionths	If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	1.0
If you had a pin that was smaller than a dust particle then	Something that is smaller than a dust particle   a dust bug   a hundred dust bug can fit  into a dust particle	1.0
Something that is smaller than a dust particle   a dust bug   a hundred dust bug can fit  into a dust particle	I wasnt talking about insects	3.0
Andrew	Well if you made a number line and you took a magnifying glass or a microscope and put  your number line under it you would see that you have a lot of room left to put the one hundredth onethousandth and the onemillionth	4.0
Did you all hear what Andrew said	Yes	0.0
Yes	If you did put it under a microscope it would look like you had enough room to put  another zero to one in there	4.0
If you did put it under a microscope it would look like you had enough room to put  another zero to one in there	It would look like that	4.0
It would look like that	You could have it enlarged so that the  line from the zero would be this big	4.0
You could have it enlarged so that the  line from the zero would be this big	And you would still have room there to put more	4.0
What happens when scientists discover more and more powerful telescopes	Than the more numbers you could fit onto one number line	3.0
What did they find	More stars	3.0
So they invented more powerful instruments and what did they find	More stars	3.0
So is it that the stars arent there or is it that we dont have the instrument	We dont have the instrument	3.0
Like Andrews example	Space	3.0
Space	If we could make more powerful microscopes then we would see more space every time  we looked through a different one	4.0
Brian	So like what Alan said you can put zillionths in	1.0
So you are sort of  agreeing that there are lots and lots of fractions between zero and one if you had this	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Even like you could even make it smaller than that and make smaller pieces to put in  there	3.0
Even like you could even make it smaller than that and make smaller pieces to put in  there	What I dont understand is that if you are using a microscope to get more space in actual  reality you are not getting more space	3.0
That is an interesting idea isnt it Erik	You see when you are using the microscope it looks like you are getting more space but  in actuality youre not getting any more It just looks like it but you are not	3.0
What do you have to say about it	Well actually you are because the human eye cant see that but	1.0
Well actually you are because the human eye cant see that but	When you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and  the zero	1.0
When you enlarge it you can see how much space you have left between the zillionth and  the zero	Yeah but Alan what you were saying before you were saying that when you use the  microscope you get more space in that number line	1.0
Yeah but Alan what you were saying before you were saying that when you use the  microscope you get more space in that number line	That is what you were saying before	1.0
That is what you were saying before	No	1.0
No	Thats not what I was saying	1.0
Thats not what I was saying	From what I understood you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more  space on the number line	1.0
From what I understood you were saying that if you use a microscope you get more  space on the number line	It is not true	1.0
It is not true	What I mean is look if you had some really small pen if they comeup with it you could  draw a small line in the space you but you dont really know how much space you have  left between the zillionth and the zero	4.0
What I mean is look if you had some really small pen if they comeup with it you could  draw a small line in the space you but you dont really know how much space you have  left between the zillionth and the zero	You dont really know that because you cant see it  so you look at it under a microscope you could see how much space you have left	4.0
Yeah it might be Erik when you were thinking more space you were thinking of extending  it	Yeah the first time the way he said it thats why	1.0
Both of  you had a different picture in your heads about the kind of space and you were kind of  talking about the picture in your head and Alan was talking about the picture in his head  and I think Andrews picture matches Alans picture and Jessicas picture but Im not sure	Like what Im saying if you looked at it under a microscope	3.0
Like what Im saying if you looked at it under a microscope	Like the human eye	1.0
Like the human eye	Yeah like the human eye	1.0
Yeah like the human eye	and	0.0
and	You cant see it like a dust particle	1.0
You cant see it like a dust particle	Like the zillionths and trillionth	1.0
Like the zillionths and trillionth	Yeah you just have to magnify it	1.0
David	I think that you cant really see it to well but if you use a microscope then you are seeing  closer and it looks like you are seeing more but youre really not youre just looking closer  than before	4.0
I think that you cant really see it to well but if you use a microscope then you are seeing  closer and it looks like you are seeing more but youre really not youre just looking closer  than before	Yeah because there is more space even between that	1.0
Do you have an opinion	Are you a little bit lost	1.0
Okay Audra	I really do agree with them because	1.0
With whom	With Andrew and Alan because the human eye cant see it if you are making it that small  so if you put it under a microscope you really could see more	4.0
With Andrew and Alan because the human eye cant see it if you are making it that small  so if you put it under a microscope you really could see more	It would be really tiny but you could still see it	1.0
Jessica	Well I think I agree with Alan and Andrew because you really cant see if there are any  little spaces but when you put it under a microscope there might be a huge space that you  could fit a lot of spaces	4.0
Well I think I agree with Alan and Andrew because you really cant see if there are any  little spaces but when you put it under a microscope there might be a huge space that you  could fit a lot of spaces	He is not saying that it is getting bigger he is just saying that it is not going to stop	1.0
He is not saying that it is getting bigger he is just saying that it is not going to stop	Oh it is sort of like the more you see the more space you have	1.0
Oh it is sort of like the more you see the more space you have	Yeah	1.0
That is Michaels question what do you think	It is hard to explain	1.0
Mark and then well hear from Jen	I think that I agree with Alan and Andrew because they are right you cant see the thing but  if you put it under a    244  Mark microscope and if it is a really powerful one you would have a huge space there	4.0
Amy	Not sure	0.0
Okay you are not sure about that you are going to think about it some more	Okay	0.0
David	I think that you can take the little smallest thing and then put it under a microscope and  you will have a lot more space but you dont	4.0
I think that you can take the little smallest thing and then put it under a microscope and  you will have a lot more space but you dont	It looks like a lot more space but it really  isnt	4.0
It looks like a lot more space but it really  isnt	You are just magnifying it	4.0
You are just magnifying it	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So it looks like you have more space but you really dont	1.0
So it looks like you have more space but you really dont	It looks like you have more space and humans take advantage of it and take that really big  space and mark these really really little lines on it that you really just cant see on it	4.0
Alan	Up here	0.0
Up here	If like this could be the zero and this could be the size of  a bar and there could be your line	4.0
If like this could be the zero and this could be the size of  a bar and there could be your line	Now if you had the hundredths which would probably  go somewhere in here it would look say if it were right here	4.0
Now if you had the hundredths which would probably  go somewhere in here it would look say if it were right here	And then you would have all  that space in there	4.0
And then you would have all  that space in there	It looks like it but you really dont have that much space	4.0
It looks like it but you really dont have that much space	Its just that  if you had it really big that is how much space you would think you could see	4.0
So	So that means you could divide this into halves and thirds and fourths and fifths and all of that	3.0
Thats interesting	Yeah because it looks like you got a lot of space but you only really have the tincywincy  bit of space in between there	3.0
Yeah because it looks like you got a lot of space but you only really have the tincywincy  bit of space in between there	I mean you could take like a really small pen and you could  divide this up into all those pieces but if you look at it with your regular eye you couldnt  see that so you would have to make it bigger	4.0
Does that make sense	Be sure Laura understands what you are  saying	0.0
Be sure Laura understands what you are  saying	Yeah now thats their you could divide that space up into all little lines	3.0
Yeah now thats their you could divide that space up into all little lines	Now if  you magnified those spaces and here would be the little bars y you could divide this  space up into little tiny pieces and that you could divide up into little spaces	4.0
Do  you have a question for him	I dont really have a question	0.0
Comment	On my paper I had a ruler that I put up to it that I was using and I think it was millimeters or  something	4.0
On my paper I had a ruler that I put up to it that I was using and I think it was millimeters or  something	I had a ten inch number line so I just put it after one millimeter that was one  onehundredth	4.0
So that is how you placed one onehundredth	Yeah	0.0
Brian	I have a comment about what Alan and Andrew said	0.0
I have a comment about what Alan and Andrew said	You see humans dont have  powerful enough eyes to see where the zillionths are so there really is a lot of room but  you dont see it because the human eye is not as powerful as a microscope	4.0
You see humans dont have  powerful enough eyes to see where the zillionths are so there really is a lot of room but  you dont see it because the human eye is not as powerful as a microscope	Oh	0.0
Oh	I get it so there is a lot of room that you cant see	3.0
I get it so there is a lot of room that you cant see	Say in the future that you come up with this really high powered microscope you could  make that zero bar from the floor to the ceiling that would maybe let you see it being that  big	4.0
Say in the future that you come up with this really high powered microscope you could  make that zero bar from the floor to the ceiling that would maybe let you see it being that  big	You could divide it up into such small pieces that when you took off the microscope  you wouldnt see anything it would be so tiny and so small that you couldnt see it but there  really is space there and if you magnify those really tiny pieces you could divide those up  into spaces	4.0
You could divide it up into such small pieces that when you took off the microscope  you wouldnt see anything it would be so tiny and so small that you couldnt see it but there  really is space there and if you magnify those really tiny pieces you could divide those up  into spaces	Then you would probably need something with a really small point to write that small	1.0
You are so quite back there James Amy and Jakki what are you thinking  through all this discussion	It really does make sense that there is more space in between the zillionths etc	3.0
It really does make sense that there is more space in between the zillionths etc	etc	0.0
etc	So I  agree with Alan mostly	1.0
So I  agree with Alan mostly	The biggest number you could think of you could make one and so on you could go on  forever with this  I mean you could keep in magnifying it and magnifying it and  magnifying it dividing it magnifying it dividing it	4.0
The biggest number you could think of you could make one and so on you could go on  forever with this  I mean you could keep in magnifying it and magnifying it and  magnifying it dividing it magnifying it dividing it	You could take the number line that has so much little space between it and if you look at  it with a very powerful microscope then you would be able to put billions in it so it doesnt  matter how big it is it could be as small as a germ and you could still put germs in it	4.0
David	I was going to say what Brain said that it could be as big as a dust bug and just	1.0
Do you have any  editorial comments on this discussion	No	0.0
Meredith	I think what he is trying to say is that if you look at it through the microscope then there is a  lot of space but if you just look at it through the human eye then there isnt very much  space in there	4.0
Jessica	I think that well are you doing it between zero and two	3.0
I think you are doing it between zero and one	That is not half	3.0
Closer to zero or closer to one	You could use the ruler	0.0
And place let s say numbers between zero and three or negative one and two or negative two and two and see what you would come up with	Now you need to move it more over towards the one	3.0
You could do it more exact on the board	Do it in the middle	3.0
Do it in the middle	Yeah	0.0
What do you think	I don t know	2.0
How many of you like where Laura places onequarter	No	1.0
What don t you like	Is she doing it between zero and one or zero and two	1.0
Does it matter	No	0.0
No	You should put it on the half if it is going to be zero to two	4.0
You should put it on the half if it is going to be zero to two	Yeah you could divide all the zero to one into all those fractions or you could divide the zero to two into all those fractions	1.0
Can one half and one quarter go in the same spot	Where the one half is If you are going to two it can because if zero and two the half of it is one and usually the fourths are a half of a half so the half that you put there would be the fourth	4.0
Thank you very much Laura	It looks like a third	3.0
Can a fraction have more than one place	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Three quarters is on the other side of the half	3.0
But some of you seem to think it could go somewhere else and I m very confused	It could stay there or it could also go somewhere else if you double it or multiply it or	4.0
Erik	The onequarter should be moved over towards the zero more	3.0
The onequarter should be moved over towards the zero more	I know because you need to fit onethird on the other side	4.0
I know because you need to fit onethird on the other side	It looks like a third	4.0
That s the big question	There could be but you would have to add more numbers	4.0
I m talking about onequarter Meredith	There would be infinite places for onefourth because if you enlarged the space between two points you could divide that into onefourths	4.0
I m not saying divide the line	Well you could also put the one fourth on the one half and that could be	3.0
Well you could also put the one fourth on the one half and that could be	No you can t that s an improper fraction	1.0
No you can t that s an improper fraction	There are fourths for each whole	1.0
There are fourths for each whole	If you are dealing with two wholes then that would have to be eight fourths	4.0
If you are dealing with two wholes then that would have to be eight fourths	Yes there have to	1.0
Yes there have to	You can t have a one fourth for two wholes	1.0
You can t have a one fourth for two wholes	But those two wholes can make one whole	1.0
But those two wholes can make one whole	No they don t	1.0
No they don t	There are two wholes separate	1.0
There are two wholes separate	No	1.0
No	The zero to the two is what we are talking about	1.0
The zero to the two is what we are talking about	The one is what you were doing the zero to the one	1.0
The one is what you were doing the zero to the one	The one is the half for the zero and the two	1.0
The one is the half for the zero and the two	I agree with Alan because those two wholes put together make one whole so you would put the fourth on the half between the zero and the one	4.0
I agree with Alan because those two wholes put together make one whole so you would put the fourth on the half between the zero and the one	I know but Brian Brian Brian	0.0
I know but Brian Brian Brian	If you say that you are supposed to have twofourths here and twofourths there and then you divide this into two fourths	4.0
If you say that you are supposed to have twofourths here and twofourths there and then you divide this into two fourths	Then you are only going to divide this into halves	4.0
Then you are only going to divide this into halves	You are talking about having them separate but we are not we are talking about having them together	1.0
You are talking about having them separate but we are not we are talking about having them together	I know but I m saying that you think we should have fourths and they should be four forths	1.0
I know but I m saying that you think we should have fourths and they should be four forths	And you think that they are one whole together	1.0
And unless we are agreeing about the same thing then we are going to keep arguing past each other you know	Humhuh	0.0
Does it end or does it go on and on	On and on	3.0
Does it end or does it go on and on	Ends	3.0
The Cuisenaire rods that you build does it end or does it go on and on	It ends	3.0
Yes Jessica	It goes on and on if you could build a model	4.0
Is he talked about well I could say here is a half right in the middle right	Yeah	0.0
But if you look at the ruler you don t see in the middle here one half do you	No	0.0
No	You see a six	3.0
Isn t that true	Yeah	0.0
You agree to that right	Ohmhum	0.0
So maybe what helps is to think about pieces of it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Pieces	0.0
The question is where to do you fit the other fractions and how do you give them number names	Dr Maher what I think is since Alan says you should have two fourths here and two fourths here but each time you have a whole you have to have four fourths for each whole	4.0
Yeah but what I want to say to you here is that if you want to put two fourths here  Is it two fourths if you are reading your ruler	No it s one half	3.0
If you are talking the distance half way between one and two that is what you are telling me to do right	That is one and one half	3.0
That would have what number name Erik	One and one half	3.0
One and one half	It wouldn t be fourths	3.0
It wouldn t be fourths	If you put those two wholes together so then it makes one whole	4.0
We are not dealing with rods now we are dealing with the number line Brian	And if you think that two wholes have to have four fourths each you are wrong because each whole has to have four fourths to one whole	4.0
And if you think that two wholes have to have four fourths each you are wrong because each whole has to have four fourths to one whole	If you divide one whole into fourths they have to have four of them to be one whole	4.0
Now if I have to give it a number name can you give this a number name a half when it is to the right of one	No	0.0
No	You have to call is three fourths	3.0
You have to call is three fourths	You would have to call it one and one half	1.0
David	On my paper I did ohm I thought about that	0.0
On my paper I did ohm I thought about that	I put one and one half there	3.0
You put one and one half here	Yeah	0.0
Where would you put one and three quarters	You would probably push it a little to the right of one and one half	3.0
How much to the right of the one and one half would you put it	Like that much	3.0
Jessica	One and one half	3.0
One and one half	No I mean	0.0
To the right of this	Yeah it would probably go in the middle of that	3.0
Yeah it would probably go in the middle of that	Well	0.0
Why did you think middle Jessica	Because well if you had one and one fourth	4.0
One and three fourths	Yeah because well I m not sure	2.0
Something to think about Meredith	Well if you have two twofourths that would be say one and one fourth  one and one half	4.0
I m not sure I understand what you are saying	Well see if you	0.0
If you keep adding fourths you are telling me	If you have twofourths it is equal to one and one half	4.0
If you have twofourths it is equal to one and one half	So then you would have two more fourths would equal another half which would equal a whole	4.0
So you are telling me this is one and one half right	Yeah	0.0
So you are telling me that if I want another fourth what would that be	One and three fourths	3.0
You are telling me that would be one and three fourths	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah that s it	0.0
Jessica that is what you were saying	I also I think it would be a fourth because like in a half is two fourths and in that half it should take two fourths	4.0
I also I think it would be a fourth because like in a half is two fourths and in that half it should take two fourths	It does if you divide the half in half	4.0
Okay	We are calling that a half because anything past the line is one and whatever	4.0
Do you understand what I am saying	Ohmhuh	0.0
But something to think about just by the way were would two and a half be	It would be behind the two	3.0
How many of you think you know where the two and one half would be	Two and one half	3.0
Kelly	In the middle of the one and the two	3.0
In the middle of the one and the two	A little bit past the two	3.0
How much past the two	Half	3.0
Half way	Yeah	0.0
Half of what	Half of that ruler	3.0
Half of that ruler because that ruler is going to be between about what Amy	Two and three	3.0
So where would you put two and one half	Half of that ruler	3.0
Isn t that interesting	Yeah	0.0
Audra if I gave the purple the number  name one half what number name would I give to the dark  brown	One half	3.0
Audra	One half	3.0
If we gave the purple the number name one half we re going  to give the dark brown the number name one half	No I mean um the dark brown would be one	3.0
Can you tell me  how you would convince me	Because I put the purple rods up against the brown rod and I  got two purple rods	4.0
Laura	Two	3.0
You want to tell us why Laura	Because if you put	0.0
Nice and loud Laura	Because if you put one of these to	4.0
You  have to really talk loud	If you put two of these  together and each of  these was one then you one two	4.0
If you put two of these  together and each of  these was one then you one two	And that   would make that two	4.0
Jacquelyn	You name the um yellow one	3.0
Why	Because um if you take the yellow two yellows and put  them against the orange they match up	4.0
Because um if you take the yellow two yellows and put  them against the orange they match up	And if if this  is one half of it it d be well if orange is two  you would make this  into a one	4.0
I want you to do both problems	You can call it one fourth  Brian C  One fourth	3.0
You can call it one fourth  Brian C  One fourth	One fourth	3.0
One fourth	This is two and this is this	3.0
Let s see if you fall into the trap	is one	3.0
is one	This is one fourth one fourth and this is one half	3.0
This is one fourth one fourth and this is one half	One fourth one half	3.0
One fourth one half	Brian C One fourth and one half	3.0
Brian C One fourth and one half	Jacquelyn This is one whole and this is two	3.0
Alan	Ok We made a train and if this was considered two what  would the red one be the red rod be	0.0
Boy that s some problem	And the other one was if this  was considered one  what would the little red rod be	0.0
Okay so if it was one you said you d call it one fourth and if  it was two what did you say	It would be one and one fourth	3.0
How many of you agree that if we call the yellow and the  green one two	Two it would be	3.0
If you call the yellow and green together  one what did you call the red rod	One fourth	3.0
Because if you don t agree with the arguments that  Audra and Sarah are going to give you you have to come up  with a different argument	Well because see the yellow and the green was the same  size as the brown so if we put the reds up against the no  wait no	4.0
Well because see the yellow and the green was the same  size as the brown so if we put the reds up against the no  wait no	See because there s if there was one we would if  it was brown we would normally call it one	4.0
See because there s if there was one we would if  it was brown we would normally call it one	And if we put  the reds up against it we would all call it one fourth so we  thought if we called the yellow and the green one it would  be the same thing as the brown	4.0
Erik	I agree	1.0
You agree	Yeah because see if the brown and the yellow and green  theyre equal and theyre both  called one and four of the reds  equal up to one therefore that they d have to be fourths  because there are four parts theyre fourths	4.0
Brian	We disagree	1.0
Nice and loud Brian	We thought the um the two we called that one half	3.0
You agree that when we call  it one that this is a fourth	Yes	0.0
You re not sure you have an  argument	No	0.0
I like to hear your argument and see if you convince  Sarah and Audra who want to be convinced	Well we thought the two  would be called a half	3.0
The two what Brian	The two would be a half	3.0
The two of what	When this  is two these  would be  called a half	4.0
You re saying a red would become a half	Yeah	0.0
Can you convince us	Not really	0.0
Brian	Jackie thought of the two	1.0
So she should be able to explain  it	Well this was called two  and this would be called  all of these would be called one half	4.0
Well this was called two  and this would be called  all of these would be called one half	Because  uh um	4.0
You don t remember how you did that	Yeah I forgot	0.0
Because you also called it one half  didnt you you and Meredith	Um yeah and um so if this is called two  and then this would be two too	4.0
Um yeah and um so if this is called two  and then this would be two too	So then this would be one  and this would be one	4.0
Michael did you follow it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	All right so	0.0
It might help other people  follow it so let s give David another chance and then maybe  Michael can help him out and Meredith	Alright so if this is two   then this would be a half because if you put another one and  another one that d be two	4.0
Is that what you were thinking Jackie	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I just couldn t it out	0.0
You want to try it again now that  David helped you the way he was thinking	No	0.0
Go ahead Brian	Well	0.0
If you think  you understand it maybe that might help some people	If you take these two  that would be one half	4.0
And this would be another one half	These would be one	3.0
These would be one	These are ones	1.0
These are ones	And then if you take one away then this  would be a half	4.0
And is it okay to  do it this time	No	0.0
Jakki want to talk about that a little  bit	Well if this if well it s because of this one because it s two	4.0
Well if this if well it s because of this one because it s two	If we call this both of these one half it  would be one	4.0
Oh so you re saying its okay to call it one half if we call this  one	Yeah	0.0
Erik	I think the confusion is they think that they just they think  they have the temptation of calling since there are four red  blocks they think they re gonna call it one fourth  cause they  forget that the yellow and the green are two	4.0
What are they thinking that the yellow and the green are  when they do that	One	1.0
They are thinking that the yellow and the green are one when  they do that	Because see if you have one there d be two halves but if  you have two its two halves plus two halves which would be  four halves	4.0
Because see if you have one there d be two halves but if  you have two its two halves plus two halves which would be  four halves	So you d have therefore youd have to call one  of the reds one half	4.0
Meredith doesn t think so and Mark what do you think	You probably gave Tom the uh bigger a bigger half than  Amy	3.0
And does that make sense to give a bigger half	Mm hmm	0.0
How	Well say you gave this was one  and then you gave this much to Tom  and this much to Amy	4.0
Well say you gave this was one  and then you gave this much to Tom  and this much to Amy	That  wouldn t be a fair cut	4.0
David	No because it wasn t even	4.0
What do you mean by that David	Well um the half should be even so that the other side is the  same as it is	4.0
Well um the half should be even so that the other side is the  same as it is	So the yellow is bigger than the green and the  half should be the same size	4.0
Brian	Two purple would make a half	3.0
Each of those would be one half	Yeah	0.0
Audra what do you think	Because see you had the red	4.0
Because see you had the red	Well if the candy bar was  this size  and you  were to divide it in half and then Amy probably got a piece  like this  and	4.0
You wouldn t  pull that on a younger brother or sister would you	Yes	0.0
What do you think Caitlin	Cause they re weren t the same size chocolate bar	4.0
Brian	We re working with halves	3.0
Audra	Because see since we re working with halves you took these  two together   and you called it called it two and it would be like one candy  bar and the other candy bar	4.0
Because see since we re working with halves you took these  two together   and you called it called it two and it would be like one candy  bar and the other candy bar	And if you put the reds on top  um I think someone they said that if it was a half if you put  two reds on top of the green and it isn t  cause the two reds is  bigger than one green than one light green and it can t be  half	4.0
And if you put the reds on top  um I think someone they said that if it was a half if you put  two reds on top of the green and it isn t  cause the two reds is  bigger than one green than one light green and it can t be  half	Just like the chocolate bar couldn t be a half	4.0
How  do you imagine a half of a candy bar Jackie	Cut it right down the middle	3.0
Why not  Graham	Cause there s three of them	4.0
Cause there s three of them	And you would need to have four so I could cut it in half	3.0
How  many	Six	3.0
Gregory nice and loud so everyone can hear you back there	Well Danielle will have one row and Dr Landis will have  one row then I would have one row	3.0
And how many wedges would that be for you	Um four	3.0
So when you got half Jackie said  you got six out of twelve  and  when we got a third you got how many out of twelve	Um four	3.0
What do you think Amy	The person who got a half	3.0
Andrew	I would want the third	3.0
Of the big one	Yeah	0.0
Michael	Because you uh you were gonna split up a big one so but  then she ran back and got the little one and split that in half  and gave that half to him and then she took the big one and  got a third of it and ate that piece	4.0
David	The guy with one third	3.0
Meredith	Which one s bigger	3.0
Which	Which thing is bigger	3.0
Is that really fair	No	0.0
Michael	Well normally half is bigger than one third but if you got a  bigger piece of a candy bar or pizza you got a big pizza and  you get and you get half or one third of that then that ll be  more than just a little pizza that you get half of	4.0
Which is bigger one half or one third	Let s see	0.0
You want to put these in the middle Erik so that you and  Alan can share them	One third and one half	3.0
One third and one half	One third	1.0

The blue can be divided into  thirds	You think I care	0.0
You think I care	You don t need that	1.0
You don t need that	See Alan you messed it all up	0.0
As I walk around and  I watch what youre doing are we allowed to switch candy  bars	No	0.0
Are we allowed if were making a half and third are we  allowed to have different size candy bars	No	0.0
Remember thats the rule from now on in mathematics	Get the model of a half	3.0

No	So do I	0.0
So do I	Unfair info this is no model of a half	3.0

A half would be bigger nevertheless	There s no half of a blue then why did you pick the blue	2.0
There s no half of a blue then why did you pick the blue	And give this back  you  don t need it	3.0
And give this back  you  don t need it	There s nothing else that can be divided into thirds and  halves	3.0
There s nothing else that can be divided into thirds and  halves	Yeah I m sure there isn t	1.0
Yeah I m sure there isn t	You d have to make your own rod for each one  em	3.0

Meredith Let s do the model that I did before	Remember	0.0
Remember	That s nine remember	3.0
That s nine remember	You can only make it  with the even bars	3.0
You can only make it  with the even bars	Now lets get three of these and  make a half out of that if we can	0.0
Now lets get three of these and  make a half out of that if we can	Wait let me do the red ones	0.0
Wait let me do the red ones	And you take two light greens and that would be equal and  they d be equal	4.0
And you take two light greens and that would be equal and  they d be equal	And if you take the purple and the dark  greens and you made the purple a third and then the greens a  half then they d be equal	4.0
And if you take the purple and the dark  greens and you made the purple a third and then the greens a  half then they d be equal	Thats what youre gonna tell the class	0.0
Thats what youre gonna tell the class	We can raise  our hands	0.0
We can raise  our hands	Wait lets in the meantime let me try to figure out another  way	0.0
Wait lets in the meantime let me try to figure out another  way	How about three of these	2.0
How about three of these	I dont think  theres any other ways	4.0
I dont think  theres any other ways	Only three reds and two light green and three purples two  dark greens	4.0
Only three reds and two light green and three purples two  dark greens	How many ways can you get	2.0
How many ways can you get	Its not equal	3.0
Its not equal	Oh	0.0
Oh	Whats smaller than this	2.0
Whats smaller than this	Dark green	3.0
Dark green	Ok What s	0.0
Ok What s	And smaller than that	2.0
And smaller than that	Yellow	3.0
Yellow	Im trying yellow	0.0
Im trying yellow	What  half of an orange	2.0
What  half of an orange	This	3.0
This	Whats third of an orange	2.0
Whats third of an orange	Oh do you have  one more purple	0.0
Oh do you have  one more purple	No that wouldn t work either	3.0
What do you have here	We found out if you take two dark greens and you make each  one a half and you make these a third they d be  equal	4.0
So which is bigger	They re equal in these colors	3.0
What number name is this	A half	3.0
What number name is this	One third	3.0
One third	A third	1.0
Which is bigger a half or a third	The half	3.0
The half is bigger	Oh yeah	0.0
Right by how much	By an inch	3.0
By an inch	No by a	0.0
And what number name would you give the red  then	A quarter	3.0
Remember what you called one	A quarter	3.0
Sure it s a quarter	Oh	0.0
Change your mind	Yeah	0.0
Okay can you explain that	Maybe	0.0
Maybe	Not real	0.0
Not real	Okay so what  would these be	2.0
Okay so what  would these be	They re  six	3.0
They re  six	One fourth	1.0
One fourth	And one half	3.0
And one half	A half plus a fourth	3.0
A half plus a fourth	Oh God	0.0
Oh God	Wouldn t they be one third	3.0
Wouldn t they be one third	A third	1.0
A third	No	3.0
No	What would we call that	2.0
What would we call that	Two of these white ones	2.0
Ok uh I know were not going to have enough time to hear  from all these wonderful solutions Im seeing but Im hoping  that on Monday if you dont forgotten what youve done you  can start thinking about it and Dr Landis said she may stop  by here on Monday and Dr Martino will be here and we  hope youll share your solutions and write about it but lets  hear a real quick one from from Laura and from Jessica	Well this this here would be  one third the pink would be one third	3.0
Well this this here would be  one third the pink would be one third	And one half would  be the green the dark green	3.0
So which is bigger	The one half	3.0
So the  next question how much bigger	It s the size  of the red	3.0
Alan	One sixth	3.0
Why do you think so Alan	Because we know already that that three reds would make a  dark green and if there are two dark greens to make the  orange and the and the red rod then it would take six red  rods to make the orange and the red rod	4.0
I want to thank you for a fun week and I hope you have a  great weekend	So when I take off these I think that itll fall over here	4.0
So when I take off these I think that itll fall over here	And  the green is the whole thing and the light green is a half and  the reds are a third	4.0
Because Dr Martino didn t see  this and I think she ll want to see it	Well she s making something else and I m making I made  the balance	1.0
Well she s making something else and I m making I made  the balance	She s making another	1.0
Dr Martino if we can get her here	All right I made a balance and the whole thing is dark green  and the light green is a half and the reds are the thirds but  then what I m doing is um I m making a balance so when I  take off that and those two reds then I  think it will fall to this side and show that the half is bigger	4.0
All right I made a balance and the whole thing is dark green  and the light green is a half and the reds are the thirds but  then what I m doing is um I m making a balance so when I  take off that and those two reds then I  think it will fall to this side and show that the half is bigger	When he removes the one light green rod  and the two red   leaving one light green rod and one  red rod his structure falls to the side of the light  green rod	0.0
What  did you take off	I took off the two reds and a light green	3.0
It it you  said it fell to the right the way you had it built okay	Um	0.0
Is that correct and the  greens were on the other side or was it the other way	Well the reds were on the left side	3.0
So you took the two reds from the left side  and the green from the right	Mmmm hmm	0.0
Do you understand my question	Um let s see	0.0
What would you have guessed it should have been	Um maybe a little white  these	3.0
Why  were you looking for that one	Well  cause when I went like this I just saw there was one space in between and I  knew the white is that space	4.0
That s  the next question	Um	0.0
Michael	Um if you know what youre doing and you know what strategy  you could probably build you could probably build one for every  single rod	3.0
What do you mean one for every single rod tell me what you  mean by that	You could you could build a thing you could build fractions of  every single rod if you know what youre doing and you have a  strategy or a secret that that you know will work	3.0
What can be such a secret	Thats what I was trying to figure out	0.0
How  many do you think	Well we got six	3.0
You think thats it	No	1.0
What do you think	Well maybe if you say you had a white rod and you divided the  white rod maybe you could make more models that way if you  divided the white rods	4.0
So youre thinking if you had more different size rods	Yeah yeah	0.0
Graham you can come and help	I dont have fourths in my one that I made	3.0
Ok you want to tell the class about  what you have there	Ok um well um we had this model and we uh this is two thirds  and three fourths and we think that three fourths is bigger by one  twelfth	4.0
Whats one twelfth	Because um twelve whites equal up to this	4.0
Because um twelve whites equal up to this	Let me show here	0.0
Are you all convinced	But didnt you say to make a smaller one	0.0
Well I said you make the smallest one you can make	But I dont think thats the smallest one	3.0
What do you think	Well we just put twelve whites on there and it  takes one white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple  to the three greens	4.0
Well we just put twelve whites on there and it  takes one white to equal the two pinks to the three oh yeah purple  to the three greens	So thats why we think its one twelfth	4.0
What do you think Erik	Smaller in sizewise	4.0
Smaller in sizewise	Like size for the thirds the fourths and and  the whole	4.0
Like size for the thirds the fourths and and  the whole	Smaller by size	4.0
Brian	Well um the orange and the red	3.0
Ok	We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller one  because every one you use equals up to an orange and a red and  the secret is that every one has three purples and four greens	4.0
We say that there was no more that you cant get a smaller one  because every one you use equals up to an orange and a red and  the secret is that every one has three purples and four greens	And  so you cant possibly make one smaller because you wont be able  to fit it wont work because every one you make equals up equals  up to the orange and red	4.0
So youre telling me the six models that you made	Were the same length	3.0
Thats very  interesting	Well well we could make another model to show that	0.0
You found  different ways to show one that had the same length as orange and  red	Yeah Sarah just built another model that uses the exact same  length as the other one	1.0
And what did what was how did she make her train	Yeah thats what I was going to do	1.0
Yeah thats what I was going to do	Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the third is  purple and the fourths were the dark greens were the light greens	4.0
Blue light green and then the half is dark green and the third is  purple and the fourths were the dark greens were the light greens	See thats what I did I was gonna make one that was the same  exact size	1.0
How would  you convince me	Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the part that  theres no theres no other smaller	4.0
Well see I agree that that I agree with them just at the part that  theres no theres no other smaller	I think because at their model  they use the twelfth as the white ones and theres no rod smaller  than the white rod	4.0
I think because at their model  they use the twelfth as the white ones and theres no rod smaller  than the white rod	So therefore if you make it a rod smaller than  it they cant you cant divide it into twelfths	4.0
Yeah	Because the twelfths right here are the smallest rod possible	4.0
Ok so	Unless you made a new rod	3.0
So unless we use Merediths idea of creating new rods that had  that were smaller than the white rods then you could make a  smaller model Erik	Yeah	0.0
Are there others	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I know I just did one	0.0
You have another one	Yeah	0.0
I would like one that uh is the next smallest	Next sma	0.0
Brian whats your prediction	I think it would be twentyfour	3.0
What rods	Well the next the next the next larger one will be I think the  whole will be twentyfour	3.0
But we we call the whole one	Yeah I know but what I mean	0.0
Yeah I know but what I mean	No no it would take twenty four ones to equal a whole	1.0
What would be what would be twentyfourths	Like the there would be there would take twentyfour white cubes  to equal up to a whole	4.0
Like the there would be there would take twentyfour white cubes  to equal up to a whole	I I also have a strategy	0.0
Wait wait a second youre saying twentyfour white ones would  equal your train	Yeah yeah	0.0
So then what would one white one  be called in that next model do you think	One twelfth	3.0
One twelfth	I think um	0.0
What would that white one be called	Well its not gonna were not gonna	0.0
Well its not gonna were not gonna	Let me see this	0.0
Let me see this	Um one twentyfourth I think	3.0
You think that too	Yeah Alan and I made that same model	4.0
Yeah Alan and I made that same model	We made the same model  that was I think it was two oranges and like one purple yeah it was  two oranges and one purple and then it had the thirds	4.0
Is that what you  had	I made that also	1.0
Ok can you leave the other one up there maybe  while youre making that	Sure we can	0.0
James why dont you make the other one too so it doesnt go away  on the bottom	Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	0.0
Kaitlin can I borrow some oranges	2  more no  6 more	3.0
I would suggest  you to make both models in your seats and keep them in front of  you	Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twentyfour  twentyfour here	4.0
Wait no twelve plus two wait twelve plus twelve twentyfour  twentyfour here	Youve got twentyfour plus twentyfour is forty eight	4.0
Youve got twentyfour plus twentyfour is forty eight	I need those	0.0
I need those	I need another red	0.0
I need another red	I need thirtysix whites	0.0
I need thirtysix whites	Thirtysix	1.0
Thirtysix	Why	2.0
Why	Why	2.0
Why	Why are you saying thirtysix	2.0
Why are you saying thirtysix	I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	0.0
I need the reds Im trying to prove a point here	You can have all the reds you want	0.0
You can have all the reds you want	Im going to sit here and watch  you guys	0.0
Im going to sit here and watch  you guys	Were in battle	0.0
I see that you built a model that has two oranges and a  purple that youre calling one	Well I imagine the white ones	0.0
And youre imagining the whites and how many do you imagine  are there	Twentyfour	3.0
And  how many do you have there Andrew	Um twentyfour whites	3.0
But you built it too Amy how many  do you have Amy	Twentyfour	3.0
Yes	Twentyfour	3.0
Because  if youre not you may want to go up and count them to be sure or  go to someone else who built the model and count them	I I built the model	0.0
Ok so Sarah  and Beth you built one you dont have enough	No	0.0
Ok do you believe there are  Sarah and  Beth	Yeah	0.0
That hes now going to give the white one the number name what  class	One twentyfourth	3.0
We know  the white one has number name one twentyfourth in that model	Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the thirds	3.0
Uh see what we did here was we have the fourths and the thirds	Yes mmm hmmm	1.0
Yes mmm hmmm	And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths would  do it	1.0
And then the twelfths and they they said that the twelfths would  do it	mmm hmmm	1.0
mmm hmmm	So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is two  whites and then people think the twelfths would be the answer but  if you take two of the twentyfourths	4.0
So the twelfths would be the reds which is one which is two  whites and then people think the twelfths would be the answer but  if you take two of the twentyfourths	It would equal up to a red rod	1.0
It would equal up to a red rod	It would equal up to a red rod	1.0
It would equal up to a red rod	Which would be equal to twelfths	1.0
Which would be equal to twelfths	Which would be one twelfth	1.0
Which would be one twelfth	So see we think I think that the  answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	3.0
So see we think I think that the  answer is either two twentyfourths or one twelfth	Mmm hmmm	1.0
How many of you agree with what they said	So there are two answers	3.0
So there are two answers	Both the same	3.0
Ok Lets listen to Davids theory and see if we could  convince those or else they have to show us our theory doesnt  work	Well first um Meredith made um a model which had one  orange one blue and one black	1.0
Thats  what you told me	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	1.0
And then she had um the whites I think they were  something like	Twentyfourths	1.0
Twentyfourths	Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and um	1.0
Yeah one twentyfourth and the reds were one twelfth and um	Just like the one up there	3.0
Just like the one up there	Yeah	1.0
So youre saying that if I had an orange a blue and a black that the  model should look like the one up here	Just about	3.0
But it doesnt	well	0.0
See what happens	But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	0.0
But then then the one then the the uh um I dont know	Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	3.0
Then the reds couldnt be twelfths	Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites couldnt be  twentyfourths	1.0
Yeah then the reds couldnt be twelfths and the whites couldnt be  twentyfourths	Right it would either take one	1.0
Andrew and Jessica what do you  think	Well I made a model  that had the white was one fortyeighth and the purples were  twelfths and the white was I mean the red was twentyfourths and I  took two browns as the thirds and two dark greens as the fourths  and they I called them the fourths and then the whole was four  oranges and two purples	4.0
Now youre telling me that you used browns two browns to be	One like one one third	3.0
One like one one third	Yeah	3.0
One brown was one third two browns was two thirds	No	0.0
Is that what youre telling me	No	0.0
No	Two browns was one third	3.0
Two browns was one third	Two browns was one third	1.0
Two browns was one third	I took two browns and put them together	3.0
Two browns to be one third	Yeah	0.0
Ok lets  see what theyre doing here because um it looks to me as if you  need a bunch of rods to do this	It might not be enough	3.0
I think can you see Alan and Erik	Not really	0.0
So some of you may have to go up in a minute to see  what theyre doing	Well what we did was we made a model and we counted um	3.0
Well what we did was we made a model and we counted um	Four oranges	1.0
Four oranges	four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our thirds we  counted we counted two oranges as one I mean two browns as  one	4.0
four oranges and two purples as our whole and for our thirds we  counted we counted two oranges as one I mean two browns as  one	And we had	0.0
And we had	that was our third	3.0
that was our third	That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two greens as  one  two dark greens as  one	3.0
That was our thirds and for our fourths we counted two greens as  one  two dark greens as  one	Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were fortyeights	3.0
Purples were our twelfths the reds were the twentyfourths   and the whites were fortyeights	Fortyeighths	1.0
Fortyeighths	And we think that we think that three um fourths  are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I mean four  fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	4.0
And we think that we think that three um fourths  are bigger than two thirds by either um one forty I mean four  fortyeighths um two twelfths or um	No two twentyfourths	1.0
No two twentyfourths	Two twentyfourth or whats that	2.0
Two twentyfourth or whats that	One twelfth	3.0
What do you think about that Michael	I guess I agree with it its what I came up with	1.0
You came up with the same model didnt you	Yeah	0.0
Meredith and David  and Erik and Alan  does this model have anything to do with the  theory you tested David	Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one forty eighth	4.0
Uh yes because we thought that the ones would be one forty eighth	And and the	0.0
And and the	And then the reds would be um one	3.0
And then the reds would be um one	Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought that the  light greens would be well David thought that the light greens  would be twelfths but then we tried it and they would become the  sixteenths so then we tried the purple yeah the sixteenths and we  tried the purple and then that was the twelfths	4.0
Twentyfourth and the purple well originally we thought that the  light greens would be well David thought that the light greens  would be twelfths but then we tried it and they would become the  sixteenths so then we tried the purple yeah the sixteenths and we  tried the purple and then that was the twelfths	Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	4.0
Since whites are doubles theyre fortyeighths	So in other words we doubled everything	1.0
So in other words we doubled everything	Yeah	4.0
Yeah	You basically just added like there originally were just two  oranges now there are four oranges and an extra purple	4.0
You basically just added like there originally were just two  oranges now there are four oranges and an extra purple	Now there  are six there are six browns	4.0
All of these  represent one is that a surprise	It could have been two purples changing into a brown	3.0
It could have been two purples changing into a brown	Yeah	0.0
Thats true	And	0.0
You see this one here you  called the orange and red one isnt that right and here you called  one two orange and purple right	So basically its just doubled	3.0
So basically its just doubled	Thats	0.0
In what way is it doubled	Um ok its doubled because it now it has four oranges and two  purples or a brown so	4.0
But the first one doesnt have any purples	Well thats because this had nothing to do with the first problem  because of the first question but	4.0
Im not sure I understand what youre saying	Had there have been sixths	3.0
Had there have been sixths	I know	0.0
We didnt have sixths we had twelfths here	Mmm hmm	0.0
Mmm hmm	I think I know what hes saying	1.0
I think I know what hes saying	Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are forty eighths this time	4.0
Right there you have twentyfourths and the whites are forty eighths this time	Now up there there are no purples because they  werent put on	4.0
Now up there there are no purples because they  werent put on	But had they have been on the bottom which they  are they are twelfths because	4.0
But had they have been on the bottom which they  are they are twelfths because	Purples	1.0
Purples	In that	0.0
In that	Purples are twelfths	3.0
Purples are twelfths	In that model they became twelfths but over there they would be  the sixths	4.0
In that model they became twelfths but over there they would be  the sixths	Like Amy said if	1.0
Like Amy said if	Right because if you double each of them it would come out to  twice the number	4.0
Right because if you double each of them it would come out to  twice the number	Exactly	1.0
James	Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and two  purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the reds there  its two reds make a purple and that that means the two oranges  and the red make two oranges and a purple	4.0
Uh I think um that um because there are two oranges and two  purples I agree with Alan that its double but why the reds there  its two reds make a purple and that that means the two oranges  and the red make two oranges and a purple	Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model and a  purple and then two more oranges and a purple and you put them  on top of each other theyd be equal	4.0
Yeah cuz if you took the two oranges out of that model and a  purple and then two more oranges and a purple and you put them  on top of each other theyd be equal	But if you put em side to side  youd have four oranges and two purples or the two purples could  be a brown	4.0
But if you put em side to side  youd have four oranges and two purples or the two purples could  be a brown	So its basically doubled each of the length is doubled	4.0
But how did the red get  doubled	The red	3.0
Im confused how did the red get doubled here	The red	3.0
Kimberly	Well they used a purple and the red two reds make a purple so  now if they have a purple they doubled the red	4.0
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I was going to say something different	1.0
Danielle	Um four oranges and two purples	3.0
Do we have four oranges and two purples	One two three four yup or four oranges and one brown	3.0
Or four oranges and one brown	Yep	0.0
If I were to make another model  Andrews hand is up Andrew knows my question what do you  think my question is Andrew	If you were gonna make another model what um the doubles be	3.0
Brian	Um fortyeight	3.0
Imagine in your head what I would call  one	Fortyeight	4.0
Fortyeight	Cuz there would be well cuz there would be forty eight whites equal up to one and then	4.0
Well we have fortyeight whites going up to one here dont we	Oh	0.0
In this model	So we have to double that	3.0
So we have to double that	But no	1.0
I dont know Im asking you thats my question Andrew what do  you think	Well youre saying what	0.0
Well youre saying what	No it cant	3.0
No it cant	Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	3.0
Well the whole would be eight orange rods and	It cant be done	1.0
Eight orange rods Im listening	Eight orange rods and two browns	3.0
Eight orange rods and two browns	And two browns	1.0
And two brown rods	You cant double that	4.0
You cant double that	You cant double that model because if you  did then you wouldnt be able to third it	4.0
You cant double that model because if you  did then you wouldnt be able to third it	You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you just train  it	1.0
You wanna make a bet  all you had to do is train it  you just train  it	Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges and  two browns now is there any rod that could third that	2.0
Right because if you doubled that it would be eight oranges and  two browns now is there any rod that could third that	Well if you use a train	1.0
Well if you use a train	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	1.0
If you use a train just like in Andrews theory	Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	4.0
Well if you train the rod but that would make it not equal	It would probably be	0.0
It would probably be	Up there its just plain except for the whole	3.0
Up there its just plain except for the whole	It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and three  dark greens would be the fourths	3.0
It would probably be three browns would be the thirds and three  dark greens would be the fourths	Right but that would be using more than one rod to make another  rod to fit fit the same thing	1.0
Right but that would be using more than one rod to make another  rod to fit fit the same thing	Yeah so you can do that	1.0
Yeah so you can do that	Just like you Andrew said you can use  a train to make a third and a fourth	4.0
Just like you Andrew said you can use  a train to make a third and a fourth	Cuz he like I I overheard  they said that if you can use a train to make a whole why cant you  use it to make a third and a fourth	4.0
Cuz he like I I overheard  they said that if you can use a train to make a whole why cant you  use it to make a third and a fourth	Yeah	1.0
David	And a half	3.0
And a half	But then it wouldnt be equal	1.0
But then it wouldnt be equal	Yeah they would	4.0
Yeah they would	Cuz the third could be like in that model  Andrew used the two browns thats equal	4.0
Cuz the third could be like in that model  Andrew used the two browns thats equal	But in that model the three browns dont have anything attached  on so its totally equal	4.0
But in that model the three browns dont have anything attached  on so its totally equal	So	2.0
So	They just doubled it	1.0
They just doubled it	But if you added something on	1.0
But if you added something on	We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that model	3.0
We just doubled we doubled that model to equal that model	Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	3.0
Yeah and I doubled the brown  two browns	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	So in the next model	0.0
Did you want to say something	Um I agree with Erik	1.0
What part of what Erik said	Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like Erik said  that you can train it and put the other blocks onto the other one	1.0
Well Alan didnt think that you could uh third it but like Erik said  that you can train it and put the other blocks onto the other one	What I meant what I meant is you cant third it just using one rod	3.0
Ok Alan	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	You cant third it using one rod but you can third it using  trains	4.0
Ok so	You could double that but you would have to use two rods to  make it	4.0
Ok so you think you can double it and you think you can imagine   can you make one bigger than that	If you doubled that it would be sixteen oranges  and  sixteen oranges and four browns	4.0
Ok the question I want to leave you all to think about Id like you  to uh first Id like to thank you for the wonderful models you built  but the question Id like you to think about is uh is there is there a  biggest model	Thirtytwo oranges	3.0
And if you dont have enough uh rods  you could imagine we could write to Cuisenaire and we can have  them ship us buckets and buckets and buckets and buckets	Or we could combine all our stuff	0.0
Or we could combine all our stuff	We could start by that but my question to all of you is there a  biggest model	0.0
We could start by that but my question to all of you is there a  biggest model	Why or why not	0.0
Why or why not	And Id like you to write to me  about about that	0.0
And Id like you to write to me  about about that	Would you do that	0.0
Would you do that	Would you write to me	0.0
Would you write to me	Maybe Mrs Phillips can let you combine and build together that  might take a little while	0.0
Maybe Mrs Phillips can let you combine and build together that  might take a little while	So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	4.0
So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	4.0
Neat ok	And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red	4.0
Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length	Im working on that one down here	0.0
Youre working on that one it looks like youre working on a  bigger model here	Mmm hmm	0.0
Does that one work	Yup	0.0
Tell me about that one	Ok the two oranges make the whole	3.0
Ok	And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	4.0
And these the five purples are the fifths and the two oranges again  are just the halves now down here the reds are the tenths	And  again if you remove that  it would take  one of those  to fill in the gap so its bigger by one half is  bigger than two fifths by one tenth	4.0
You seemed to come up with that pretty  quickly	Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	4.0
Because up here I knew that this was ten and two tens would be  twenty and I knew that that would work so it takes two of those to  complete it using a double ten	So one of those  filled in  the gap	4.0
So one of those  filled in  the gap	Probably if you used another one  another two you could fill in that with more  purples and using more reds too	4.0
Interesting	And it could make more	3.0
Thats an interesting theory could you kind of test that  one out for me and see see if you could build a bigger model	Im trying to build a bigger model	0.0
If you need more stuff Ive got more rods	I can use from these models	3.0
Ive also got more rods up there	So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	4.0
So um if you took out two of those  that would be  two fifths and that would be a half	And one of those  would fill in the gap  so it would be one tenth so it  would be a half is bigger than two fifths by one tenth	4.0
Neat ok	And then down here its basically the same size as the orange I just  made a train of a brown and a red	4.0
Ok do you think now that you can I mean youre working on this  one I can see do you think you can come up with one thats a  different total length than ones thats different from these two  these two have the same length	Im working on that one down here	0.0
Youre working on that one it looks like youre working on a  bigger model here	Mmm hmm	0.0

Hows this big model coming	Not too good	0.0
Not too good	Not too good	0.0
Not too good	We had it we had it better yesterday	0.0
What happened	It was fine yesterday but now it doesnt work	3.0
It was fine yesterday but now it doesnt work	Oh I see what s wrong	0.0
What do you thinks messing things up	It needs a one	3.0
It needs a one	But cant we cant we cant we trade in one of the blacks for a  brown	1.0
But cant we cant we cant we trade in one of the blacks for a  brown	But then that wouldnt fit	1.0
But then that wouldnt fit	Yeah it would	1.0
Yeah it would	It would mess everything up though Erik	1.0
It would mess everything up though Erik	The purples wouldn t fit  the greens wouldnt fit the whites would fit but maybe not the  reds	4.0
The purples wouldn t fit  the greens wouldnt fit the whites would fit but maybe not the  reds	No if we trade it for a no lets trade it for a blue	3.0
Oh I see youre calling I see youre calling one of those that top  train with the oranges and the blues and the blacks	Because then if you put another green here	3.0
Because then if you put another green here	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	But    Erika and David What about the purple	2.0
But    Erika and David What about the purple	Just take the purples out you dont need the purple	1.0
Just take the purples out you dont need the purple	Well then thats going to mess everything up Meredith	1.0
Well then thats going to mess everything up Meredith	Then what will be the twelfths	2.0
Then what will be the twelfths	No yeah then what would be the  twelfths	2.0
No yeah then what would be the  twelfths	We dont need the twelfths	3.0
We dont need the twelfths	Yeah we do	1.0
Yeah we do	Because thats the whole thing	4.0
Because thats the whole thing	Thats the whole question	1.0
Thats the whole question	Thats the whole answer	3.0
Thats the whole answer	Its either three  twenty	3.0
Its either three  twenty	Well wheres the two thirds	3.0
Well wheres the two thirds	Well we dont really know	0.0
Well we dont really know	But the question is which is bigger two thirds or three  fourths	0.0
But the question is which is bigger two thirds or three  fourths	Well Erik um remember fourths if green was one twelfth then  that would be it but like I said before that I thought that well we  dont really need the greens	4.0
Well Erik um remember fourths if green was one twelfth then  that would be it but like I said before that I thought that well we  dont really need the greens	Wait wait wait wait wait	0.0
Wait wait wait wait wait	This isnt the model we did before	4.0
This isnt the model we did before	The  model we did before I believe was three oranges and like  something else	4.0
The  model we did before I believe was three oranges and like  something else	No it wasnt cause I remember your original model was an orange  a blue and a black and then I thought if we doubled it	4.0
No it wasnt cause I remember your original model was an orange  a blue and a black and then I thought if we doubled it	What if we did just an two oranges two blues one black and one  blue	4.0
What if we did just an two oranges two blues one black and one  blue	That ones not totally messing it up	4.0
That ones not totally messing it up	Except the purples	1.0
Except the purples	Purple we could figure out	1.0
Purple we could figure out	Wait	0.0
Wait	Wait	0.0
Wait	Ive an idea	0.0
Ive an idea	Take away this put on this	3.0
Take away this put on this	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	And then put a one there	3.0
And then put a one there	Then you could put one here it would fit  better	3.0
Then you could put one here it would fit  better	Then put a red	1.0
Then put a red	Do you really need the green	1.0
Do you really need the green	No not really	3.0
No not really	So should we just take it out	0.0
So should we just take it out	Yeah cuz I mean its giving us too big of a problem and we dont  need it	4.0
Yeah cuz I mean its giving us too big of a problem and we dont  need it	I dont know why we put it on	0.0
I dont know why we put it on	I just did that because I thought the green ones were the twelfths	4.0
I just did that because I thought the green ones were the twelfths	Yeah I know	1.0
Yeah I know	This is a oh lets measure it	3.0
This is a oh lets measure it	It is approximately  fiftythree	3.0
It is approximately  fiftythree	No its fiftytwo	3.0
No its fiftytwo	No its fiftytwo and a half	3.0
No its fiftytwo and a half	No it isnt	1.0
No it isnt	Watch	0.0
Watch	It needs to be equal	3.0
It needs to be equal	Erik it starts like that	1.0
Erik it starts like that	No it doesnt start at one it starts at zero	1.0
No it doesnt start at one it starts at zero	Yes	0.0
Yes	Another one another one another one another one	3.0
Tell me  about this model and tell me just what you told me before	Ok originally I had two oranges and that was that would only use  twenty of the whites but if you added another two of them on it  would be forty of the whites	4.0
Ok originally I had two oranges and that was that would only use  twenty of the whites but if you added another two of them on it  would be forty of the whites	So the whites down here are the  fortieths	4.0
So the whites down here are the  fortieths	And the purples would take five to use  for the two and  another five over here so that would be the tenths	4.0
And the purples would take five to use  for the two and  another five over here so that would be the tenths	And now these  if you put two oranges together the two oranges each would be the  halves	4.0
And now these  if you put two oranges together the two oranges each would be the  halves	These would be the twentieths  and the browns would  be the fifths	4.0
These would be the twentieths  and the browns would  be the fifths	Now there should be I think nineteen more on here to  complete the fortieths	4.0
Now there should be I think nineteen more on here to  complete the fortieths	You cant make the model any bigger than  this You would have to use one blue	4.0
You cant make the model any bigger than  this You would have to use one blue	It wouldnt be the exact size	4.0
It wouldnt be the exact size	So you cant make a model any bigger than  this without making a train making all these uneven	4.0
So you cant make a model any bigger than  this without making a train making all these uneven	So basically  this is the only model you can make thats even without using  trains like this one here that would make  all of these unequal	4.0
So if I wanted to continue my train with oranges youre saying I  would have trouble showing	Another four no another four oranges to fit five more of the  browns on so it would be a yard long probably	4.0
If you wan if  you wanted to make a train though where you were adding a  different color rod on the end of this train of four oranges do you  think you could come up with other models	Well it could be but this is the basically the only equal  model  using you know tenths twentieths fortieths	4.0
Well it could be but this is the basically the only equal  model  using you know tenths twentieths fortieths	for the whole	4.0
Because you know I see thirteen things here	I dont think they know how to count	0.0
I dont think they know how to count	I think Meredith sabotaged it	0.0
I think Meredith sabotaged it	Well I think I think yesterday maybe it was three blues	3.0
Well I think I think yesterday maybe it was three blues	No it was smaller	1.0
It looks pretty well lets get it  this is the model you guys just had  right	No we had one that was straighter	0.0
Okay now these are all even but I see yeah there s  thirteen arent there	We dont need twelfths	3.0
We dont need twelfths	Thats the whole point	3.0
Thats the whole point	Whats the point of twelfths	2.0
Whats the point of twelfths	The point is two thirds and three  fourths	3.0
The point is two thirds and three  fourths	The answer is one twelfth	3.0
The answer is one twelfth	Meredith I made this thing to show that when you double it	0.0
Meredith I made this thing to show that when you double it	To  show that when you double it	0.0
To  show that when you double it	The reds were one twelfths now the  reds aren t one twelfths now the reds are uh	3.0
The reds were one twelfths now the  reds aren t one twelfths now the reds are uh	So youre trying to show that with different models thirds that  theyre twelfths that if the numbers will change no theyre  changing size but they dont change in answer	4.0
Graham told me	Well one half plus one half equals a whole and two fourths  plus two fourths equals a whole	4.0
Does that make sense	Uh I think theyre kind of off	4.0
Uh I think theyre kind of off	Its true but theyre kind of  off	4.0
Its true but theyre kind of  off	Its true that one half plus one half equals one whole but  two fourths plus two fourths equals four fourths which is one  whole	4.0
Hold on lets hear what David has to say for a  moment	Well I was thinking	4.0
Well I was thinking	That uh that like four fourths equals  one half which equals two halves	4.0
Say that one more time David	Uh four fourths should be equals one half	4.0
Uh four fourths should be equals one half	four fourths equals one half	1.0
four fourths equals one half	four fourths	0.0
four fourths	Two fourths	1.0
Two fourths	two fourths oh wait one whole	1.0
two fourths oh wait one whole	four fourths is equal to one whole	4.0
four fourths is equal to one whole	Yeah thats what I mean	1.0
four fourths equals one whole	Yeah um and two fourths is equal to one half	4.0
Why	Because um two fourths uh would be equal to right up  right next to is like in the middle of like one whole and um	4.0
In the middle between numbers	zero and one	3.0
Ok	and um so then one half of it would be in the same place	3.0
Ok	So the half would have to be in the same place	3.0
Ok	because if you put them right next to each other the one half  would be in the same place as both of them because would  one half would be equals on both sides	4.0
Want to take you picture with you	I just drew it like that  because	4.0
I just drew it like that  because	thats the one whole um these are the one fourth and thats  the one half and this would be zero and that would be one	4.0
Can you place your numbers here  now	You mean like one half	3.0
It helps you to place those  numbers	Yes	0.0
What do the rest of  you think of that	I like it	0.0
Thank you very much David	I agree with him	1.0
Jakki	Its sort of like the Cuisenaire Rods	3.0
Yeah that helps me a lot doesnt it	Its supposed to be the purple rod one fourth would be the  white and the half is like the red or the purple I think	4.0
Jessica	Well I think it is sort of a new way to make a number line	3.0
Its a way to build it isnt it	Yeah	0.0
Michael	Uhm I when I was working at home trying to make a  number line I um found out that if you um do like one whole  divided by two you would need would get like one half  because you would take one plus like that and then or  you could get two fourths if you divided it by two so that  would prove that two fourths and one half are the same	4.0
James	Uhm I have another way to do it	0.0
Uhm I have another way to do it	I also drew a picture	0.0
Ok do you like to share it with us	Ok	0.0
Would you like to do it on this side	Ok	0.0
Ok	This is one half  and this is two  fourths  two fourths I made a circle  and divided it into 4ths and colored in two fourths and it  shows it equals one half	4.0
This is one half  and this is two  fourths  two fourths I made a circle  and divided it into 4ths and colored in two fourths and it  shows it equals one half	One side of this and two sides of  this both are one half	4.0
What do you think of that	s I agree	1.0
And that  would therefore enable you to put them in the same place on  the number line	Yes	0.0
TRUE or false or open	Open	3.0
Open	Open	1.0
Hum could you tell me something that I could write in the box that would make a false statement Brian	Uh five	3.0
Yes	Uh hum	0.0
Michael what would that be	Two	3.0
Now what I d like you to do is make a legal substitution that would produce a false statement	Oh six six	3.0
Where do you want me to write the six	Put six plus six equals eight	4.0
Okay was that legal	No	0.0
No	Yes it was legal	3.0
Yes it was legal	Yes it was	1.0
Yes it was	But it was a false statement	1.0
Six plus six equals eight true or false	False	3.0
Michael	Six and two	3.0
Okay is that legal or illegal	Illegal	3.0
Illegal	Illegal	1.0
Illegal	Illegal because he didn t put the same number in both boxes	4.0
Illegal because he didn t put the same number in both boxes	What does that say	0.0
What does that say	I	0.0
Bobby	Six plus eight	3.0
Six plus what	Eight	3.0
How about that	It could be better	3.0
He did what he wanted it to do and it is illegal because he doesn t have the same thing in both boxes	I like fifty	3.0
And the statement six plus eight equals eight	That was really good	0.0
Is certainly false	I have to think of these	0.0
Okay somebody ask the next question	Someone ask the next question	0.0

But there is two different possible answers though	I think I got it I think I got it but I m not sure but I think I got it	0.0
Michelle	Two	3.0
Two	Yeah	0.0
Everybody agrees with that	Oh I don t want it to be right	0.0
Matt can you show that	I have a different number	1.0
I have a different number	I think it might work with three	3.0
Yeah okay and	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Two and three work that works	3.0
How much is that	Negative six	3.0
How much is that	Plus the six would be zero	3.0
Plus the six would be zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Yes	1.0
Yes	Thank You	0.0
And so when I say that s equal to zero is that true or false	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	True	3.0
True	That was three	3.0
Do I put the two here or here	No three wouldn t work	3.0
No three wouldn t work	In the brackets	1.0
It goes in the truth set that makes it true	Let s try three now	3.0
Let s try three now	Three	1.0
Now various people are saying three	Three is not going to work	3.0
You say three you say three  it works	It is	3.0
It is	It works	3.0
It works	Three is going to work	1.0
Three is going to work	I m just thinking don t	0.0
I m just thinking don t	No	1.0
No	It works	1.0
It works	It works	1.0
So it says nine minus fifteen how much is that	Negative six	3.0
That is negative six but we are not through then it says plus six how much is that	Zero	3.0
Okay so when we say that s equal to zero up there is it true or false	It s true	3.0
Okay well I ve got some of these that I made up that I am wondering if I can get any of them cause they re so hard that none of you can do them	How about if we make something and have it like be impossible	3.0

The first one is easy	It s right up there	1.0
It s right up there	Do we write both of them	0.0
Okay	Should we go onto the next one	0.0
You may as well	Didn t we do this one already	0.0

Well maybe if we add more we will still be	See my question are you listening to me	1.0
See my question are you listening to me	Yes	1.0
Yes	It s got to equal minus fiftyfive	1.0
It s got to equal minus fiftyfive	What times six in the one space would equal five	2.0
What times six in the one space would equal five	It s got to equal zero	1.0
It s got to equal zero	Yeah but it has to equal minus fiftyfive plus fiftyfive equals zero so what times six would equal five in the one spot	2.0
Yeah but it has to equal minus fiftyfive plus fiftyfive equals zero so what times six would equal five in the one spot	Five times five is twentyfive	4.0
Five times five is twentyfive	Eighty that s minus eighty plus fiftyfive equals zero	4.0

Yeah make a legal substitution but make it true	Four four one	3.0
Four four one	What about two	1.0
What about two	What about one one seven and what about two two five	1.0
What about one one seven and what about two two five	Three three and three	1.0
How about three three and three	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Six four and two	3.0

Six four and two that s twelve	It s eleven idiot	1.0
It s eleven idiot	Six four and two	1.0
Six four and two	Oh	0.0
Be quiet so you can hear Amy Lynn	Well I think that three three and three is legal because like it s it s legal for like the two boxes and then like the triangle is a whole new shape so you can start all over again	4.0
That is exactly correct	Go Amy	0.0
Go Amy	Alright Amy	0.0
Alright Amy	What did you say Amy	1.0
What did you say Amy	She said something how it s legal for some stupid reason	1.0
Some people didn t hear	Alright The two boxes alright it s can be three it s a legal move and then the triangle it can start all over again with any number	4.0
Alright The two boxes alright it s can be three it s a legal move and then the triangle it can start all over again with any number	It s a whole you can start all over again	4.0
So it is legal and it s certainly true Is that alright	Zippyedydodah	0.0
Zippyedydodah	A proctologist	0.0
I want to show you how really there are lots of things you can do four four one	What about two two and five	3.0
The way that people sometimes keep track of that	How about five five and minus one	4.0
How about five five and minus one	That should work five five minus one that equals nine	4.0
Yeah Mike why don t you come up and explain one right up here and explain it	What number	0.0
It s your choice not one but two or three or four or five	I ll do number two	0.0
Uh OK you see where the	For whenever you have a number under the triangle there has to   be a pattern see five and seven the difference is two	4.0
For whenever you have a number under the triangle there has to   be a pattern see five and seven the difference is two	Five plus two is seven	4.0
Five plus two is seven	Seven plus two is nine nine plus two is eleven apparently it s two you see here	4.0
Seven plus two is nine nine plus two is eleven apparently it s two you see here	OK since two and of the first number which is going to be box times two equals no plus something	4.0
OK since two and of the first number which is going to be box times two equals no plus something	Zero can go into five five times	4.0
Well	Yeah whatever so we leave that one out	4.0
Yeah whatever so we leave that one out	One goes into seven  seven times leave that one out	4.0
One goes into seven  seven times leave that one out	The two does not go into nine so   take one out to make it eight so we re going to have to have plus   one	4.0
The two does not go into nine so   take one out to make it eight so we re going to have to have plus   one	So this two goes into eight	4.0
So this two goes into eight	Two times four is eight plus one is nine so that s nine	4.0
Two times four is eight plus one is nine so that s nine	The eleven take one away and it s ten but it doesn t go into ten	4.0
The eleven take one away and it s ten but it doesn t go into ten	So you take one away so you re going to have to take one away from eight so it s going to be seven	4.0
Matt	It is box times two but it is plus five	3.0
It is box times two but it is plus five	What s the first number on  the right	2.0
So he says	Box times two would be fine but then you add five	3.0
You want to write that	So plus five	3.0
So plus five	It ll work	3.0
You all know that	Yeah	0.0
You all know that	Yeah	0.0
You know that s a very important set of ideas in mathematics	What about number six	2.0
What about number six	I think we have something for six but	0.0
You think you ve got something for six	I think we found out how to write it	0.0
You found out how to write it OK well come and show people	Can we do this like	0.0
Now wait maybe you don t want to do that you re right	Aw can we just show you	0.0
Yeah let s just show the camera huh let s just show the camera	Can we show you first	0.0
I ll be right back OK	I m not saying anything	0.0
I m not saying anything	OK the number in the the two numbers in the brackets are always the same and the number after the bracket is always one	4.0
When she says you can talk you can talk	The two numbers in the brackets are always the same	4.0
The two numbers in the brackets are always the same	the number after the bracket is always one	4.0
OK now you certainly managed to write it could you write it using the box and triangle method of writing	What do you mean	2.0
See if you can do that	Like two times two just write the problem	3.0
Yeah Michelle almost said it when you were down here before	I did	0.0
You ve got something you want to tell the camera	Yeah	0.0
Well come on up tell the camera	if you do this zero times two plus one you get one and that s that so move it up there	4.0
if you do this zero times two plus one you get one and that s that so move it up there	Then one times two plus one is three and that s that	4.0
Then one times two plus one is three and that s that	And then two times two plus one is five	4.0
And then two times two plus one is five	And three times two plus one is seven and there s that and four times two plus one is nine and there it is	4.0
And three times two plus one is seven and there s that and four times two plus one is nine and there it is	And five times two plus one equals eleven	4.0
And five times two plus one equals eleven	So it s just like this move that up there	4.0
Take some of these other ideas but write them have you done it	Yeah	0.0
Well at some point we will we need to talk about	You ve got to try and figure it out first though before we tell you	0.0
Yeah I think it s a good idea to try and figure it out yourself	OK the number here the number that s here you see will always go here and always in this place will go the one and the answer goes here which is four the answer is seventeen	4.0
Yeah that s certainly right OK um can you think of a way to write it so that we ll know that the number that goes here has to go here too	Like we did on the back	0.0
No with symbols and boxes and triangles we	Can we do it like this	0.0
Can we do it like this	The box here and the box here	0.0
Yeah you want to go and do that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I just have to write one more thing	0.0
You re talking about this one right here	OK well it s a zero times one and then it s like the plus one and then it goes from like the one times one cause it s just zero one two three four five	4.0
OK well it s a zero times one and then it s like the plus one and then it goes from like the one times one cause it s just zero one two three four five	And then it goes one one two	4.0
And then it goes one one two	You see there	0.0
It could be zero	Yeah it could be zero	0.0
Yeah it could be zero	Zero one two three four five	0.0
Zero one two three four five	And then you just keep the plus one and you go	3.0
See if you can	OK	0.0
OK	What do you mean by box and triangle notation	2.0
You ve got it OK let s get it down	It s the wrong way he s got it backwards	1.0
It s the wrong way he s got it backwards	When the box is here the number that goes here that goes in the next box would be legal	4.0
When the box is here the number that goes here that goes in the next box would be legal	So these two have to be the same	4.0
Yup do you agree	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And this is always one and the triangle is the answer	3.0
That is great	Yes	0.0
Yes	Is that what you were thinking	0.0
Yeah that s what I did but I didn t invent it somebody told me it	We invented it	0.0
Uh Ankur and Michelle think they have	We ve got a secret	0.0
You have	But the things changed the equation other than the triangles	3.0
But the things changed the equation other than the triangles	Things change almost the whole entire equation	3.0
Do you want to come and write it and tell it to the camera	So the equation can change	3.0
Well it s going to have to be different from this it wouldn t be that it ll be a different kind of equation	The only difference between this and that is	0.0
The only difference between this and that is	Can you change the numbers in the triangle	0.0
Can you change the numbers in the triangle	Please say yes	0.0
Well there might actually be ways to do that too	We did that and it works the way I have it	0.0
We did that and it works the way I have it	But the difference between one and four is three the difference between four and seven is three the difference between seven and ten is three that means that s going to be the first number three cause box times three But the pattern in this is one three five seven and nine so how are we going to	4.0
Do you remember what you said	We re thinking what we should say	0.0
Because remember you said something before	Just tell them what we got for the written answer not like the code	0.0
The number outside the box had to be the same as the number inside the box	But that will give it away	0.0
Oh no it wont	Well not exactly we didn t get the code right after we did that	0.0
OK it would be worth listening because this is a very interesting idea and they re trying to be careful they re still giving you a chance to invent it but they re going to tell you something worth thinking about	They don t want to give us a chance	0.0
They don t want to give us a chance	They just want to be smart and keep it from us	0.0
They just want to be smart and keep it from us	Well this is what we got but you have to write it in the code	0.0
Well can we get it quiet please Jeffery and everybody can we get it quiet please	The number you add after the bracket is always one	3.0
Isn t that true a lot of people have decided on that	Yeah we got that	1.0
Yeah we got that	And the number that is here is always the number that s in the box cause if you put zero here zero times zero is zero plus one equals one	4.0
And the number that is here is always the number that s in the box cause if you put zero here zero times zero is zero plus one equals one	What about three	2.0
What about three	Yeah but figure out the rest yourself	1.0
Yeah but figure out the rest yourself	Jeff the number that goes here always goes here	3.0
Jeff the number that goes here always goes here	You have to figure out what the code is	3.0
OK wait a second can we get it quiet please because I want to hear what Michael is saying	For number three the difference between one and four is three the difference between four and seven is three too and the difference between seven and ten is three so that is going to be the first number but on number 6 the difference between one and two is one and the difference between two and five is three so which one goes in the box	4.0
What you just said	Which ever number goes here	0.0
Which ever number goes here	Yeah but the problem is	0.0
Yeah but the problem is	Listen Mike this is zero and it goes in the box so it has to go here too	4.0
Listen Mike this is zero and it goes in the box so it has to go here too	No but we re trying to find out what goes in the second	1.0
No but we re trying to find out what goes in the second	In this in this	1.0
In this in this	No no	1.0
No no	If you put a one in here one times one is one plus one is two	4.0
If you put a one in here one times one is one plus one is two	What goes here	2.0
What goes here	Whatever goes in the box goes here if this is ten then ten goes here if this is five then five goes here	4.0
Whatever goes in the box goes here if this is ten then ten goes here if this is five then five goes here	Whatever s in the box goes next	1.0
Whatever s in the box goes next	And one always goes here	1.0
And one always goes here	It works every time	1.0
Let me keep track of where we stand because I m getting a little confused	We have to write a code	0.0
We have to write a code	How we got it or something	0.0
Do you want to say it to the camera	No I don t want to say it	0.0
No I don t want to say it	This is going to be the number in the square multiplied by itself plus one always is going to give you the answer	3.0
Yeah what have you written here that s very interesting	Zero times zero plus one equals one	4.0
Do you want to do it	Not really	0.0
Let me give you the microphone	Uh I don t want to	0.0
But it s a great idea	But what am I going to say though	0.0
Well you can say here this is a good idea	That s easy	0.0
Here s the microphone let me get out of the way	How am I going to do this though	2.0
Well here s what you can do	Can I draw it on this	0.0
Well you could	Yeah I ll just draw it on this and show it as an example	0.0
Yeah I ll just draw it on this and show it as an example	When am I going	0.0
So um Jeff is going to tell you about this problem right here	Well what it is no	0.0
Well what it is no	Can I start	0.0
Can I start	OK	0.0
OK	The number over in the box is always going to multiply by itself in the parenthesis and then you re going to add it by one and you ll get the number that s supposed to be in the triangle	4.0
The number over in the box is always going to multiply by itself in the parenthesis and then you re going to add it by one and you ll get the number that s supposed to be in the triangle	The same thing with this one here one times one is one plus one equals two	4.0
The same thing with this one here one times one is one plus one equals two	Two times two is four plus one equals five and it just works for the rest of the six	4.0
Two times two is four plus one equals five and it just works for the rest of the six	Is that it	0.0
See if you can you helped them get it can you come and explain it to the camera	Yes	0.0
Yes	OK you can talk this time	0.0
OK you can talk this time	Well you see that number is the same as that number the code would be square times square plus one equals triangle	4.0
Yeah that s neat but you didn t write it that way	I didn t put the square	0.0
Because the rule says whatever you write in one square you have to write the same in the other square	That s the same as that	3.0
That s very nice OK why don t you write it on this paper now	You could write it	0.0
You could write it	Oh come on	0.0
Oh come on	Just write the code	0.0
Thank you very much	When you minus this one from this one you get the multiplying number	4.0
Yeah why don t you say that to the camera	I already did	0.0
It doesn t work for all of them	Could we tell everybody the code	0.0
OK let me say the people with the secret would like to publish it now when scientists really discovered something they do what they call publishing they send it to a journal and it gets printed and everybody reads it	You have the box time that plus one is the triangle	3.0
You have the box time that plus one is the triangle	Someone pick a number that will go like here	1.0
OK Ankur says tell him a number and he ll tell you how it works	Eightysix	3.0
Eightysix	Eightysix is too high	1.0
Eightysix is too high	They want eightysix we ll give them eightysix	1.0
They want eightysix we ll give them eightysix	We don t care just show us how to do it	0.0
We don t care just show us how to do it	They re just going to do eighty six to make us mad	0.0
They re just going to do eighty six to make us mad	Now what s eighty six times eightysix you said eightysix now figure that out	2.0
Now what s eighty six times eightysix you said eightysix now figure that out	You said you could solve	0.0
You said you could solve	Do it	0.0
Do it	We can if we had a piece of paper	0.0
We can if we had a piece of paper	If you have the number here and the number here is going to be the same as the number here what do you think that is going to be for the code	2.0
OK this is really the key pint so it would be very important to listen carefully because they re really telling you the secret	If the number here is going to be the same as the umber here what shape do you think that is going to be	2.0
If the number here is going to be the same as the umber here what shape do you think that is going to be	A square	1.0
A square	That s it that s the whole thing that s the code	1.0
That s it that s the whole thing that s the code	That s the code	1.0
That s the code	Isn t that easy	0.0
Isn t that easy	That s the code  square times square plus one equals triangle	1.0
That s what you had too isn t it	I told you	0.0
I told you	That isn t very difficult If we knew what it was we just didn t put it down how it was supposed to be	0.0
Lets see if anybody can do number 7 then	We re done with it	0.0
Come say it for the camera here	So it s like 0 times 0  5 equals thing	4.0
So it s like 0 times 0  5 equals thing	And you d just get that moving to like 1 times 1 2 times 2 3 times 3 and 4 times 4	4.0
Say the first one again	Well 5  5	4.0
Right	So 5  6	4.0
So 5  6	And 59	4.0
So how would you write that with this box triangle notation	Box times Box  5  Triangle	3.0
Can you write it for me	What way	2.0
What way	This way	2.0
Nice	It s the same problem	0.0
Here s your microphone	Okay	0.0
Okay	It was the same problem with the same like code as the one before	4.0
It was the same problem with the same like code as the one before	Box times box but instead of plus 1 it s plus 5 equals the number	4.0
Box times box but instead of plus 1 it s plus 5 equals the number	Equals triangle	4.0
With the boxes and triangles	So it would be like box times box plus 5 equals triangle	3.0
Thanks	It s easy	0.0
That s very nice	Thank you	0.0
You got another one you got eight good heavens	We got eight too	1.0
We got eight too	OK she has everything written down	0.0
OK she has everything written down	Put it so the camera can see it	0.0
Put it so the camera can see it	It s box times box minus box equals triangle	4.0
Thats wonderful	Good	0.0
I didn t think you d get that one	And it works every time	0.0
And it works every time	That was easy once you get the basic one	0.0
You ve got nine	We ve got another code	0.0
Why don t you talk this time	Number nine	3.0
OK are you going to explain it	OK we had the zero times the zero and then plus zero and we got zero	4.0
OK we had the zero times the zero and then plus zero and we got zero	Then we added one so it s one times zero plus a half and we got a half	4.0
Then we added one so it s one times zero plus a half and we got a half	And then we did zero one two times zero plus two equals two	4.0
And then we did zero one two times zero plus two equals two	And then we did one two three three times zero plus four and a half equals four and a half	4.0
And then we did one two three three times zero plus four and a half equals four and a half	And then you took four times zero plus eight equals eight	4.0
And then you took four times zero plus eight equals eight	And then five times zero plus twelve and a half equals twelve and a half	4.0
And then five times zero plus twelve and a half equals twelve and a half	Six times zero plus eighteen equals eighteen	4.0
Where do you suppose those halves are coming from what do you suppose is making those halves appear in that problem	Uh the whole	3.0
OK all four of you are coming to explain this right	What number are you explaining	0.0
What number are you explaining	Number eight	0.0
Number eight	Romina you have the best handwriting	0.0
You need to show Roger which one you want him to be getting	This one right here	0.0
This one right here	Oh I have to talk	0.0
Oh I have to talk	You can talk this time	0.0
You can talk this time	Fine I ll talk I don t care we ll both talk it doesn t make a difference	0.0
Fine I ll talk I don t care we ll both talk it doesn t make a difference	OK I don t know how to explain it	2.0
OK I don t know how to explain it	You divide the triangle by the square so you just divide the triangle by the square then we wrote it like a code	4.0
You divide the triangle by the square so you just divide the triangle by the square then we wrote it like a code	So six divided by three is two	4.0
So six divided by three is two	Tone it down some	0.0
Tone it down some	Oh her ears are hurting	0.0
Oh her ears are hurting	So you divide twenty by five and that s four thirty by six that s five twelve by four that s three	4.0
So you divide twenty by five and that s four thirty by six that s five twelve by four that s three	But do this you multiply six times five plus zero because zero was the first number up in the triangle	4.0
But do this you multiply six times five plus zero because zero was the first number up in the triangle	So on the board like its square times square it s square times like when you divide twelve by four that number goes in the second place	4.0
What do I get at that point	You get the answer	0.0
What answer	You see that s	0.0
So here I would take the six and divide it by three	Get two	3.0
What s the two	You see three goes into six two times and if you set it up like this three times two plus zero you get six and that s that number I didn t put the triangle in	4.0
OK that s an interesting idea	We have it it s triangle divided by square	3.0
We have it it s triangle divided by square	But then we have to put times something	3.0
You tell me you get something why don t you say equals and tell me what you get	Divided it s not plus	3.0
Oh I see something interesting is happening	It goes up like one two three four five and you multiply six times five plus zero and you get that number	4.0
I think that if you keep thinking about it you might find some other ways	Let s find out number nine and then go back to it	0.0
You want to come and tell the camera no OK	Could I go get a quick drink	0.0
Could I go get a quick drink	This is the one for nine	0.0
Who s doing the talking you doing the talking	Michelle figured it out	0.0
Let s try and get it where Roger can see it	You multiply the one times one and then subtract a half of one	4.0
You multiply the one times one and then subtract a half of one	And then you multiply two times two and then subtract half of two times two and then you get your answer which is triangle	4.0
And then you multiply two times two and then subtract half of two times two and then you get your answer which is triangle	Three times three is nine and minus four and a half and that s your answer four and a half	4.0
Three times three is nine and minus four and a half and that s your answer four and a half	It keeps going on	0.0
You want to say it to the camera or to everybody	It s just for number eight	0.0
Who s talking	He can	0.0
He can	Well like here it s zero and then it goes plus two then plus four then plus six then plus eight then plus ten	4.0
Well like here it s zero and then it goes plus two then plus four then plus six then plus eight then plus ten	Then more plus twelve then plus fourteen	4.0
You wouldn t be willing to tell that to everybody	Yeah why not	0.0
Yeah why not	It works for this one	3.0
Would you explain it to everybody	It starts atyou explain it I m not good at explaining it	0.0
It starts atyou explain it I m not good at explaining it	Here it s zero and then this is two then four then six eight then ten and if you keep going down it would be twelve fourteen if it went on	4.0
OK I think that s worth thinking about Jeffery did you have something to show	Should I show everyone	0.0
OK anybody else coming to help or are you doing it by yourself	I ll do it by myself	0.0
I ll do it by myself	Basically when you start with two zeros you re going to subtract you know how when it s like box times box plus one equals triangle but if it s there s two zeros starting out it s going to be box times box minus a number equals triangle	4.0
Basically when you start with two zeros you re going to subtract you know how when it s like box times box plus one equals triangle but if it s there s two zeros starting out it s going to be box times box minus a number equals triangle	We don t really know but we tried different numbers and it works out every time	4.0
We don t really know but we tried different numbers and it works out every time	Yes you do if there s double zeros on the thing you minus	4.0
Yes you do if there s double zeros on the thing you minus	Yeah we did we subtracted on eight and subtracted on nine too	4.0
Yeah we did we subtracted on eight and subtracted on nine too	No I m not going to show you my paper	0.0
OK but they re carefully not showing you their formula but they did tell you one interesting thing to think about	We re ready to explain what we got	0.0
Okay	OK everybody goes up	0.0
OK everybody goes up	Should I write I don t think I should write	0.0
Should I write I don t think I should write	I don t know what to write	0.0
I don t know what to write	Should I just this out	0.0
Should I just this out	Well see don t erase the whole thing	0.0
Well see don t erase the whole thing	OK you just divide basically to get the answer	4.0
OK you just divide basically to get the answer	Like divide two into two and you get one if you multiply two times one plus zero you get two and that s what you re supposed to get because two s in the triangle	4.0
Like divide two into two and you get one if you multiply two times one plus zero you get two and that s what you re supposed to get because two s in the triangle	And the triangle s supposed to be at the end	4.0
And the triangle s supposed to be at the end	Divide six times three and you get two	4.0
I think you mean divide six by three and you get two	You do	0.0
You do	Awesome and that s one and then you take the one and the two out of there and the two times one I have to move down and then you just plus zero cause that s the number you have up there to start with and then it equals that two	4.0
Awesome and that s one and then you take the one and the two out of there and the two times one I have to move down and then you just plus zero cause that s the number you have up there to start with and then it equals that two	This number should always be in the triangle at the end	4.0
Now we wouldn t solve it today it s a very hard problem no the one that I m about to show you	Is that number 10	0.0
Now we re certainly not going to solve that today but I ll bet you you are going to solve it in the next few weeks	Are you coming back next week	0.0
Good heavens	When we have to multiply box times box could it be box plus box	3.0
Could be all kinds of things	I got it	0.0
I got it	You re the one who started it	0.0
Are you ready to explain that to the camera	Well we have to make sure it works sixteen and sixteen is thirty two	4.0
Well we have to make sure it works sixteen and sixteen is thirty two	It does work but sixtythree	4.0
It does work but sixtythree	What about us	0.0
Do you want to say it to the camera or do you want to say it to everybody	Camera	0.0
Camera	Okay	0.0
OK here s the microphone	I explain OK	0.0
I explain OK	Well see one is the difference between zero and one	4.0
Well see one is the difference between zero and one	And if you add one plus one it equals two which is the difference there	4.0
And if you add one plus one it equals two which is the difference there	And two plus two is four which is the difference between there	4.0
And two plus two is four which is the difference between there	Four plus four is eight which is the difference between there	4.0
Four plus four is eight which is the difference between there	And you add sixteen and sixteen which is thirty two the difference between there and so on	4.0
And you add sixteen and sixteen which is thirty two the difference between there and so on	See the numbers you add that number with itself and you get the answer which is the difference betweenthe next numbers	4.0
What number am I looking at here	Between zero and one is one	3.0
So what am I going to do add that	You add one and one and you get two which is the difference between there	4.0
Oh ah that s really clever	If you add the one and two you get three	4.0
If you add the one and two you get three	And so on you do it for everything	4.0
Can we talk for one second about keeping secrets	We shouldn t keep secrets	0.0
What s the bad thing about keeping secrets	Other people wouldn t find out	0.0
Other people wouldn t find out	If another person finds out and says it as long as you	0.0
If another person finds out and says it as long as you	As long as you eventually tell it s all right	0.0
As long as you eventually tell it s all right	Could you keep it for a couple weeks and see how many people die before I give it out	0.0
I think we do need to keep thinking about it we do need to find a way to this so that everybody s comfortable with it but there is also a case to be made for keeping secrets because what I ve said sometimes to people is suppose say Michael and I went to the gym and Michael did a lot of weight lifting and I watched him who gets stronger	He would	0.0
What s that got to do with secrets	Nothing	0.0
Nothing	Oh you would have to do it yourself	0.0
Oh you would have to do it yourself	He s doing the lifting	0.0
He s doing the lifting	If you want to get stronger you got to figure it out	0.0
Cause if you want to be good at figuring things out you better practice figuring things out	But maybe if you want to make sure of things before you do it	0.0
Hum instead of using this method that I was using let s use this method to keep track	I have a question	2.0
I have a question	Shouldn t you make the square a triangle since the square and the triangle	4.0
Shouldn t you make the square a triangle since the square and the triangle	I have a question	2.0
I have a question	What if there is two triangles	2.0
What if there is two triangles	Two times two plus one equals there should be two triangles	4.0
Two times two plus one equals there should be two triangles	That is so stupid	0.0
That is so stupid	Do they have to be the same	1.0
Do they have to be the same	Can t you put a rectangle down and have it	1.0
Yeah	That should be	3.0
Some people use them but the circles look like zeros and if you are	How about a hexagon	3.0
How about a hexagon	Can we use them	0.0
Can we use them	A pentagon	3.0

This is the so called truth set again	Is there a secret here	0.0
Well there might be	I have a question	0.0
I have a question	If you know it how can it be a secret	0.0
If you know it how can it be a secret	He is the only one in the world who knows	0.0

Okay sure	How do you know like is there a secret for every like if I put a square a rectangle a triangle if I put like all of these different shapes how do you know there is a secret for everything	2.0
How do you know like is there a secret for every like if I put a square a rectangle a triangle if I put like all of these different shapes how do you know there is a secret for everything	Why did you have to ask that	0.0
Why did you have to ask that	I just felt like it	0.0
Stephanie says how do you know there is a secret or not	You have to go through the problems and find out	0.0
You have to go through the problems and find out	Yeah but it could work	0.0
Yeah but it could work	You can do like five different problems and it could work and you cannot do this one little problem then it wouldn t work on	3.0
You can do like five different problems and it could work and you cannot do this one little problem then it wouldn t work on	Maybe just one	0.0
Maybe just one	Maybe it just works on everything else but that one	3.0
Maybe it just works on everything else but that one	Yeah but then it doesn t work then	1.0
Yeah but then it doesn t work then	Okay what about the secret that we just figured out	2.0
Okay what about the secret that we just figured out	That won t work on Milin s problem	3.0
That won t work on Milin s problem	Maybe we fixed it	1.0
Maybe we fixed it	It might work in Milin s problem	1.0
It might work in Milin s problem	We just didn t consider using half and fourths	1.0

Can you listen to Milin please	We re guessing um what s going to be the equation	3.0
Now I m going to tell you on these papers here I tell you the truth set and I want you to tell me the equation	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	Like that	3.0
If you figured out the equation write it down	Can I just tell you	0.0
It s kind of hard to say an equation	It s sort of I sort of found how you could make them add up	0.0
It s sort of I sort of found how you could make them add up	Wait here s what I don t get though	0.0
Come show me the equation	He wants me to show you	0.0
He wants me to show you	Excuse me	0.0
Excuse me	I m coming through with an answer	0.0
What are you going to show me ultimately	I got an idea	0.0
You ve got an idea	The times number that you put there you add it to the first number unless it s zero and then you get your answer	3.0
That s certainly what you do	See there s one in between there then two then three then four	3.0
What are we doing now	Making equations	3.0
What s the secret that you have for this	The two numbers when you add them they give you the number on the left and when you multiply them they give you the number on the right	4.0

Matt	I was wondering what does the mean anyway e equals m c squared	2.0
Well that s interesting	How do you use that	2.0
How do you use that	Energy equals	3.0
Yeah that s right e stands for energy do you know what the m stands for	M c squared	3.0
E equals m c squared	Mechanical	3.0
Mechanical	We could look it up	0.0
Why don t you see if you can find out and we can talk about that but I think maybe I propose not to do that today	Maybe a dictionary	0.0
Do you remember what you were trying to find some numbers what did those numbers do	The numbers replaced like the empty boxes or triangles	3.0
Um what s the secret to that	It s one big secret	0.0
Matt	That the the two multiple the two num the numbers have to like when you add them up it has to equal it has to equal the number to the to the left and be multiples of the number to the right	4.0
Well you might not really mean multiples when you multiply them	Yeah be able to multiply them	3.0
Jeff what was special about them	Cause there were two prime numbers in it so it was like impossible	4.0
Cause there were two prime numbers in it so it was like impossible	No	1.0
No	or you had to go into decimals or whatever	3.0
Right and what did we do then Stephanie what did we do	Well we had to put a number in the box and a number in the triangle so that the equation was true	4.0
Exactly what we were doing and when we did that if we put zero in that box what number did we put in the triangle	One	3.0
Uh you remember what you wrote on your paper	No	0.0
Well you suppose you can get it if you wrote small do you suppose you could get it up by the table the way you did it on your paper	Up here	0.0
And you left out one parenthesis do you see where you left it out	oh	0.0
oh	Should I do more	0.0
Well that s probably enough but she went down and did that and you agree that that s what we were doing	Yeah	0.0
Michelle	We tried to find a secret to it with a pattern like how the numbers	3.0
Okay and some of you did find a very interesting secret and it might be an appropriate one to share um no Ankur says that we shouldn t do that	Yes we should	0.0
Here here I gave you the equation and we made the table right but now in the other problems I gave you the table and what are you supposed to do	Find the equation	3.0
Uh and now for the second problem let me pass this back to you	Mike Mike Mike  if you get 1 2 3 right	0.0
Mike Mike Mike  if you get 1 2 3 right	All three of them right then you find out the secret real quick	0.0
All three of them right then you find out the secret real quick	No I won t	0.0
No I won t	You will	0.0
You will	Just tell me the secret	0.0
Just tell me the secret	Am I the only one that doesn t know it	0.0
Am I the only one that doesn t know it	Mike Mike Mike  1 2 and 3	0.0
Mike Mike Mike  1 2 and 3	As soon as you get them you ll find out the secret	0.0
As soon as you get them you ll find out the secret	Ok	0.0
Ok	Trust me	0.0
Trust me	Actually we re getting somewhere	0.0
Actually we re getting somewhere	Yeah because you have Michelle in your group	0.0
Yeah because you have Michelle in your group	She didn t say anything yet	0.0
She didn t say anything yet	Oh thanks a lot that makes me feel good	0.0
Oh thanks a lot that makes me feel good	Why is it going to make you feel bad	0.0
Why is it going to make you feel bad	Because  the only reason you got anything is because Michelle s in your group	0.0
Because  the only reason you got anything is because Michelle s in your group	What about me	0.0
Could I could I get some idea of how we re coming along here	Very good	0.0
Um what s the how many problems have you people done	I already did one	0.0
I already did one	I only did one the first one	0.0
And	I want to see what our little pattern is	0.0
Ankur and Michelle you re on what problem		0.0
	We found the secret	0.0
Good	Hold on  what d you write	0.0
Hold on  what d you write	I want to see what our secret is	0.0
You you want to be careful there might be more than one secret that you might want to think about	I think it s one this time isn t it	3.0
I think it s one this time isn t it	3  it doesn t work	1.0
3  it doesn t work	Oh no  How come it doesn t work	2.0
Oh no  How come it doesn t work	0 times 3 is 0 plus 1 equals 1	4.0
0 times 3 is 0 plus 1 equals 1	Oh 1 ok 1	1.0
See if Milin agrees with you	S 3 times  6  6 plus 5 is 11	4.0
S 3 times  6  6 plus 5 is 11	Yup I got this one	0.0
Yup I got this one	That was easy	0.0
That was easy	It s easy you know you take  if you take  multiply  plus 1  if you minus 1    4 times	4.0
It s easy you know you take  if you take  multiply  plus 1  if you minus 1    4 times	2 plus 5 is 13	4.0
2 plus 5 is 13	It works for everything	0.0
It works for everything	Is that the secret	0.0
Is that the secret	What d you say	1.0
What d you say	It s easy  take 1 away it s 9	4.0
It s easy  take 1 away it s 9	See if you take  these are a multiple of 10	4.0
What s the secret	Is the secret that  this number  if you put the top number up here in this place it works	3.0
Is the secret that  this number  if you put the top number up here in this place it works	Like	0.0
That s right that s a good thing to do  Um at some point  at some point I want you to say uh  let me find out how we can get you to say that with the camera	Okay so  box times 3  box times 3 ok  0 times 3  0 times 3 is 0 plus	4.0
Okay so  box times 3  box times 3 ok  0 times 3  0 times 3 is 0 plus	No	1.0
No	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	0 times 0	1.0
0 times 0	Oh yeah ok ok	1.0
Oh yeah ok ok	1 times 3 is 3 plus 1 equals 4  2 times 3 plus 1 is 7  3 times 3	4.0
1 times 3 is 3 plus 1 equals 4  2 times 3 plus 1 is 7  3 times 3	Ah this is easy	0.0
Ah this is easy	It s easy when you got secrets	0.0
It s easy when you got secrets	He got the secret he finally got the secret	0.0
He got the secret he finally got the secret	Yeah I got number four number four is easy	0.0
Yeah I got number four number four is easy	Mike explain it to me write down on the paper	2.0
Mike explain it to me write down on the paper	NO	0.0
NO	OK the secret is that the first number in the triangle row if you put that in this place right before the equal sign it it ll work all the time so you just have to take the first the first number in the triangle row and put it before the equal sign	4.0
Who else has a secret you re ready to tell to the camera you re not going to tell the whole world but you re going to tell the camera	Oh ok	1.0
Oh ok	Um for here you subtracted like seven minus five and you got two and that s what you added on for each next thing	4.0
Um for here you subtracted like seven minus five and you got two and that s what you added on for each next thing	The difference for each between each two numbers we put that in the first column in the first here right here for number two and on the second one we just figured it out that	1.0
You did that work also on this problem down here	Yeah because see four minus one is three and then that s how we got the three there	4.0
Now here s the microphone for whoever s talking	I don t know	2.0
I don t know	All right well we the five here we use it as a plus number	4.0
All right well we the five here we use it as a plus number	Over here like the one over here we use it as a plus number	4.0
Over here like the one over here we use it as a plus number	And then the seven we used it as a plus number	4.0
You used the two here and the three here how did you find that	Minus the seven for five and the plus six	4.0
Point	See seven if you add the five you take it away from there and one times two	4.0
So you re saying this seven here is that correct	If you minus that from the first number and that s how you get the times sign	4.0
OK you re saying you subtracted the five from the seven	The seven from the five	3.0
You subtract seven from five and I think you get negative two	Oh OK then five from seven	3.0
That s very nice those are very important ideas	You got number six you got number six	0.0
Anybody else have a secret you want to say to the camera	No we know it	0.0
A lot of people are saying they know the secret but they re stuck on a certain problem that s giving them difficulties	I m almost done	0.0
OK is anybody problem six anybody got six	We know what it is but we can t put it inside the thing	0.0
We know what it is but we can t put it inside the thing	Yeah we know it	0.0
Yeah we know it	It keeps going up by two	3.0
It keeps going up by two	No what s in between goes	1.0
No what s in between goes	In between like one three five	1.0
In between like one three five	He means this doesn t go up by two what s in between it goes up by two	1.0
Oh way hey can you come up let s erase this and come and show us OK	Come on Brian	0.0
Now this is the microphone here	Hold on he has to come up	0.0
You got to try and stay out of his way	What should I say what I wrote for number six	0.0
Yeah yeah	Well I think for six that like numbers aren t really like what s in between well what s in between the numbers is two	4.0
Well I think for six that like numbers aren t really like what s in between well what s in between the numbers is two	So like so one what s between one and two is well what I mean is what s between two and five is three and what s between five and ten is five	4.0
So like so one what s between one and two is well what I mean is what s between two and five is three and what s between five and ten is five	Then if when I do all that between one like the numbers in between it goes by two	4.0
Make sure the camera can see it	Well one between one and three is two between three and five is two between five and seven is two and between seven and nine is two	4.0
Thank you	Is there an answer for six	2.0
Im sorry	Is there an answer for six	2.0
Has anybody figured out the equation for six	We keep getting those stupid fours in the way	0.0
We keep getting those stupid fours in the way	Negative number	3.0
OK come and say that to the camera why don t you	This one s ten plus ten that s twenty	4.0
This one s ten plus ten that s twenty	I didn t figure it out but it has something to do with the prime numbers but	4.0
OK whoever s going to talk needs the mike who s talking	We re both talking	0.0
You re both talking	Hes listening	0.0
You ve got to hold the mike	See um this is how we did it like like you talk	0.0
See um this is how we did it like like you talk	Whatever the first number is equals the second number	3.0
Whatever the first number is equals the second number	Whatever number in the box is here	1.0
Whatever number in the box is here	So we put two in the second one and always one goes here so if this is three three goes here and plus one	4.0
So we put two in the second one and always one goes here so if this is three three goes here and plus one	See and if it works here three times three would be nine and then the one there would be ten	4.0
See and if it works here three times three would be nine and then the one there would be ten	So if it s four	1.0
But you haven t quite really found the formula really	So if it s four we get four and four that equals eight sixteen and then plus one	4.0
So if it s four we get four and four that equals eight sixteen and then plus one	I think that the secret is that the number in the box always goes always goes next to it	1.0
That s a really neat idea that s a really neat idea	Is that the secret	0.0
If you can find a way to write it you ve really got it figured out	OK you can be A I ll be B	0.0
OK you can be A I ll be B	Sarah do you	0.0
Sarah do you	Put two down	0.0
Put two down	Three two two	0.0
K uh Teacher 1 should we switch people back here	Sarah move over a little bit	0.0
Sarah move over a little bit	I cant get my chair in	0.0
I cant get my chair in	Okay	0.0
Okay	We have this now	0.0
We have this now	We gonna were gonna write	0.0
We gonna were gonna write	Ooo good	0.0
Ooo good	We re going to do ten	0.0
We re going to do ten	Let me see what you have	0.0
Let me see what you have	No dont give her anything	0.0
No dont give her anything	What will they think we re doing	0.0
What will they think we re doing	See look we re going to do ten	0.0
See look we re going to do ten	We re gonna copy	0.0
Show me over here	Dont ask	0.0
Dont ask	This is um I did the probability	3.0
This is um I did the probability	next one	0.0
next one	To help figure out why player B had an advantage	3.0
What do you think	And player B Player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	3.0
Can you tell me what these numbers mean over here	Alright	0.0
Alright	Okay	0.0
Okay	These are the dice numbers	3.0
These are the dice numbers	Like numbers that can be rolled on the two die and one s not there cause you can t roll one	3.0
Like numbers that can be rolled on the two die and one s not there cause you can t roll one	And these are the number of times that number  s rolled	3.0
Okay	Um see um	0.0
Um see um	Two is only rolled once	3.0
Two is only rolled once	Three is rolled twice	3.0
Three is rolled twice	Four is rolled three times	3.0
Okay so two is rolled how many times	Once	3.0
Three is rolled two times	Three is rolled twice	3.0
Three is rolled twice	And four is rolled	0.0
And six	Four times	3.0
Four times	Six is five times and seven is six times	3.0
Six is five times and seven is six times	There are like six combinations like you know	3.0
So why do you who has the advantage are you saying	Um Player B	4.0
Um Player B	Because player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	4.0
Because player B has the more commonly rolled numbers	Even though Player A has one um more number Player B still has the more commonly rolled	4.0
Even though Player A has one um more number Player B still has the more commonly rolled	Like player A only has the numbers that only have like one combination two combinations you know	4.0
Like player A only has the numbers that only have like one combination two combinations you know	Whereas player B has the numbers with like the six combinations and the five combination	4.0
So how did you think of doing it this way Stephanie	Alright well what happened was I was playing the game with my dad	0.0
Mhmm	And my dad asked me what I was going to do	0.0
And my dad asked me what I was going to do	And I said I wasnt sure that d I d prol I have to prove that player B has more of an like an advantage over player A but I wasnt really sure if he did because player A had more numbers than player B	4.0
And I said I wasnt sure that d I d prol I have to prove that player B has more of an like an advantage over player A but I wasnt really sure if he did because player A had more numbers than player B	And he asked me how many numbers could be rolled	0.0
Mhmm	And I told him	0.0
And I told him	And he asked how many times can they be rolled	0.0
And he asked how many times can they be rolled	And I m like I don t know	0.0
And I m like I don t know	So he was like why dont you show me	0.0
So he was like why dont you show me	And so then I made  we made this	0.0
OK tell me about this	Alright	0.0
Alright	This is another form of this	0.0
This is another form of this	And actually this is harder to follow	0.0
And actually this is harder to follow	This is the same thing only without the dots	3.0
That s interesting	Alright	0.0
Do you want to sit down	Oh sure	0.0
Come on over here on the side that s where I can see you	Alright	0.0
Alright	What this is is this is um these are both dice	3.0
What this is is this is um these are both dice	This is dice number one and this is dice number two	3.0
Okay	Alright	0.0
Alright	Now the number two can be rolled once	3.0
Mhm	The number three can be rolled twice	3.0
How is that	And it shows you down here this is maybe OK the number two can be rolled once	3.0
And it shows you down here this is maybe OK the number two can be rolled once	The number three can be wait hold on this one  s easier to follow	0.0
The number three can be wait hold on this one  s easier to follow	Yeah wait here the number two can be rolled once	3.0
Mhmm	Number three can be rolled twice	3.0
What are the two ways	Umm	0.0
Umm	Two and one and one and two	3.0
Okay	The number thr the number four can be rolled three times	3.0
Mhmm	The number five can be rolled four times	3.0
Mhmm	Number six can be rolled five times	4.0
Number six can be rolled five times	Number seven can be rolled six times	4.0
Number seven can be rolled six times	Number eight can be rolled five times	4.0
Number eight can be rolled five times	Number nine can be rolled four times	4.0
Number nine can be rolled four times	Number ten can be rolled three times	4.0
Number ten can be rolled three times	Number eleven can be two times and number twelve can be rolled one time	4.0
You can tell me what they are	Yeah	0.0
So nine can you tell me what nine is for example	Sure	0.0
Sure	Nine can be rolled with wait let me show you that one on here	0.0
Nine can be rolled with wait let me show you that one on here	No okay	0.0
No okay	Nine can be rolled with six wait OK six and three	3.0
OK	Five and four	3.0
OK	Wait OK	0.0
Wait OK	I showed five and four	3.0
I showed five and four	Four and five	3.0
OK	And three and six	3.0
And three and six	And yeah thats it	0.0
So so whats your theory then about this	Well theres a  okay	0.0
Well theres a  okay	Theory is that player two player B has more of an advantage even though it is a game of luck	4.0
Theory is that player two player B has more of an advantage even though it is a game of luck	No way you could change it so it s not a game of luck	4.0
No way you could change it so it s not a game of luck	No matter what you do it s gonna be a game of luck	4.0
But if you wanted to win would you would you want to be player A or player B	I wanna be Player B	3.0
But that you re saying that doesnt guarantee you win	That does it s not a sure win	3.0
That does it s not a sure win	It doesn t guarantee it but it gives you a little more of a chance	3.0
I wonder	How much more how much	0.0
How much more how much	Oh	0.0
Oh	Thats the other thing	0.0
Thats the other thing	Um I played five games with my dad	0.0
OK	And the first game this is player B and this is player A	4.0
And the first game this is player B and this is player A	It was ten to nothing	4.0
It was ten to nothing	And the second game it was ten to three player B won	4.0
And the second game it was ten to three player B won	The third game it was nine to ten and Player A won	4.0
Oh really	The fourth the fourth game player B won ten to five	4.0
The fourth the fourth game player B won ten to five	And the fifth game player B won ten to six	4.0
Now does it surprise you that player A won one time here	Well it surprises well	0.0
But player A won one time out of five	Yeah player B A won	0.0
And when A lost the scores were far	I figured that if A was going to win the scores would be close because of the way the numbers are like together	4.0
I figured that if A was going to win the scores would be close because of the way the numbers are like together	But but when player B won the numbers were like split apart so it s weird	4.0
But but when player B won the numbers were like split apart so it s weird	You dont know it s like um just coincidence or you know	4.0
You dont know it s like um just coincidence or you know	It s like	0.0
OK	Its not	0.0
Im going to go listen to what Michelle is doing	Alright	0.0
Excuse me	Write with black and blue	0.0

Well actually this is what I m trying to say here	That player A two that means that they have one chance at hitting two one chance at hitting three two chances at hitting four two chances at hitting ten one chance at hitting eleven and one chance of hitting twelve	4.0
That player A two that means that they have one chance at hitting two one chance at hitting three two chances at hitting four two chances at hitting ten one chance at hitting eleven and one chance of hitting twelve	That equals eight	4.0

Even if even if you roll one	Yeah it does not matter	3.0
And then the other	That doesn t make a difference	3.0
That doesn t make a difference	You see see if you wanna roll one to see what you re gonna get like say you need a an eleven or whatever if you roll a four first or a three you don t  you re not gonna get it cause it s impossible	4.0
You see see if you wanna roll one to see what you re gonna get like say you need a an eleven or whatever if you roll a four first or a three you don t  you re not gonna get it cause it s impossible	So then you could realize it s not gonna win	4.0

Did you like the problem	Yes	0.0
Yes	We re gonna market the game	0.0
My my question is that did you change your mind about what you originally thought	Yes	0.0
But how many of you changed your mind about what you thought after you started playing it	I don t know	2.0
OK so tell me in what way that happened	Jeff and I thought that	0.0
Romina	Well Jeff and I thought that the game was pretty fair at first but then when we started playing we realized that player B had a little bit more of a an advantage	4.0
Well Jeff and I thought that the game was pretty fair at first but then when we started playing we realized that player B had a little bit more of a an advantage	We started to break it up more into the numbers than just playing the game	4.0
We started to break it up more into the numbers than just playing the game	And then we sorta got like we came to the we figured out when you go inside the numbers you find a lot more about	4.0
You want to tell	First we explain this	0.0
First we explain this	And then this	0.0
And then this	This is the new game this explains why	0.0
Did you change your mind	That s this is the basic	3.0
That s this is the basic	This is how we went inside the numbers	3.0
This is how we went inside the numbers	And those out of the sixteen fifteen times player B won	1.0
And those out of the sixteen fifteen times player B won	And player A only player A only won once	1.0
Yes	I thought win because it more	3.0
OK did you all hear what Mike said	No	0.0
Again Mike please	I thought A was gonna win cause it has more numbers than player B	4.0
I saw some of the papers some other people guessing A would win but I was wondering why	At first	3.0
You thought so too Michelle	I don t remember what I thought	0.0
I don t remember what I thought	Really but like it it make it s weird though because um player A could have two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and B can only have twelve but B could still has a chance to win	4.0
Really but like it it make it s weird though because um player A could have two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and B can only have twelve but B could still has a chance to win	And that s what s weird about it	4.0
And that s what s weird about it	Because like it s just it s however the luck is going	4.0
You thought about it before you played the game	I wouldn t need much skill at this game	3.0
I wouldn t need much skill at this game	You need skill	3.0
You need skill	This you just have to roll the dice	3.0
Brian	I just knew it wasn t fair	3.0
Which way did you think it was unfair though	I think that player B had an advantage	3.0
Why did you think that	Because just this is why this is what not first cause I didn t really think anything at first but then later like because player A they had like the first three beginning numbers and they re hard to get because like the only other like no combinations like one or two and they had the last three which only have like three and two	4.0
Because just this is why this is what not first cause I didn t really think anything at first but then later like because player A they had like the first three beginning numbers and they re hard to get because like the only other like no combinations like one or two and they had the last three which only have like three and two	And player B had like all the middle numbers and you re like more combinations	4.0
And player B had like all the middle numbers and you re like more combinations	So that s what I thought	0.0
Stepanie what did you think	I remembered hearing um I don t remember what I thought but I remembered hearing um a first thing and I think I saw this too	0.0
I remembered hearing um I don t remember what I thought but I remembered hearing um a first thing and I think I saw this too	That um um player A had had player A had six numbers	4.0
That um um player A had had player A had six numbers	Player A has more of an advantage	4.0
Player A has more of an advantage	And then when you got into it more that player B had the better numbers to roll because as you started playing and it s like wait a minute probably player B is winning	4.0
And then when you got into it more that player B had the better numbers to roll because as you started playing and it s like wait a minute probably player B is winning	And it was because player B had the like the better	4.0
And it was because player B had the like the better	Yeah the more chances of hitting it than player A	1.0
Yeah the more chances of hitting it than player A	Mhmm	1.0
Did you any any theory before you started playng	I thought that B would win cause they had like the middle numbers	4.0
Ankur	Like the same thing Brian said	1.0
Like the same thing Brian said	Cause B had the like the middle numbers and A only had like one and twelve and I mean like two and twelve	4.0
Cause B had the like the middle numbers and A only had like one and twelve and I mean like two and twelve	And they re not that commonly rolled	4.0
Did you have any ideas before you started	Like the same thing Brian said	1.0
What about you Matt what do you think	I th I thought it was the same way Steph said	1.0
I th I thought it was the same way Steph said	Like I thought in the beginning that you that player player A has more numbers than player B	4.0
Like I thought in the beginning that you that player player A has more numbers than player B	Player A  s gonna win but then player B is always winning	4.0
Magdalena	That I thought that player A is gonna win cause there s more numbers but player B won	4.0
You thought it was fair at first	Yeah	0.0
Now I wanna know you have a theory and now you think if you wanted to win the game who would you like to be	B	3.0
Amy	Um I think B has the advantage cause B has like the numbers that a lot dice game those kind of numbers that like twelve or eleven they didn t get seven or sixes	4.0
Um I think B has the advantage cause B has like the numbers that a lot dice game those kind of numbers that like twelve or eleven they didn t get seven or sixes	Or eights nines	4.0
Why is that	Uh because they have ah like they have different um pairs that can add up to the numbers	4.0
Uh because they have ah like they have different um pairs that can add up to the numbers	Like um six three and three or um four and two	4.0
Well three you can get how many ways	One	3.0
And what s that way	Two and one	3.0
And she can get six by	Two and four three and three	3.0
Two and four three and three	Five and one	3.0
Do you all agree with that	No	1.0
Ankur doesn t agree with you	We got a chart	0.0
OK Milin	I say I say from three there s two and one and one and two because two is on one die and two is on the other die and one is on the one die one is also on the other die	4.0
I say I say from three there s two and one and one and two because two is on one die and two is on the other die and one is on the one die one is also on the other die	Yeah but say you can just break the one down and say you can switch it	1.0
Yeah but say you can just break the one down and say you can switch it	We re not playing with the cards anymore	0.0

Can somebody tell me what the disagreement is	The	0.0
Can someone summarize what the disagreement is	The he s saying that you have one on one die and two on the other but you can also have two on one die and one on the other	1.0
The he s saying that you have one on one die and two on the other but you can also have two on one die and one on the other	But it s the same thing	1.0

Unfortunately he makes somewhat sense because actually you do have two chances of hittin  it	What	0.0
What	See look because if you roll if this die might show a one and this die might show a two but next time you roll it might be the other way around	4.0
See look because if you roll if this die might show a one and this die might show a two but next time you roll it might be the other way around	What Jeff	0.0

And that makes it two chances to hit that	Even though it s the same number it s two separate things on two different die	1.0
Even though it s the same number it s two separate things on two different die	There s more there s more of a chance	1.0

Jeff	Yeah because if it just seems like even even if you do switch you ll still be like the same thing	4.0
Yeah because if it just seems like even even if you do switch you ll still be like the same thing	Alright	0.0
Alright	Yeah but that s the same thing as that	1.0
Yeah but that s the same thing as that	No but this look on this one you have two and one	4.0
No but this look on this one you have two and one	But you actually have to move the die to hit one and two	4.0

Alright	That s good	0.0
That s good	Um for three you can get two times and I want to show you this graph because this ll show you how you can get it	1.0
Um for three you can get two times and I want to show you this graph because this ll show you how you can get it	Is It s hard to understand but it ll show you how you can get the number	0.0
Is It s hard to understand but it ll show you how you can get the number	Alright here	0.0
Alright here	One and one is two and there s only one way to get two	4.0
One and one is two and there s only one way to get two	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	So there s two ways to get three	1.0
So there s two ways to get three	Didn t we have this stuff in like second grade	0.0
Didn t we have this stuff in like second grade	And there s two threes up here because two and one is three and one and two is three	4.0
And there s two threes up here because two and one is three and one and two is three	There s three ways to get four	4.0
There s three ways to get four	Three and one and two and two and one and three	4.0
Three and one and two and two and one and three	And there s four ways to get five	4.0
And there s four ways to get five	Four and one um wait wait I mi messed up	4.0
Four and one um wait wait I mi messed up	OK four and one three and two two and three and one and four	4.0
OK four and one three and two two and three and one and four	And so on	4.0
And so on	And seven has the highest probability	4.0
And seven has the highest probability	That doesn t mean seven  s gonna come up a lot because I know I rolled I kept getting eights and Brian kept getting four and Amy kept rolling what she said	4.0
That doesn t mean seven  s gonna come up a lot because I know I rolled I kept getting eights and Brian kept getting four and Amy kept rolling what she said	You see what See you hand me the sheet uh this like the paper we worked on	0.0
You see what See you hand me the sheet uh this like the paper we worked on	Hand me it	0.0
Hand me it	So what happened is that this doesn t mean that your number  s gonna come up any time but seven does have the highest chance	1.0
So what happened is that this doesn t mean that your number  s gonna come up any time but seven does have the highest chance	And unfair in Angela s paper	1.0
And unfair in Angela s paper	Angela and Brian	0.0
Just pull it down a little bit	OK	0.0
OK	For some reason	0.0
More more	OK we ll just have to give player A oh this is Angela s idea on how to make it fair because player B has numbers that are m have more ways to come up so they re easier to get	4.0
OK we ll just have to give player A oh this is Angela s idea on how to make it fair because player B has numbers that are m have more ways to come up so they re easier to get	Maybe because it s a game of luck and it doesn t matter	4.0
Maybe because it s a game of luck and it doesn t matter	I it it helps but it really doesn t matter cause it s a game of luck	4.0
I it it helps but it really doesn t matter cause it s a game of luck	Angela said give player A numbers two through six	4.0
Angela said give player A numbers two through six	Give player B numbers eight through five	4.0

Numbers eight through twelve have the same kind of chances as two through six	If you roll seven then you lose a turn	4.0
If you roll seven then you lose a turn	Because seven has the most chances	4.0
Because seven has the most chances	It wouldn t be fair to give player A sev two to seven or player B seven to twelve because the player with seven would have the most chance of winning	4.0
It wouldn t be fair to give player A sev two to seven or player B seven to twelve because the player with seven would have the most chance of winning	This is a game of luck but I think it would be more fair	4.0
This is a game of luck but I think it would be more fair	And then she drew a little picture	4.0

Well I m not disagreeing it s just when she was talking about the sevens we we marked down we played five games and we marked down out of four of those games like sevens the first time we didn t realize it but cause we had when we when you hit the seven we figured we d just be like roll again	So the first time the first game when we we had no sevens in our first game second game we had six the third game we had four and the fourth game we had one	4.0
So the first time the first game when we we had no sevens in our first game second game we had six the third game we had four and the fourth game we had one	So we really like it doesn t mean j it just has a higher chance hitting it it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	4.0
So we really like it doesn t mean j it just has a higher chance hitting it it doesn t mean it s gonna come out	Mhmm	1.0

That the question I I I raised um I guess um I asked you to think about is if you rolled if you took the two dice and you shook them well an you rolled them both and I asked you that question before	Yeah	0.0
Or if you rolled one and then another does it matter	No	0.0
No	No it s just you see but say it was tied up and you needed a like an eleven to win if you rolled your first die and it came out one there s no way you re getting a ten on this one	4.0
No it s just you see but say it was tied up and you needed a like an eleven to win if you rolled your first die and it came out one there s no way you re getting a ten on this one	So you could you j know you re gonna lose if you go like the you have you have like if you roll a five then you know you have a chance	4.0

OK something to say about that Brian	Well see if you re rolling with two this could happen sometimes	4.0
Well see if you re rolling with two this could happen sometimes	But it doesn t happen like most of the time	4.0
But it doesn t happen like most of the time	Like you could be rolling with two and when they hit the ground they could like hit each other and they could just go flying off it and then but if you roll it with one and you ll roll it with the other it s not going to hit each other	4.0

Cause	what it shows is that there s like six numbers on the die and like twelve numbers between both	3.0
what it shows is that there s like six numbers on the die and like twelve numbers between both	Yeah so it s like just like	1.0
Yeah so it s like just like	Alright the really really really really simple way to do it this	0.0
Alright the really really really really simple way to do it this	Six numbers on one die six numbers on the other die	1.0
Bring it down some	They can t see that	0.0
They can t see that	There s six numbers on one die and there s six numbers on the other die and you multiply them together and get thirty six	4.0
There s six numbers on one die and there s six numbers on the other die and you multiply them together and get thirty six	Six times six is six	4.0
Six times six is six	We re advanced	0.0
What do the numbers on the sides represent	Uh on these sides	0.0
Let s take in the first column what do those numbers represent	Right here right here right here	0.0
Yeah	They re numbers on	0.0
They re numbers on	These are numbers one of the dice and these are the numbers on the other die	3.0
What do the numbers in in the body of the table mean	Uh what the what like the one and one	0.0
Uh what the what like the one and one	Equal	3.0
Equal	OK so equals two	1.0
OK so equals two	Two	1.0
Yeah	Is you can get two one way	4.0
Is you can get two one way	One and one	4.0
One and one	and one	1.0
and one	Now you can get three two ways	1.0
Now you can get three two ways	You can get three two ways	1.0
You can get three two ways	Which is like two and	1.0
Which is like two and	Two and one	1.0
Two and one	one	1.0
one	That equals three	1.0
That equals three	And	0.0
And	and	0.0
and	one and two that	1.0
How do you know but	Shows how many times you can get each number	3.0
I don t understand what the	The number in the chart shows you the number that you get	3.0
How do you get it	Alright	0.0
Alright	See the number that s placed under one of the numbers and next to the other number	3.0
See the number that s placed under one of the numbers and next to the other number	So it like two and one is three	3.0
So what are you doing to get the three	Adding	3.0
You re adding the two and the one	Yeah	0.0
The numbers inside are the sums	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
The numbers on the outsides are what you roll on each of the die	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	See	0.0
So one would be go ahead Jeff	Well like like how it says that there s one two three four five six sevens that means there s six different possible ways to get it	3.0
You mean the sum of seven	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	This is this is really sloppy	0.0
This is this is really sloppy	The other one I made was neat and you	0.0
The other one I made was neat and you	Does everybody remember those like little charts we used to get in second grade	0.0
Does everybody remember those like little charts we used to get in second grade	Yeah ye and you	0.0
Yeah ye and you	One times one is one	0.0
One times one is one	Except this is like adding one and one is two	0.0
Except this is like adding one and one is two	Yeah it s like	0.0
Yeah it s like	That taught us how to add just kind of you know	0.0
That taught us how to add just kind of you know	inside the trapper keepers they have it	0.0
inside the trapper keepers they have it	The ones you used to cheat off of and	0.0
The ones that you cheat off of	Yeah	0.0
So how many outcomes are there if you re rolling two die	Thirty six	3.0
Thirty six	Thirty six	1.0
And you can count them	And you can prove it by counting these	3.0
And you can prove it by counting these	One two three four five six	0.0
One two three four five six	One two three four five six	0.0
One two three four five six	Six six six six	1.0
Would it matter	No	0.0
No	As long as it has the same number of	3.0
The same numbers	If one dies has one through six on it and the red die should have one through six on it	4.0
OK	If it has	0.0
If it has	And then the combinations are the same	3.0
Thank you very much that s	You re welcome	0.0
I know you re getting tired let s just listen to Milin	You can keep us  til two twenty two	0.0
You can keep us  til two twenty two	Oh my god Stephanie Bill has pupils	0.0

Oh no	Bill has	0.0
And then we have one final question Jeff	I got this from both of Stephanie s charts	1.0
I got this from both of Stephanie s charts	Cause it s like one of the was like the triangle thing and the other one was the other way	0.0
Cause it s like one of the was like the triangle thing and the other one was the other way	This shows kind of you could get and I did this basically show both	0.0
Tell us what they each represent	OK	0.0
OK	Like for the for the to get two there s there s only one way and that s one and one	4.0
Like for the for the to get two there s there s only one way and that s one and one	To get three there s one and two and two and one	4.0
To get three there s one and two and two and one	To get four there s two and two one and three and three and one	4.0
To get four there s two and two one and three and three and one	To get five there s one and four four and one three and two and two and three	4.0
To get five there s one and four four and one three and two and two and three	For six there s three and three two and four four and two one and five and five and one	4.0
How is that different that Stephanie s chart	Well	0.0
Remember Stephanie s chart up here	Is it	0.0
How is Milin s chart different than	Well he did it off of this chart	1.0
Well he did it off of this chart	Yeah he sorta did he used those numbers on his chart	1.0
Yeah he sorta did he used those numbers on his chart	He just like turned turned and then	1.0
He just like turned turned and then	Wrote the numbers into the square	1.0
Wrote the numbers into the square	Yeah he like mixed them	1.0
Yeah he like mixed them	He wrote the numbers in the blank in the squares	1.0
He wrote the numbers in the blank in the squares	He put them in a blank	1.0
Oh in the squares the numbers went in Stephanie s squares	Instead of like the shaded where the shaded he wrote the numbers in	1.0
So so	Basically the same	1.0
Did you have a	That one	1.0
That one	I think his i I think Milin s is is	1.0
I think his i I think Milin s is is	Shows all the numbers	1.0
Shows all the numbers	Because you see	0.0
You like to see all the numbers	Matt I was sort of confused but Stephanie you needed two charts to it  understand what she was saying and Mil Milin	1.0
Matt I was sort of confused but Stephanie you needed two charts to it  understand what she was saying and Mil Milin	One chart does it all	1.0
One chart does it all	Milin	0.0
Milin	Milin sort of took both and put it in with a little bit of  and mixed it up and took it out and he got that	1.0
Milin sort of took both and put it in with a little bit of  and mixed it up and took it out and he got that	He summed it up	1.0
I have one final question are you ready	What is mathematics	0.0
One final question	What is mathematics	0.0
Jeff	Can we  we never had play like  carry on please	0.0
Can we  we never had play like  carry on please	We don t have to go until two twenty two	0.0
We d love to take you with us	Oh	0.0
We have three dice here	What do you teach	0.0
What do you teach	Like what class do you teach	0.0
OK	Math	0.0
Math	They teach science	0.0
They teach science	Maybe my brother has them	0.0
I have three dice	Mhmm	0.0
Mhmm	OK	0.0
OK	Can you tell me can you tell me	0.0
Can you tell me can you tell me	how it goes	0.0
and again I m interested in ah I m rolling three	Yeah	0.0
Can you get in  imagine in your head the possible How many possible outcomes are there if you re rolling three	Six times six times six	3.0
Six times six times six	Two hundred and sixty two	1.0
Two hundred and sixty two	Well the obvious thing is b how we usually do it	0.0
Well the obvious thing is b how we usually do it	Six times six	3.0
Six times six	That would be six times six times six	1.0
That would be six times six times six	Times six	1.0
Times six	But actually it would turn out to be something different cause we re just jumping to a conclusion	1.0
But actually it would turn out to be something different cause we re just jumping to a conclusion	No	1.0
No	And you re	0.0
And you re	How would you know Ankur	2.0
We want to hear that	How can you be positive	2.0
Yeah	Twenty one	3.0
Not only do I want to know how	Two hundred sixteen	3.0
If you had one chance to roll the dice and everything was on it what number would you choose	Seven	3.0
What	Seven	3.0
Suppose you re rolling three what is the one number	Nothing	0.0
Do you want us to come back	Yeah come back	0.0
Yeah come back	How about tomorrow	0.0
How about tomorrow	OK look	0.0
Is this a good thing to do	Yeah	0.0
And you want to come to Rutgers some time	Yeah	0.0
This has been great fun	Brian	0.0
Brian	Million dollar roll	0.0
You were just great	Seven	0.0
Seven	He said you lost number seven	0.0
Talk about the next one and write up why you it	OK	0.0
OK	I could stay there the whole time	0.0
And the game that were going to  play is called	Guess my rule	0.0
Guess my rule	He told you that you were going to play the game or that you had  worked on that game already	0.0
He told you which	That we were going to play Guess My Rule	0.0
So uh the game goes as follows I am going to  think in my mind of some rule	And then you got to guess it	0.0
Youre going to try and guess it but do you know how youre  going to try and guess the rule	Yea were going to be working with numbers	0.0
My rule takes the number	You cant tell us what the rule is	0.0
Okay	Oh	0.0
Thirteen	Is it Oh I know what to do	0.0
Hold on	He just added eight	3.0
He just added eight	Just add the eight	1.0
Dont Dont say what you think the rule is	Then how are we supposed to know	0.0
So the first number was what	Five and then	3.0
And it gave you	Thirteen	3.0
Alright but I dont  want you to try and guess the rule just yet	Three	3.0
Three	Three	3.0
Three	Three	3.0
So Dawud said three and my number my what do you think  my number is going to do to three	Its going to make it into eleven	3.0
Nope my rule takes  the number three and makes it seven	So how do you get thirteen from the five	3.0
So how do you get thirteen from the five	Oh I get it	0.0
Well you have to guess my rule	I get it	0.0
But like for every	I know your rule	0.0
Okay so what are the two results we have so far	Alright five and thirteen	3.0
So you can mention another  number and Ill tell you	I know they both theyre both higher	3.0
I know they both theyre both higher	Six	3.0
Okay Dawud said What number did Dawud just say	Six	3.0
Six	Wait I want to say a number he said one	0.0
Wait I want to say a number he said one	Can I say four	0.0
Can I say four	Dont say a number guess the rule	0.0
What do you  think my rule is going to do to six	I know	0.0
I know	Look Look Look	0.0
Look Look Look	When you had	0.0
Tell me what you think if we have six what do you think is  going to happen to six	Its going to go six to twentyfour	3.0
Does everyone agree	I think six is going to go to ten	3.0
You think six is going to go to ten	Cause look	0.0
Cause look	We made five we made five with eight we made  seven with four	4.0
We made five we made five with eight we made  seven with four	So six it will be twentyfour	4.0
So six it will be twentyfour	Mmhmm	1.0
Mmhmm	Mmhmm	1.0
Does anyone else have a guess	I say ten I say ten	3.0
I say ten I say ten	Its going to be twentyfour then thirtysix	3.0
Why does  he think that	Fifteen	3.0
Fifteen	Cause cause the first one is five and like I think that you keep on  adding on cause the number Like three you added it on four  for five its matching the five you added on eight	4.0
Cause cause the first one is five and like I think that you keep on  adding on cause the number Like three you added it on four  for five its matching the five you added on eight	It depends on  the number thats how much you add on	4.0
It depends on  the number thats how much you add on	Its eight	3.0
Its eight	Its going to be eight	3.0
Im going to write down the  number	I knew it was ten	0.0
I knew it was ten	What are you talking about  its ten	4.0
What are you talking about  its ten	Look cause 5 was at an eight then you added two more and for  like number 3 it was four	4.0
Look cause 5 was at an eight then you added two more and for  like number 3 it was four	And if it was four you would add a  six	4.0
And if it was four you would add a  six	And for five you would add eight	4.0
He says that any number I put in this column you do  what Ariel	Well like it would depending on that number you would add  two on to what you did to the last one right	4.0
Well like it would depending on that number you would add  two on to what you did to the last one right	Like cause five you  added eight and for six you added ten	4.0
Like cause five you  added eight and for six you added ten	So and for three you  added four	4.0
So and for three you  added four	Wait yea four	4.0
Wait yea four	So it would be eight then four then  ten	4.0
So it would be eight then four then  ten	So like five is just one number lower than six and it was  eight	4.0
So like five is just one number lower than six and it was  eight	And since the six is ten so I figured it would go by each  number add two	4.0
James would you like to pick a number to try	Eight	0.0
What number do you think my rule is  going to give back for eight	Eight	0.0
Eight	Umm	0.0
Umm	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Eighteen	3.0
Eighteen	Nah	1.0
Look at all the numbers	Could I see that paper	0.0
Ill hold on to this	Oh I got it I know I got it	0.0
Oh I got it I know I got it	Its twentytwo	3.0
Its twentytwo	Eighteen	1.0
Eighteen	Twentytwo	1.0
Twentytwo	Twentytwo	1.0
Twentytwo	How did you get twentytwo Ariel	2.0
How did you get twentytwo Ariel	Add two	3.0
Add two	What you talking about  add two	2.0
What you talking about  add two	Oh I found a dollar	0.0
Oh I found a dollar	It would be funny if I got nine	0.0
It would be funny if I got nine	No its seventeen	3.0
No its seventeen	It would be funny if you were wrong	0.0
It would be funny if you were wrong	I think its twentytwo	3.0
Okay can everyone see what Im writing	I know like a way to represent it too	0.0
I know like a way to represent it too	Like the square is the  numbers going in like the triangle it goes into like a say a  factory and it comes out the triangle number	4.0
Id like everyone to  hear what Ariel just said	Let Ariel talk	0.0
Okay Ariel go ahead	Alright so like the square could be the number youre putting in  and it can say like it can go to like the factory or something like  that and it come out the number in the triangle triangle number	4.0
Alright so like the square could be the number youre putting in  and it can say like it can go to like the factory or something like  that and it come out the number in the triangle triangle number	Square number and triangle number	4.0
Okay so did you hear what Ariel said	Yup hes mad smart	0.0
Yup hes mad smart	No he talks too fast	0.0
Dawud could you tell us what Ariel said	Umm I didnt hear him	0.0
Umm I didnt hear him	He talks too fast	0.0
He talks too fast	Can you repeat that again please	0.0
Can you repeat that again please	Can you repeat that	0.0
Can you repeat that	The square could be like a type a number and then when it goes  into say like a factory or something like that	4.0
The square could be like a type a number and then when it goes  into say like a factory or something like that	It would come out  the triangle type of number	4.0
It would come out  the triangle type of number	So square is a number and triangle is a factor	1.0
So square is a number and triangle is a factor	Is that what you  trying to say	1.0
Is that what you  trying to say	Look look	0.0
Look look	Its like the square is like the bigger kind of shape  and then the like triangle goes into the square to make	4.0
Its like the square is like the bigger kind of shape  and then the like triangle goes into the square to make	It keep on multiplying by four	4.0
Is that what you think	Look thats eight four then twelve	4.0
Look thats eight four then twelve	So thats eight four  twelve	4.0
So thats eight four  twelve	You mean adding	1.0
You mean adding	You mean adding	1.0
You mean adding	You mean factors of four	1.0
You mean factors of four	Yea	0.0
Yea	No its not	1.0
No its not	He means factors of four	1.0
Alright here goes the number	So thats thats going to be eighteen	3.0
So thats thats going to be eighteen	No its going to add up by  eighteen	3.0
No its going to add up by  eighteen	No its going to be sixteen	3.0
No its going to be sixteen	Look at the five look at the five	1.0
Look at the five look at the five	Its twentytwo	3.0

Oh I know whats next	Youre just youre just putting a five at  the end of each number	1.0
Youre just youre just putting a five at  the end of each number	No its fourteen then its thirteen then its twelve	3.0
No its fourteen then its thirteen then its twelve	Its fourteen then its twelve	4.0
Its fourteen then its twelve	I mean two to twentytwo then  its	4.0
I mean two to twentytwo then  its	I know the rule	0.0
I know the rule	I know the rule now	0.0
I know the rule now	Its by five	4.0
Think of a rule that will  produce what you think the number for four  okay	Its by five	4.0

I know the rule	The rule is like basically you got the same  thing	4.0
The rule is like basically you got the same  thing	You get you doing the same numbers like 11 22 33 and  you just adding five to the same numbers	4.0
You get you doing the same numbers like 11 22 33 and  you just adding five to the same numbers	You put forty I think  the next number you going to put is fortyfive	4.0
You put forty I think  the next number you going to put is fortyfive	Yes	1.0
Yes	See	0.0
See	Exactly Im too smart	0.0
Okay but the his rule One one second hang on	Oh snap	0.0
Oh snap	I get itYea I know the rule now	0.0
You got to think what is the operation that he is using to  get the number	Hes just putting a five at the end of the number	4.0
Hes just putting a five at the end of the number	I know basically you put a five at the end of each number	1.0
I know basically you put a five at the end of each number	Times ten	4.0
Times ten	Times ten	1.0
Okay so does that work	Times ten	4.0
Times ten	Thats half of it	3.0
Thats half of it	Times five	4.0
Does that work	Times ten divided by five	4.0
Times ten divided by five	Times ten divided by five	1.0
Times ten divided by five	No	1.0
No	Times ten times ten times five	4.0
See whether or not your rule see whether it  works	Times ten plus five	4.0
Times ten plus five	No	1.0
No	Yea bud yea	1.0
Yea bud yea	Give me that marker	0.0
Give me that marker	Times ten what	2.0
Yup did he get it	Yea	1.0
Yea	Times ten what	2.0
Times ten what	Plus five	3.0
What what	Yea	0.0
Tell him what tell them what the rule was	Times ten plus five	0.0
Times ten plus five	That was easy	0.0
That was easy	Its five ten	4.0
Its five ten	Its times ten plus five	0.0
Its times ten plus five	Oh that was easy	0.0
Oh that was easy	I should have know that	0.0
Okay lets see if you get them	I say whoever is talking  hes just stalling yo	0.0
I say whoever is talking  hes just stalling yo	Oh I want to do one more	0.0
Do you want to fill out the chart	Alright alright	0.0
Alright alright	Lets go Chris	0.0
Lets go Chris	Lets go Chris	0.0

Ooooooo	Times two times two	4.0
Times two times two	I said that when they had the ten	4.0
I said that when they had the ten	Hahahaha what is that	2.0
Hahahaha what is that	Thats twelve	3.0
Thats twelve	Why you switch it up man	0.0
Why you switch it up man	Oh I know it anyways	0.0
Oh I know it anyways	What is it	2.0
What is it	Plus ten	4.0
Plus ten	Plus ten	4.0
And  then well hand it out to you on paper okay	I just noticed one plus one is two So you couldnt get that so I thought  about one times two and that will be two and then add one and thats  three	4.0
Do you want another  problem	Whatever	0.0
Lets try this one	Five plus two	3.0
Five plus two	Oh this is easy	0.0
Oh this is easy	Its the same thing just  wait a minute  yeah it is the same thing no no its not yeah yeah	3.0
Its the same thing just  wait a minute  yeah it is the same thing no no its not yeah yeah	Its the same thing	3.0
What do you mean by same thing	Its zero times two plus five is five	4.0
Its zero times two plus five is five	Zero times two plus five is five	4.0
Zero times two plus five is five	One times two is two plus five is is  seven	4.0
One times two is two plus five is is  seven	Then two times two wait a minute I mean two plus seven	4.0
Then two times two wait a minute I mean two plus seven	Three times five is eight I mean fifteen three times five is fifteen	4.0
Three times five is eight I mean fifteen three times five is fifteen	I didnt say five I said plus five	1.0
I didnt say five I said plus five	Its times two	3.0
Its times two	Plus five	1.0
Plus five	Three times two is six	4.0
Three times two is six	So one times two is two plus five is seven and then two times two is four  plus five is nine three times three is six I mean three times two two  two two  let me  write	4.0
So one times two is two plus five is seven and then two times two is four  plus five is nine three times three is six I mean three times two two  two two  let me  write	Times two plus five	4.0
Times two plus five	I got this big O mark	0.0
I got this big O mark	Zero times two plus five equals five	4.0
Zero times two plus five equals five	And then look one times  two is two and two plus five is seven	4.0
And then look one times  two is two and two plus five is seven	Then two times two is four and  plus five is nine	4.0
Then two times two is four and  plus five is nine	Three times three times two two two is six plus five  is eleven then four times two is eight plus five is thirteen	4.0
Three times three times two two two is six plus five  is eleven then four times two is eight plus five is thirteen	This is easy	0.0
This is easy	Done	0.0
Done	Next	0.0
How do you compare the first one and the second one when you  were telling me it is the same thing	Because it is both times two	4.0
Because it is both times two	You are just  changing the adding	4.0
You are just  changing the adding	Next	0.0
Next	Times something plus something	0.0
Times something plus something	Now we can take a break	0.0
Or do you  think that is the only rule we can get	Thats the only one we can get	0.0
Thats the only one we can get	Times no times four plus no	3.0
Times no times four plus no	Oh I see a pattern	0.0
Oh I see a pattern	I cant even do that its too hard	0.0
I cant even do that its too hard	I see a pattern  though	0.0
I see a pattern  though	It is going to be straight up	3.0
It is going to be straight up	Im done	0.0
Im done	Ohhhh	0.0
Ohhhh	I see it	0.0
I see it	Its add by five Zero plus five	4.0
Its add by five Zero plus five	No first is five you add  five right here	4.0
No first is five you add  five right here	Then you add six then you add seven then you add  eight then nine and then right here you add twentyfive thirty	4.0
Then you add six then you add seven then you add  eight then nine and then right here you add twentyfive thirty	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	How are we doing this again	2.0
How are we doing this again	0310	0.0
So explain to me what you are doing here	Because zero plus five is five and then one plus six is seven and then  two plus seven is nine then three plus eight is eleven and four plus nine  is thirteen	4.0
And what about for twentyfive	And then twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	4.0
Why thirty	Because twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	4.0
Because twentyfive plus thirty is fiftyfive	Well I just put that because  you asked me whats twentyfive plus	4.0
I was just curious to see because I see here you said Im going to add  five here then Im going to add six here then Im going to add seven      here how you know when you get down to twentyfive you are going to  add thirty there	Ten eleven twelve then thirteen and then fourteen and then fifteen   and then for twentyfive	4.0
What if I wanted to know the value for eightytwo	You mean we can write eightytwo right here	0.0
Hmm hmm	Then you will try to	0.0
Do you want to explain to  him what you have found	No I dont remember	0.0
OK then how about if I ask you for eightytwo X is eightytwo	X is eightytwo	0.0
X is eightytwo	And then you would just	0.0
And then you would just	Oh X is eightytwo	0.0
Oh X is eightytwo	You said that that was eightytwo	0.0
You said that that was eightytwo	Oh thats easy	0.0
If X was eightytwo	You would add um zero X oh eightytwo	4.0
You would add um zero X oh eightytwo	Its One hundred and sixty four and then you gotta add five so  one hundred  and sixtynine	4.0
OK so what did you use to get this number	Multiply eightytwo by two and then add five to the answer and then I  get one hundred and sixty nine	4.0
OK so this was using this equation	Yeah	0.0
Ok and then you told me you found another way of finding the  numbers	Yeah and then you notice that eightytwo plus	3.0
Can you explain to T2 what you have found here	Oh for like every number you add another one for like zero is five since  youre going to one now you add another is six going to two you add      another is seven going to three you add another is eight going to four  you add another is nine	4.0
And so how would you express that rule	Huh	0.0
Huh	Well the first rule that we came up with was times two plus five	4.0
Well the first rule that we came up with was times two plus five	Because zero times two plus five is five	4.0
Because zero times two plus five is five	One times two is two plus five  is seven and then we can up with	4.0
Does it work for the others	Yeah it worked for all of them and then we came up with this one	3.0
Can you show me	Zero times two plus five equals five	4.0
Zero times two plus five equals five	One times two plus five equals seven	4.0
One times two plus five equals seven	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	Yeah yeah	0.0
Yeah yeah	Two times two plus five equals nine	4.0
Two times two plus five equals nine	Then its three times two plus five equals eleven	4.0
Then its three times two plus five equals eleven	And the pattern is five plus two is seven plus two is nine plus two is  eleven plus two is thirteen	4.0
Do you and James agree on that	Yeah	1.0
Have you guys talked about it	Yeah	0.0
OK would you like another challenge	OKWe have already done two	0.0
See what you think of this one	Its adding by all odd numbers	4.0
Tell me what you mean by its add by odd numbers	Zero plus one is one plus three is four	4.0
Zero plus one is one plus three is four	This plus five is seven Yeah  and then three plus seven is ten	4.0
If I give you four for X	Thirteen	3.0
What if I gave you six for X	Six	0.0
Hmm hmm	Then I know for five it would be eleven and then six would be thirteen  so it would be nineteen	4.0
What if I gave you my favorite number twentyfive again for X	Oh twentyfive	0.0
Hmm hmm	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	See you be giving me hard  stuff	0.0
Im trying to challenge you	I dont want to	0.0
OK so what you think we can do	Oh fiftyfive	3.0
Can you explain me this	I already figured this one out	0.0
But can you first explain me this what you got and then you can tell me  that one	Oh I found that I was  like I came up with the first rule we got was times two plus five zero  times two plus five is five one times two plus five is seven and so on  and so on and then we came up with	4.0
How you got this	One plus six	0.0
One plus six	Oh that is for this rule	0.0
Oh that is for this rule	The other rule that I came up with that James  came up with was that you add for every like number you add on one to  add to the number	4.0
The other rule that I came up with that James  came up with was that you add for every like number you add on one to  add to the number	So for zero youre adding five that equals five	4.0
So for zero youre adding five that equals five	For      one you add on one and it equals six so one plus six is seven	4.0
Hmm hmm	Then for the two it would be plus seven is nine	4.0
Hmm hmm	Three plus eight is eleven four plus nine is thirteen and five plus ten is  fifteen	4.0
Three plus eight is eleven four plus nine is thirteen and five plus ten is  fifteen	And the pattern I also see is that it keeps on adding two we have  five plus two is seven seven plus two is nine plus two is eleven plus  two is thirteen plus two is fifteen	4.0
OK then what is this here	And here it continues six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and  here it will continue fifteen plus two seventeen plus two is nineteen  plus two is twentyone plus two is twentythree plus two is twentyfive  plus two is twentyseven plus two is twentynine	4.0
And how you figure out this rule	This one	0.0
This one	Its easy	0.0
Its easy	This is times   Oh  man I forgot	0.0
This is times   Oh  man I forgot	Oh yeah times three plus one	3.0
Oh yeah times three plus one	Times three plus one	3.0
Times three plus one	Done	0.0
Done	Because 0 times 3 plus 1 equals 1	4.0
Because 0 times 3 plus 1 equals 1	And 1  times 3 is 3 plus 1 is 4	4.0
And 1  times 3 is 3 plus 1 is 4	2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7	4.0
2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7	And 3 times 3 is 9 plus  1 is 10	4.0
What will you get for four	Huh	0.0
What you will get for four	Four	0.0
Four	Thats easy	0.0
Thats easy	I got to add the odd number	4.0
I got to add the odd number	Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	4.0
Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	Its just adding three	1.0
Its just adding three	You find the answer easily	0.0
You find the answer easily	1 plus 3 is  4	4.0
1 plus 3 is  4	4 plus 3 is 7	4.0
4 plus 3 is 7	7 plus 3 is 10	4.0
7 plus 3 is 10	You just keep on adding three and you get  all of your answers	4.0
You just keep on adding three and you get  all of your answers	I got to add the odd number	4.0
I got to add the odd number	Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	4.0
Because you know zero plus one zero  plus one is one	One plus three is	4.0
One plus three is	Its just adding three	4.0
Its just adding three	You find the answer easily	4.0
You find the answer easily	1 plus 3 is 4	4.0
1 plus 3 is 4	4 plus 3  is 7	4.0
4 plus 3  is 7	7 plus 3 is 10	4.0
7 plus 3 is 10	You just keep on adding three and you get all of your  answers	4.0
I want to see if it is the same	I just got one thing	0.0
Ariel	Seventy six	3.0
Seventy six	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Seventysix for what	2.0
Seventysix for what	For whats the name what was the one again	2.0
Twentyfive	Yeah twentyfive	0.0
How you got seventysix	Its not no seventysix its eighty	3.0
Its not no seventysix its eighty	First ten times two  the thing of it is thirty  so then it would be 30  times 2 is 60 then 5 is 16 plus 16 is 76	4.0
First ten times two  the thing of it is thirty  so then it would be 30  times 2 is 60 then 5 is 16 plus 16 is 76	Ten plus five is fifteen	4.0
Ten plus five is fifteen	What happened	2.0
What happened	Ten plus five is fifteen	4.0
Ten plus five is fifteen	What happened	2.0
What happened	Ten plus five is fifteen	4.0
Ten plus five is fifteen	OK	0.0
Why did you do times two can you tell me	Oh because she said twentyfive so the thing for ten is thirty and ten  times two is twenty so thirty times two is sixty that will be twenty and  then for the five is sixteen	4.0
Oh because she said twentyfive so the thing for ten is thirty and ten  times two is twenty so thirty times two is sixty that will be twenty and  then for the five is sixteen	What	0.0
What	This is what I got	0.0
This is what I got	I got eighty	3.0
I got eighty	Five times five is twenty five	4.0
Five times five is twenty five	Five times eleven is fiftyfive	4.0
Five times eleven is fiftyfive	Five times sixteen is eighty because  I just found that out	4.0
Five times sixteen is eighty because  I just found that out	So I got eighty	4.0
So I got eighty	Ten times eight is eighty	4.0
Ten times eight is eighty	Huh	0.0
Huh	and then thirty times eight is	3.0
and then thirty times eight is	Two hundred and forty	1.0
Two hundred and forty	Seventyfive	3.0
Seventyfive	Seventyfive	3.0
If X equals twentyfive then  what does Y equal	Huh	0.0
If X equals twentyfive so Y equals	Seventyfive	3.0
And James you said when X equals twentyfive what does Y  equal	Huh	0.0
When X equals twentyfive what is Y equal	Eighty	3.0
So what  do you guys think	Oh wait a minute	0.0
Oh wait a minute	It is seventysix	4.0
It is seventysix	If you follow  my rule  twentyfive times    oh wait a minute  so I must have  messed up somewhere because twentyfive times three is seventyfive  plus one is seventysix like I got up here	4.0
What do you think James	I got eighty	3.0
I got eighty	I dont see how he got it	2.0
I dont see how he got it	Well Im going to go by my rule	3.0
Well Im going to go by my rule	Just do the rule on the number	0.0
Just do the rule on the number	Twentyfive times three plus one   but  wait a minute	3.0
Twentyfive times three plus one   but  wait a minute	Do you even have the same rule as me	2.0
Do you even have the same rule as me	Exactly	0.0
Exactly	You have a different rule	1.0
You have a different rule	Thats why	0.0
Thats why	But my rule worked	3.0
But my rule worked	Twentyfive	3.0
Twentyfive	Like this one had two different rules	4.0
Like this one had two different rules	It could have  more than one rule	4.0
It could have  more than one rule	Seventysix	3.0
Seventysix	SeventysixYeahhh	1.0
So I want you to explain to  each other whats your rule  and whats your rule	Mine is times three plus one	3.0
And you explain what your rule is	Mine is every number odd add in order like plus one plus three plus  five	3.0
What are you adding that plus one plus three plus five to	To X	0.0
To X	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	What do you say	0.0
What do you say	I start off with one then add the next  number by three then add the next number by five then seven then  nine add odd number in that order	4.0
Does that make sense to you	Yeah	1.0
OK so what if I gave you eightyfour for X	Huh	0.0
What if I gave you eightyfour for X	Lets see	0.0
Lets see	I got that on lock down	0.0
I got that on lock down	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	You said eightyfour right	0.0
You said eightyfour right	Thats easy	0.0
Thats easy	Two fifty three	3.0
What do you think	Two fifty three for what	2.0
Two fifty three for what	I used my rule	3.0
I used my rule	Eightyfour	3.0
Eightyfour	I just used my rule	3.0
I just used my rule	Eightyfour times three is two hundred and fiftytwo  plus one is two hundred and fiftythree	4.0
What do you think	Eightyfour	0.0
Eightyfour	Why eightyfour	2.0
I picked up any number	Stop giving us these big numbers	0.0
Stop giving us these big numbers	What if I give a thousand two hundred and fifty	3.0
A thousand two hundred and fifty	I dont	0.0
I dont	I dont want to do that	0.0
I dont want to do that	I dont want to do  that	0.0
I dont want to do  that	Three thousand seven hundred and fiftyone	3.0
My goodness what do you think about this James	What	0.0
What	One two fifty times three is three seven fifty plus one is three seven fifty  one	4.0
One two fifty times three is three seven fifty plus one is three seven fifty  one	I know that there is some pattern  between this one and this one	4.0
I know that there is some pattern  between this one and this one	I  dont know how to say it	0.0
Between which one and which one	I know twentyfive times three is seventyfive there is something out  there I just dont know how to explain it	3.0
What about twentyfive	It is seventysix	3.0
It is seventysix	I forgot to write down	0.0
Alright so what are you noticing with the numbers	Huh	0.0
What are you noticing with the numbers	I just noticed that twentyfive times three is seventyfive thats how I  solved this real quick	4.0
Do you think there is anything that is same with what you are doing and  what James came up with	Uh uh ahhh I dont know	0.0
Uh uh ahhh I dont know	Oh wait a minute	0.0
Oh wait a minute	Uh hmm maybe	0.0
Uh hmm maybe	I dont  know	0.0
I dont  know	Because Im adding three thats an odd number he is adding odd  numbers so might be the same	4.0
So might be the same	Im doing odd and he is doing odds so    same thing	4.0
So odd numbers are the common	Have you guys got more problems	0.0
would you like to make up your own so  that maybe we could give it to the rest of the class	There you go	0.0
How many rules did you guys do	Three	0.0
James Ariel is writing this number three can  you write the other	He has written  the following table on paper      X Y      0   9      1 12      2 15      3 18      4 21      5 24	0.0
He has written  the following table on paper      X Y      0   9      1 12      2 15      3 18      4 21      5 24	Can you find out this  rule	0.0
Can you find out this  rule	Guess my rule	0.0
Guess my rule	I will get it	0.0
I will get it	Thats a nine	0.0
Thats a nine	Huh	0.0
Huh	Thats a nine	0.0
Thats a nine	Yeah right here	0.0
Yeah right here	This is pretty easy	0.0
This is pretty easy	Got it	0.0
Got it	What is it	0.0
What is it	It is times two    no it is times three plus six	4.0
It is times two    no it is times three plus six	What this	0.0
What this	I  have written what I did yesterday	0.0
I  have written what I did yesterday	Are we supposed to write all the  rules	0.0
How you got this	Four times three is twelve	4.0
Four times	Three	3.0
What is that	Four	3.0
OK then	Plus one is thirteen	4.0
How did you get this	Six times three is eighteen plus one is nineteen	4.0
Can you explain me this	Huh what	0.0
Huh what	This one	0.0
Yeah	Oh seven   oh I messed up	3.0
Oh seven   oh I messed up	No wonder thats why	0.0
No wonder thats why	Yeah I messed  up	3.0
Yeah I messed  up	This is twentytwo	3.0
This is twentytwo	And this is supposed to be twentyfive	3.0
And this is supposed to be twentyfive	Wait a minute	0.0
Wait a minute	Yeah that is  supposed to be twentyfive	0.0
So whats the rule for this  one	About the rule	0.0
Hmm hmm	X you plus three and then times	3.0
Can you show if that works for these values	I want to write down	0.0
Yeah you can use one of that	Zero plus three is three times three is nine	4.0
Zero plus three is three times three is nine	One plus three is four times three is twelve	4.0
One plus three is four times three is twelve	Two plus three equals five  times three is eighteen	4.0
What is five times three	Fifteen	3.0
To guess the rule or you started with the rule	Yeah this is right	3.0
So this is the rule that you invented	Yeah	0.0
So is this something that they asked you yesterday or you just  thought of	I just thought of	0.0
If you want to tell someone without  giving specific examples how would you tell what the rule is	Plus three times three	3.0
Would you do  addition first or	X plus three	3.0
X is the number that you start with	Yeah	0.0
OK	X plus three times three equals Y	3.0
So if I see it written this way then you think I would do first I would  add three and then I would multiply the result by three	Yeah	0.0
What would you do	Why is it two	2.0
Huh	Why is it two	2.0
You say it is twentyone how did you go about it	Five plus two is seven seven times three is twentyone	4.0
To find the answer for this expression	Twentyone	4.0
Twentyone	Five plus two is seven times three is twentyone	4.0
Two times three is six and that is five so I would say the answer is  eleven	Oh I know what you do	0.0
T1 Why you put parentheses	That shows that you should do that first  before you do anything else	4.0
That shows that you should do that first  before you do anything else	Thats what our teacher did	4.0
T1 So you need that to avoid confusion here	You think we should put the  parentheses here	0.0
Would you leave this rule the same way	This rule	0.0
This is yours	He said	0.0
Feel free to use the board and show me and tell me	Well	0.0
But I dont know what went on	When when we came up with that thing that almost was like the Pascals Triangle	3.0
When when we came up with that thing that almost was like the Pascals Triangle	What was it with e	2.0
What was it with e	What were we doing	2.0
What were we doing	It was um	0.0
It was um	Ten ten percent of a hundred	3.0

Yeah thats what it was	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats this	1.0
Thats this	OK this is scary	0.0
OK this is scary	Look when we were cause we were discussing like percentages	1.0
Look when we were cause we were discussing like percentages	And uh like an increase and we did a hundred and we took ten percent of it and thats one two one thats one three three one and you know that is	4.0
And uh like an increase and we did a hundred and we took ten percent of it and thats one two one thats one three three one and you know that is	Yeah we kept going it	1.0
Yeah we kept going it	It doesnt come out yeah	1.0
It doesnt come out yeah	After a while it goes	1.0

And we were also trying to find like you know how we had when we had a plus b to the n	We want to know what And we had like numbers before it when we got to big numbers we want to know you figure out what the numbers were like in front of the a you know cubed	1.0
We want to know what And we had like numbers before it when we got to big numbers we want to know you figure out what the numbers were like in front of the a you know cubed	You know thats thats like um	0.0
You could use the board too	Uh we just Like if you were looking if we were looking for like a plus b	3.0
Uh we just Like if you were looking if we were looking for like a plus b	To the tenth	1.0

You know what Im saying	But if theres oh yeah two	1.0
But if theres oh yeah two	All right I see what youre saying	1.0
All right I see what youre saying	Thats all	1.0
Thats all	There could be a hundred colors but it would still	1.0
There could be a hundred colors but it would still	Yeah you pick two things out of those ten	1.0
Yeah you pick two things out of those ten	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	How many different places can you put them	2.0
How many different places can you put them	Put them	0.0
Put them	All right	0.0
All right	All right	0.0
All right	Fortyfive I think	1.0
Eight red ones or eight as	Then it would be ten	3.0
Then it would be ten	Um	0.0
Um	Ten choose eight	1.0
Ten choose eight	Choose eight yeah	1.0
Choose eight yeah	A smaller number	1.0
A smaller number	Because that would be how many different spots can you move those eight of one color in the tower of ten	4.0
Because that would be how many different spots can you move those eight of one color in the tower of ten	Now how do you	0.0
Now how do you	Its fortyfive also	1.0
Why	Like how do you how do you how do you do that on a calculator	2.0
Howd you do that so fast Michael	Um	0.0
Um	No I just like did it all in my head thats all	0.0
No I just like did it all in my head thats all	You go to uh math	0.0
Tell us how you did it	Um	0.0
Um	Probability	3.0
Probability	Theres a button that	0.0
Theres a button that	NCR	0.0
NCR	Take ten that button then eight	3.0
Take ten that button then eight	Then math	1.0
Then math	And it comes out fortyfive	3.0
And it comes out fortyfive	Why is that the case	2.0
Why is that the case	Hm	0.0
Hm	Well if you take like on the	0.0
Well if you take like on the	Well because	0.0
Well because	You know how on Pascals Triangle	1.0
You know how on Pascals Triangle	Thats like the two	1.0
Thats like the two	You have eight left over	1.0
You have eight left over	Oh cause you could switch them all around	1.0
Oh cause you could switch them all around	Is that is that I guess youre counting	1.0
Is that is that I guess youre counting	You got you got yeah	0.0
Tell me	Cause then you would have	0.0
Cause then you would have	Is that the same thing as that because like the eight left over to get to the ten right	3.0
Is that the same thing as that because like the eight left over to get to the ten right	Itll be It would be the same thing	1.0
Itll be It would be the same thing	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	Its like almost switching colors	1.0
Its like almost switching colors	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Itd be like two of the other color	1.0
Itd be like two of the other color	And then and then yeah exactly	1.0
Say that one more time Romina	Itd be two of the other color instead of like say you started with red for this two	4.0
Itd be two of the other color instead of like say you started with red for this two	That was for the reds and then when you make red eight	4.0
That was for the reds and then when you make red eight	That would be the other eight	1.0
That would be the other eight	The like say the blues have two	1.0
The like say the blues have two	And its seven	1.0
And its seven	And then obviously three should be the same as that	1.0
And then obviously three should be the same as that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
So youre pressing the calculator you have a new command that gets you those numbers	We know how to do it I mean its not	0.0
But if you didnt have the calculator	Wed write them out	0.0
Wed write them out	Youd have to write them all out	0.0
Youd have to write them all out	Well Bob	0.0
Because Alex wants to know how you do that without a calculator	Well I obviously if the calculator	0.0
Can you can you help him understand that	Well we would make a say tower of ten	3.0
Well we would make a say tower of ten	Can I say something	0.0
Can I say something	All right um	0.0
All right um	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Bob	0.0
Bob	Yeah go for it	0.0
Yeah go for it	No Im talking I just wanted to say that Bob Sidley had like an actual formula to write the equals and	1.0
No Im talking I just wanted to say that Bob Sidley had like an actual formula to write the equals and	Do we know do we know what it is	2.0
Do we know do we know what it is	I think so	0.0
I think so	I dont know if I can remember it	0.0
Why dont I leave you a few minutes and think about explaining this to us	It depends on	0.0
It depends on	Well its not its not that hard to explain	0.0
Well its not its not that hard to explain	You remember it	0.0
You remember it	I forgot it	0.0
OK Ill stay then	Well actually no	0.0
Well actually no	Its not right	0.0
Its not right	All right	0.0
He has a bad memory	I got to like do trial and error to see if I can figure it out what it was	0.0
OK	All right say thats ten	3.0
All right say thats ten	Then um you would just have to find Say you had uh one was one color and two was the other color	3.0
Then um you would just have to find Say you had uh one was one color and two was the other color	Why why dont you show her how to do it for like three	0.0
Why why dont you show her how to do it for like three	Show them how we can get all of them	0.0
Show them how we can get all of them	That you have to draw the tower	1.0
That you have to draw the tower	You have two colors	1.0
You have two colors	And out of this tower of three youd have to find out all the different places you could put those two colors in	4.0
And out of this tower of three youd have to find out all the different places you could put those two colors in	So you could put it there and there	4.0
So you could put it there and there	Or you could put it uh there and there	4.0
Or you could put it uh there and there	Or am I missing any	1.0
Or am I missing any	Yes I am	0.0
I understand	You could just do like	0.0
You could just do like	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Do you want to go for another one	0.0
Do you want to go for another one	No go for it	0.0
No go for it	No you could just do you could do like our blue blue blue	0.0
No you could just do you could do like our blue blue blue	You gonna write every one	0.0
You gonna write every one	Well there wasnt that many	0.0
Well there wasnt that many	No Im just like giving you an example	0.0
No Im just like giving you an example	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then you just kind of move it through	0.0
And then you just kind of move it through	And thats how we figure them out when we have to write them out	0.0
So youre saying theres a way of getting these without the calculator	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And theres a theres a formula that somebody	3.0
And theres a theres a formula that somebody	Not too	1.0
Not too	had come up with but I dont know I dont know how it how it goes	2.0
had come up with but I dont know I dont know how it how it goes	Im really not sure	2.0
Im really not sure	Ive seen it	0.0
Ive seen it	I dont remember it	2.0
I dont remember it	Yeah theres some	0.0
Yeah theres some	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Something to that effect	1.0
Something to that effect	It was this guy	1.0
It was this guy	Thats it	1.0
Thats it	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Its this right here	1.0
Its this right here	Yeah	1.0
Why dont you show us up here Michael	Oh man I I didnt come up with this so dont ask me why	0.0
It doesnt matter that you came up with it	If you would have like n choose x	3.0
If you would have like n choose x	Thats on thats on the division n to the x or is that just like your	1.0
Thats on thats on the division n to the x or is that just like your	That n to the x	1.0
That n to the x	No thats thats choose to the thats how you write it I think	1.0
No thats thats choose to the thats how you write it I think	I think thats how you write it	1.0
I think thats how you write it	Thats just thats what it is	1.0
Do you want an equals sign there	No	0.0
No	Thats thats not in Yeah	0.0
Thats thats not in Yeah	Yeah I could do that	0.0
Yeah I could do that	Times x	3.0
Times x	That that would be the number	3.0
Come on in	Hi	0.0
Hi	Sorry I m late	0.0
We re glad you re here	Didn t you go with them	0.0

I went with Steve	That s dirty	0.0
Hi did you eat	No	0.0
Are you hungry	Yeah I guess so	0.0
Yeah I guess so	But it s all right	0.0
But it s all right	It s all right	0.0
It s all right	You can uh	0.0
I ll tell you what	I hate stopping	0.0
I hate stopping	All right what are we going to do	2.0
All right what are we going to do	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh yeah um	0.0
Oh yeah um	What what does that get	2.0
What what does that get	That gets you like	0.0
That gets you like	That gives you that choose thing	1.0
That gives you that choose thing	That gives you	0.0
That gives you	I dont I dont know what it means	2.0
I dont I dont know what it means	I was working with him one day when he brought that up but he lost me	2.0
I was working with him one day when he brought that up but he lost me	That was the day that me and and my table were doing the uh finding the square roots without a calculator	0.0
That was the day that me and and my table were doing the uh finding the square roots without a calculator	Yeah but he did that before like	0.0
Yeah but he did that before like	Not with me	0.0
Not with me	In class when he was talking about choosing	0.0
In class when he was talking about choosing	Who	0.0
Who	I was in your group	0.0
I was in your group	Oh gee you got an eyelash	0.0
Oh gee you got an eyelash	No in class when he was talking about choosing	0.0
No in class when he was talking about choosing	He figured it out	0.0
He figured it out	And	0.0
And	All right um well you figure say you do uh say youre doing three right	0.0
All right um well you figure say you do uh say youre doing three right	So that would be three times two times one	4.0
So that would be three times two times one	That would be each space I imagine	4.0
That would be each space I imagine	And x is how many how many you want of the color	1.0
And x is how many how many you want of the color	Yeah I guess that would be how many combinations	1.0
Yeah I guess that would be how many combinations	Yeah that would because that would give you the total number of	4.0
Yeah that would because that would give you the total number of	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah that d be it yeah	1.0
Yeah that d be it yeah	Total number of combinations	1.0
Total number of combinations	Oh I guess yeah	1.0
Oh I guess yeah	All right	1.0
All right	So then that would be say six factorial	1.0
So then that would be say six factorial	Divided by	1.0
Divided by	That would be Why would you why where does that work	2.0
That would be Why would you why where does that work	No wait	1.0
No wait	This is that would be	0.0
This is that would be	Come on x is the number we want and x is like the number we want to get like the choose number	1.0
Come on x is the number we want and x is like the number we want to get like the choose number	Thats the yeah choosing number	1.0
Thats the yeah choosing number	And	0.0
And	So I guess this would	0.0
So I guess this would	He was telling me like this was	0.0
He was telling me like this was	That would like take away all the all the ones we would choose	1.0
That would like take away all the all the ones we would choose	He said something about repeats	1.0
He said something about repeats	One would take away the repeats	1.0
One would take away the repeats	Yeah this would this would take away the repeats right	1.0
Yeah this would this would take away the repeats right	I guess	1.0
I guess	And will this and this will give you	1.0
And will this and this will give you	And this will this will take away the	1.0
And this will this will take away the	This will take away all the other ones	1.0
This will take away all the other ones	The other ones that that you dont care where they are	1.0
The other ones that that you dont care where they are	Like the ones that are higher than	1.0
Like the ones that are higher than	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	You only care about you only care about the two that are moving	1.0
You only care about you only care about the two that are moving	Not the other	1.0
Not the other	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	Not the other uh four	1.0
Not the other uh four	Its just	0.0
Its just	And then and X	1.0
And then and X	That makes sense	1.0
That makes sense	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	That make lets see if it works	1.0
That make lets see if it works	So say	0.0
So say	Wheres factorial on this	2.0
Wheres factorial on this	Wheres the exclamation point	2.0
Wheres the exclamation point	Math	1.0
Math	Ah	0.0
Ah	Probability 4	1.0
Probability 4	What are we doing three or six	0.0
What are we doing three or six	Just hit four	1.0
Just hit four	All right	0.0
All right	I mean would you	0.0
I mean would you	I dont even know why I did that	2.0
I dont even know why I did that	That was stupid	0.0
That was stupid	Uh quit all right	0.0
Uh quit all right	Six divide	1.0
Six divide	Six divided by	1.0
Six divided by	Where is the little where is that	2.0
Where is the little where is that	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Uh	0.0
Uh	Are you doing why are you doing the six only	2.0
Are you doing why are you doing the six only	Oh because three factorial is six right	1.0
Oh because three factorial is six right	You got it	1.0
You got it	Thats not six factorial	1.0
Thats not six factorial	Um divided by three minus whats X	2.0
Um divided by three minus whats X	We dont know	2.0
We dont know	Do two	1.0
Do two	Minus two	1.0
Minus two	Times	1.0

Youre a lot farther on that than I am	You have to put a parenthesis around that whole thing too	1.0
You have to put a parenthesis around that whole thing too	Later on that	0.0
Later on that	Then times	1.0
Then times	No you got to at the beginning of that and the end of this thing	1.0
No you got to at the beginning of that and the end of this thing	Get rid of that one there	1.0
Get rid of that one there	Dont we have to close that in though	1.0
Dont we have to close that in though	No you dont have to close that	1.0
No you dont have to close that	Oh	0.0
Oh	All right	0.0
All right	So do I have to delete that other one	1.0
So do I have to delete that other one	No	0.0
No	No leave that like that	1.0
No leave that like that	Two	1.0
Two	So divided by two factorial	1.0
So divided by two factorial	Um	0.0
Um	Let s see	0.0
Let s see	Lets see	0.0
Lets see	And do it the other way and it should come out	1.0
And do it the other way and it should come out	What way what was the other way	2.0
What way what was the other way	Did did it work	1.0
Did did it work	Four	1.0
Four	No its three	1.0
No its three	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh thats all right	1.0
Oh thats all right	Yeah it works	1.0
Yeah it works	All right	0.0
All right	Yeah thats the case then	1.0
Yeah thats the case then	All right so when Ankurs done eating you can explain all this	0.0
All right so when Ankurs done eating you can explain all this	And we can explain it to Ankur	0.0
And we can explain it to Ankur	Cause you know that s coming	0.0
Cause you know that s coming	Ankur missed the beginning so explain it to him	0.0
Ankur missed the beginning so explain it to him	There wasn t really a beginning though	0.0

By yourself	Yeah righ	0.0
Yeah righ	Well my dad	0.0
Well my dad	All right um	0.0
All right um	Do you want to hear our explanation of of this and why this works	0.0
That would be really great but it would help us enormously if you would use the board	I wrote that so you dont have to	0.0
Would you mind Jeff	All right I need help because	2.0
Theyll help you	I dont want to get stuck	0.0
I dont want to get stuck	I got stuck up there last time by myself and I was looking like an idiot	0.0
I got stuck up there last time by myself and I was looking like an idiot	All right the reason why this works	0.0
All right the reason why this works	We have no chalk	0.0
We have no chalk	Right there in the side	0.0
Right there in the side	All right the reason why this works first you get all the total number of this will cover all the total possibilities of your tower	3.0
All right the reason why this works first you get all the total number of this will cover all the total possibilities of your tower	And factorial	1.0
And factorial	Say in terms of a tower	1.0
Say in terms of a tower	The factorial right here	1.0
The factorial right here	So say youre doing towers of three	1.0
So say youre doing towers of three	You have the three factorial and thatll cover all of the different combinations that you could put three in with two colors	1.0
You have the three factorial and thatll cover all of the different combinations that you could put three in with two colors	All right	0.0
All right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Sounds good	1.0
Just go	Like you should use the explanation like she used	1.0
Like you should use the explanation like she used	Like the people on the line	1.0
Like the people on the line	Thats better because you have like the first one	1.0
Thats better because you have like the first one	Then you have	1.0
Then you have	Two spaces	1.0
Two spaces	All right Ill do people on the line	1.0
All right Ill do people on the line	Two spaces	1.0
Two spaces	You have two people left so thats times two	1.0
You have two people left so thats times two	All right say were doing us three right here	1.0
All right say were doing us three right here	Yeah on the line	1.0
Yeah on the line	This us three um	1.0
This us three um	Theres three different people to fill in the first spot	1.0
Theres three different people to fill in the first spot	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Then theres after then once one goes there theres only two people left to fill in this spot	1.0
Then theres after then once one goes there theres only two people left to fill in this spot	And then	0.0
And then	So you multiply three and two	1.0
So you multiply three and two	Three times two and then once once someone goes in the other theres only one person left	4.0
Three times two and then once once someone goes in the other theres only one person left	And they get the last spot so thats times the one	4.0
And they get the last spot so thats times the one	And thats everyone	1.0
And thats everyone	That make more sense	0.0
Well Im I didnt mind your other example here	Yeah I I just like the okay through the way so I could move	0.0
Yeah I I just like the okay through the way so I could move	You know steady progress	0.0
But I guess so why are you multiplying	We dont like that question	0.0
We dont like that question	Ah	0.0
You dont like that question	No	0.0
No	That that one gets us all the time	0.0
Why arent you adding	Uh because you dont add	0.0
Uh because you dont add	Its just you dont do it	0.0
Its just you dont do it	Theres no adding going on it any where anymore	0.0
Theres no adding going on it any where anymore	Thats like out of style	0.0
Thats not the answer	I know that doesnt that doesnt work	0.0
I know that doesnt that doesnt work	Um you do it because uh	0.0
Um you do it because uh	I cant help you on this one	0.0
I cant help you on this one	Yeah I know	0.0
Yeah I know	Yeah were	0.0
Yeah were	Thats a good question	0.0
OK Ill leave you to tell me	Why do you multiply	2.0
Youll figure that out	We never know this one	0.0
We never know this one	Yeah its like the eternal question	0.0
Yeah its like the eternal question	Yeah its cause if if you have three things theres three things you put here right	3.0
Yeah its cause if if you have three things theres three things you put here right	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	There s red white and blue	3.0
There s red white and blue	And then theres only	3.0
And then theres only	Uh are we	0.0
Uh are we	two things	3.0
two things	And if theres two more	1.0
And if theres two more	Out of that two	1.0
Out of that two	Were doing just two colors	1.0
Were doing just two colors	Were doing two colors	1.0
Were doing two colors	Yeah just do No were Yeah	1.0
Yeah just do No were Yeah	If you have like three things right	1.0
If you have like three things right	To explain it maybe you want to do three different colors	1.0
To explain it maybe you want to do three different colors	No	1.0
No	Yeah all right maybe we can do that	1.0
Yeah all right maybe we can do that	All right how you saying this	2.0
All right how you saying this	There s red white and blue right	1.0
There s red white and blue right	OK	0.0
OK	You take if red goes over here that means you only have with red there could go either go white and blue	1.0
You take if red goes over here that means you only have with red there could go either go white and blue	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	Like its each one of those three goes with two more	1.0
Like its each one of those three goes with two more	You know what I mean	1.0
You know what I mean	Theres three things	1.0
Theres three things	You could see how you got this	1.0
You could see how you got this	here and then theres two things here	1.0
here and then theres two things here	You can say you have	0.0
You can say you have	All right yeah	1.0
All right yeah	Each one of those those three goes with two other	1.0
Each one of those those three goes with two other	Those three things go with	1.0
Those three things go with	Oh OK like with our line thing	1.0
Oh OK like with our line thing	So its three times two	1.0
So its three times two	All right	0.0
All right	Like our line thing	1.0
Like our line thing	Or you could say like you have two more colors to add on	1.0
Or you could say like you have two more colors to add on	So you could do you could make these into two different combinations	1.0
So you could do you could make these into two different combinations	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So thats two	1.0
So thats two	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats  Yeah thats why	1.0
Thats  Yeah thats why	All right	0.0
All right	Thats like times	4.0
Thats like times	Thats why you multiply	4.0
Thats why you multiply	Thats how you	1.0
Thats how you	Thats just why	1.0
Thats just why	All right	0.0
All right	Dont ask us anymore	0.0
Dont ask us anymore	All right so then all right	0.0
All right so then all right	Uh Researcher 1	0.0
Uh Researcher 1	Researcher 1	0.0
Researcher 1	All right I think were good with this	0.0
Explain it to me on the board	All right the reason here Ankur	0.0
All right the reason here Ankur	Just do it youre right there	0.0
Just do it youre right there	You re standing	0.0
You re standing	You could just say it	0.0
You could just say it	Um just do it with three colors	0.0
Um just do it with three colors	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	All right say you have three colors red white and blue	3.0
All right say you have three colors red white and blue	Uh here you do it	0.0
Uh here you do it	Yeah one of those colors goes in the first	3.0
Yeah one of those colors goes in the first	All right	0.0
All right	One of those colors goes in the first spot	3.0
One of those colors goes in the first spot	So say you have your three spots	1.0
So say you have your three spots	Say red goes in the first one all right	1.0
Say red goes in the first one all right	Then you could do	1.0
Then you could do	Either one of them	1.0
Either one of them	Draw the line to the white and the blue	1.0
Draw the line to the white and the blue	One one color goes in the first spot so theres two colors left	4.0
One one color goes in the first spot so theres two colors left	So theres three different colors that can go in the first spot and each of those colors can go with two other colors	4.0
So theres three different colors that can go in the first spot and each of those colors can go with two other colors	Two other ones	1.0
Two other ones	So this is either going to be a white and blue or a blue and a white	1.0
So this is either going to be a white and blue or a blue and a white	Right	0.0
Right	And then Or the white could to the first thing and this is going to be one of the two other colors or the blues going to go here and its going to be the other two are going to be the combination either way of the other one	4.0
And then Or the white could to the first thing and this is going to be one of the two other colors or the blues going to go here and its going to be the other two are going to be the combination either way of the other one	So thats why you multiply	4.0
So thats why you multiply	Make that a B	0.0
Make that a B	I used to have a BandAid on and now I can get the chalk to stick to my finger	0.0
I used to have a BandAid on and now I can get the chalk to stick to my finger	It is impressive huh	0.0
What does this have to do with the towers and what you were showing me about a plus b to the n	Well you want you asked us why you multiply	0.0
And why why they would be	We just answered why we multiply	0.0
We just answered why we multiply	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Were not there yet	0.0
OK	Were still working on that	0.0
Were still working on that	Yeah all right	0.0
Yeah all right	All right	0.0
All right	So thats why you multiply	4.0
So thats why you multiply	All right	0.0
All right	Moving on	0.0
Moving on	So thats why thats three factorial	4.0
So thats why thats three factorial	So thats all right thats good	0.0
So thats all right thats good	Thats all your combinations right there	1.0
Thats all your combinations right there	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	All right	0.0
All right	All right now were going to put that number over um n minus x um	1.0
All right now were going to put that number over um n minus x um	Factorial	1.0
Factorial	Explain that part	2.0
Explain that part	All right	0.0
All right	This the n would be the number you were	1.0
This the n would be the number you were	You want to you know you re choosing from	1.0
You want to you know you re choosing from	Like lets say two	1.0
Like lets say two	This is three choose two	1.0
This is three choose two	You want to know how many different places you could put those three	1.0
You want to know how many different places you could put those three	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So thats where the n comes in	1.0
So thats where the n comes in	So you	0.0
So you	So youre going to take a number so that would be that would be three and the same reason the threes up there its coming down here	1.0
So youre going to take a number so that would be that would be three and the same reason the threes up there its coming down here	Minus minus the x	1.0
Minus minus the x	Minus	1.0
Minus	Then itll give you one	1.0
Then itll give you one	Wait the reason you subtract thats why youre raising the how come the x is there	2.0
Wait the reason you subtract thats why youre raising the how come the x is there	Because youre raising it to two um	1.0
Because youre raising it to two um	Thats it	1.0
Thats it	Right	1.0
Right	Right	1.0
Right	Thats why its there	4.0
Thats why its there	And then	0.0
And then	The x	1.0
The x	Multiply	1.0
Multiply	And then that subtracted will give you will give you	1.0
And then that subtracted will give you will give you	If this was if this was a higher number like five choose two you that n minus x would be like a three and	4.0
If this was if this was a higher number like five choose two you that n minus x would be like a three and	And the factorial	1.0
And the factorial	Those	1.0
Those	will eliminate all the other ones	1.0
will eliminate all the other ones	Yes and those	1.0
Yes and those	that you dont want	1.0
that you dont want	Those three it doesnt you dont want to know where	1.0
Those three it doesnt you dont want to know where	It doesnt matter where they are	1.0
It doesnt matter where they are	Thats why you want you want you know eliminate them	4.0
Thats why you want you want you know eliminate them	Because you only youre only worrying about the two	4.0
Because you only youre only worrying about the two	How many different combinations that you could put those two in	4.0
How many different combinations that you could put those two in	Cause its five choose two	4.0
Cause its five choose two	Youre only worried about like the the two	4.0
Youre only worried about like the the two	Like I said the people on the line	1.0
Like I said the people on the line	Five people on the line you want to know how many different places you could put those those two people	1.0
Five people on the line you want to know how many different places you could put those those two people	All the other ones where	1.0
All the other ones where	Now theres going to be theres going to be a lot of a lot of repeats because youre also going to count by those other three people where theyre going to be and youre not worried about those other three people	4.0
Now theres going to be theres going to be a lot of a lot of repeats because youre also going to count by those other three people where theyre going to be and youre not worried about those other three people	So that only makes	1.0
So that only makes	So thats thats why you would divide to get rid of the to get rid of them	4.0
So thats thats why you would divide to get rid of the to get rid of them	To subtract them	1.0
To subtract them	No thats divide	1.0
No thats divide	Why divide that n minus x	1.0
Why divide that n minus x	Oh thats the way	1.0
Oh thats the way	All right	0.0
All right	All right	0.0
All right	OK all right	0.0
OK all right	And so you say the next part	0.0
And so you say the next part	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	All right	0.0
All right	And why why do we want	0.0
And why why do we want	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I dont I no its times huh	1.0
I dont I no its times huh	Times	1.0
Times	Actually that was supposed to be another one in there	1.0
Actually that was supposed to be another one in there	Why is why	0.0
Why is why	Didnt didnt you guys say something about repeats	1.0
Didnt didnt you guys say something about repeats	Yeah thats what Bob said	1.0
Yeah thats what Bob said	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I dont trust that kid	0.0
I dont trust that kid	That gets like the repeats out	1.0
That gets like the repeats out	But it worked	1.0
But it worked	It works	1.0
It works	Thats all	0.0
Thats all	All right we dont know where the the final x comes from	2.0
Why dont you um	Why dont we think about it	0.0
Why dont we think about it	Work on it	0.0
Hes looking at me not being convinced	What what um	0.0
What what um	Youre not convinced Ankur	1.0
Youre not convinced Ankur	Like I I mean how	0.0
Are you convinced Ankur about this	Yeah but say all right say were doing five choose two right with this	4.0
Yeah but say all right say were doing five choose two right with this	Then we go five factorial	4.0
Then we go five factorial	Which is what	2.0
Which is what	Thatll give you all the combinations they can put everybody in	1.0
Thatll give you all the combinations they can put everybody in	Uh twenty times three	1.0
Uh twenty times three	OK	0.0
OK	Sixty	1.0
Sixty	Would be sixty times two	1.0
Would be sixty times two	Onetwenty	1.0
Onetwenty	Onetwenty	1.0
Onetwenty	That would be its onetwenty right Romina	1.0
That would be its onetwenty right Romina	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Were faster than the calculator around here	0.0
Were faster than the calculator around here	Were good like that	0.0
Were good like that	So thatd be onetwenty	1.0
So thatd be onetwenty	And and if youre doing choose two obviously theres going to be a lot of times where those two are going to be in the same spot as the other three are going to be	4.0
And and if youre doing choose two obviously theres going to be a lot of times where those two are going to be in the same spot as the other three are going to be	What are you doing five choose two	1.0
What are you doing five choose two	you know I guess moving around different spots	1.0
you know I guess moving around different spots	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats why you want to get rid of the the n minus x thing	4.0
Thats why you want to get rid of the the n minus x thing	Yeah we got that makes sense	1.0
Yeah we got that makes sense	Yeah that that makes sense to you	0.0
Yeah that that makes sense to you	That that part right here is this all good	0.0
That that part right here is this all good	Up to this point	0.0
Up to this point	Do you understand why this is all happening	0.0
Im waiting for the whole thing	Whole thing	0.0
Whole thing	Oh were not done with that yet	0.0
Oh were not done with that yet	Then um then you multiply	3.0
Then um then you multiply	Well at this point here you have three	3.0
Well at this point here you have three	Thats six	1.0
Thats six	Yeah its six	4.0
Yeah its six	So you have onetwenty over six times five factorial	4.0
So you have onetwenty over six times five factorial	No isnt it	1.0
No isnt it	Oh I think its the repeats	1.0
Oh I think its the repeats	Or	0.0
Or	Would would be like	0.0
Would would be like	Isnt it three factorial two factorial	1.0
Isnt it three factorial two factorial	Three factorial	1.0
Three factorial	Oh two oh its act all right yeah	1.0
Oh two oh its act all right yeah	Two	1.0
Two	Yeah I guess the the x	1.0
Yeah I guess the the x	Thats the number you were raising	1.0
Thats the number you were raising	That x	1.0
That x	and and five choose x say and there was	1.0
and and five choose x say and there was	That s what	1.0
That s what	Since you Mm hm	1.0
Since you Mm hm	And this was	0.0
And this was	I get it	0.0
I get it	I get it	0.0
I get it	I get it	0.0
I get it	I get it	0.0
I get it	I I got it now	0.0
I I got it now	Like that	0.0
Like that	All right then the last number would be	1.0
All right then the last number would be	Because this just gives you the number	1.0
Because this just gives you the number	You have Yeah	1.0
You have Yeah	Youre going to multiply by the number	1.0
Youre going to multiply by the number	Those those you want to get rid of those	1.0
Those those you want to get rid of those	The all the combinations that the three are moved around and those those two arent	1.0
The all the combinations that the three are moved around and those those two arent	Yeah they	1.0
Yeah they	But then those two themselves will be repeat	1.0
But then those two themselves will be repeat	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	You will be mixed up	1.0
You will be mixed up	Be repeating thats what you that s why you	1.0
Be repeating thats what you that s why you	Thats why you want to get rid of that too	4.0
Thats why you want to get rid of that too	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	And then so that would be just two	1.0
And then so that would be just two	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So it would be onetwenty divided by twelve and you get ten	4.0
So it would be onetwenty divided by twelve and you get ten	Is that what it is	1.0
Is that what it is	Yeah it is	1.0
Yeah it is	Do you get like why we divide by the n minus x and the the x	0.0
Do you get like why we divide by the n minus x and the the x	You know you you get that	0.0
Could you	You dont get that	0.0
Ankur did you have that	What what part don t don t	0.0
I wonder if Ankur could explain	I dont think the x	0.0
I dont think the x	All right	0.0
All right	The top thing the n to the the n to the uh factorial was going to give you how many	2.0
The top thing the n to the the n to the uh factorial was going to give you how many	Thats all the combinations	1.0
Thats all the combinations	Thats every single combination	1.0
Thats every single combination	I got that	0.0
I got that	That I got	0.0
That I got	Right	0.0
Right	Now youre youre only worried about them those two people in that line	1.0
Now youre youre only worried about them those two people in that line	So theres going to be some instances where those two people are going to be in the same place and those three	1.0
So theres going to be some instances where those two people are going to be in the same place and those three	Are the ones changing	1.0
Are the ones changing	Will be you know will be switch you know changing	1.0
Will be you know will be switch you know changing	And thats	0.0
And thats	So thats that would be the the three factorial	1.0
So thats that would be the the three factorial	You want to you want to get rid of that	1.0
You want to you want to get rid of that	You want to get rid of them	1.0
You want to get rid of them	Wait say that again	1.0
Wait say that again	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Well we	0.0
Well we	Dont worry about that three were doing like five	1.0
Dont worry about that three were doing like five	No were doing this one so the two	1.0
No were doing this one so the two	All right so you have the five minus two is that what youre explaining on there	1.0
All right so you have the five minus two is that what youre explaining on there	Five minus two thats	1.0
Five minus two thats	So you have the hundred and twenty different combinations	1.0
So you have the hundred and twenty different combinations	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Total	1.0
Total	All right	0.0
All right	But you dont think like when those two people are going to be in these two spots	1.0
But you dont think like when those two people are going to be in these two spots	And everyone else is changing	1.0
And everyone else is changing	not those other three	1.0
not those other three	And those are those are those make no difference because all were worried about are where those two people are	1.0
And those are those are those make no difference because all were worried about are where those two people are	Oh like when oh oh okay okay okay	0.0
Oh like when oh oh okay okay okay	All right those two people are going to be moving around and it you know theyre like	1.0
All right those two people are going to be moving around and it you know theyre like	These people are going to stay the same and every all the three people theyre just going	1.0
These people are going to stay the same and every all the three people theyre just going	the two people staying in the same place	1.0
the two people staying in the same place	So thats why you get rid of that	4.0
So thats why you get rid of that	You know going nuts	1.0
You know going nuts	But then those two people themselves could switch places too	1.0
But then those two people themselves could switch places too	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	You know what Im saying	0.0
You know what Im saying	Umhuh	0.0
Umhuh	Or if	0.0
Or if	So then you got to get rid of those too	1.0
So then you got to get rid of those too	there were three that could go on	1.0
there were three that could go on	So thats why you get rid of the three	4.0
So thats why you get rid of the three	Thats why you do the x factorial	4.0
Thats why you do the x factorial	Then you get rid of the you know	1.0
Then you get rid of the you know	The other one	1.0
The other one	Yeah so you get rid of those	1.0
Yeah so you get rid of those	OK	0.0
OK	And then then	0.0
And then then	Oh there you go	0.0
Oh there you go	That makes sense	1.0
That makes sense	Because youre not worried about every each person	4.0
Because youre not worried about every each person	Just the two	1.0
Just the two	Just worry about two right	1.0
Just worry about two right	Just those two	1.0
Just those two	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	Yeah we all have I got it	0.0
Yeah we all have I got it	Im good	0.0
Im good	Extension	1.0
Can you explain this because poor Researcher 3 is trying to understand this and shes not following Michael	Something like I understood it but	0.0
Something like I understood it but	Just go through it dude	0.0
Just go through it dude	All right	0.0
All right	The top number is five factorial thats the total number of possibilities for for five for five people	3.0
The top number is five factorial thats the total number of possibilities for for five for five people	One twenty	1.0
One twenty	And then the five minus two comes comes in where youre not worried about everyone youre just worried about two people at a time	4.0
And then the five minus two comes comes in where youre not worried about everyone youre just worried about two people at a time	So we need to subtract the five minus two	4.0
So we need to subtract the five minus two	Those get that gives you and you do factorial that gives you all the possibilities of just two people right	4.0
Those get that gives you and you do factorial that gives you all the possibilities of just two people right	No that gives you	1.0
No that gives you	Three people	1.0
Three people	No three extras	1.0
No three extras	The three that you dont youre not worried about	1.0
The three that you dont youre not worried about	Thats going to eliminate everyone except the two people youre worried about	1.0
Thats going to eliminate everyone except the two people youre worried about	OK	0.0
OK	Everyone except the two people youre worried about	1.0
Everyone except the two people youre worried about	And then the x factorial eliminates except the	1.0
And then the x factorial eliminates except the	When the two people	1.0
When the two people	Two people yeah	1.0
Two people yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	When the two people are switched back and forth when you have the same ones over again	1.0
When the two people are switched back and forth when you have the same ones over again	OK	0.0
I think Im getting switch back So could you give me an example	Like when you have when you have like person A and over here	3.0
Like when you have when you have like person A and over here	You want to stand up and show them	0.0
You want to stand up and show them	And person B over here	3.0
And person B over here	And then you have person B and person A	3.0
And then you have person B and person A	You want to be in a line and well show them	0.0
Michael start from the beginning very slow	All right	0.0
All right	You have five people	3.0
Stand up and show us	All right Im going to sit in your seat cause I can t see	0.0
All right Im going to sit in your seat cause I can t see	Im going to write it nice and clear so you all can see	0.0
Im going to write it nice and clear so you all can see	All right	0.0
All right	You got five people in a line	3.0
You got five people in a line	You agree with me thats how many different combinations you can put those five people	0.0
That part I understand	All right	0.0
I understood the multiplication that you showed	Now in youre only worried you want to know how many different places you can put those two people	3.0
Now in youre only worried you want to know how many different places you can put those two people	All right	0.0
All right	So in all the combinations youre going to have theyre going to be repeated a lot	4.0
So in all the combinations youre going to have theyre going to be repeated a lot	A lot	4.0
A lot	When you have like the two people in a certain place and you know those three	4.0
When you have like the two people in a certain place and you know those three	If the three are are like this	4.0
If the three are are like this	And then one of them switches thats another combination	4.0
And then one of them switches thats another combination	And you get a lot of repeats like that	4.0
OK	So by eliminating that you eliminate the combinations that repeat by the three people moving around	4.0
Uhhum	Then lets say you just have those two people in in any given combination	4.0
Then lets say you just have those two people in in any given combination	If if one if this guy switches the place with this guy its the theyre different combinations but in this were not worried about where they are	4.0
If if one if this guy switches the place with this guy its the theyre different combinations but in this were not worried about where they are	We just you understand	0.0
Mm hm	Thats why we get rid of the the two factorial to to uh eliminate the amount like as many times as you could as many combinations as you could put those two people	4.0
Thats why we get rid of the the two factorial to to uh eliminate the amount like as many times as you could as many combinations as you could put those two people	Right	0.0
Right	Like the three would would be to eliminate the combinations you could put those three people that youre not worried about	4.0
Like the three would would be to eliminate the combinations you could put those three people that youre not worried about	Then the two they would repeat because those people too they move around	4.0
Then the two they would repeat because those people too they move around	They they could they move around in the in the line also	4.0
They they could they move around in the in the line also	And then when when when youre done with all that you just get um you get how many places you can just put that two	4.0
And then when when when youre done with all that you just get um you get how many places you can just put that two	Like youre not worried if like you dont care who they are	4.0
Like youre not worried if like you dont care who they are	You dont care like if this guy has a switch with this guy	4.0
You dont care like if this guy has a switch with this guy	You understand like why you would eliminate how that eliminates	4.0
And now Im thinking of towers that are five tall	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You can we just	0.0
And were talking of those that have two reds	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Well	0.0
Explain it to me with that	All right	0.0
All right	Say say were doing were doing towers that were were five tall	4.0
Say say were doing were doing towers that were were five tall	Towers of five tall with two different colors in it	4.0
Towers of five tall with two different colors in it	Then thats the total amount of possibilities is the five factorial that you could have	4.0
Then thats the total amount of possibilities is the five factorial that you could have	All right in with with five high with the combinations	4.0
All right in with with five high with the combinations	So thats where thats the five factorial on top	4.0
So thats where thats the five factorial on top	Then the three factorial on the bottom would be five different five different spots minus the two spots that youre concerned about leaving you with the three other spots	4.0
Then the three factorial on the bottom would be five different five different spots minus the two spots that youre concerned about leaving you with the three other spots	You could say	0.0
You could say	that you dont care about	0.0
that you dont care about	Thats going to eliminate all of them	3.0
Thats going to eliminate all of them	Thats like if you say like the reds	1.0
Thats like if you say like the reds	Lets say reds are our two colors that they stay in the same place and like	1.0
Lets say reds are our two colors that they stay in the same place and like	Reds	1.0
Reds	Theyre	0.0
Theyre	Like yeah the two stay in the same place and then the other three are just switching while theyre in staying in the same place	1.0
Like yeah the two stay in the same place and then the other three are just switching while theyre in staying in the same place	Yeah theyre staying in the same spot	1.0
Yeah theyre staying in the same spot	But were not concerned with them	1.0
But were not concerned with them	Thats why youre not concerned with those	4.0
Thats why youre not concerned with those	Its going to repeat like six times	1.0
Its going to repeat like six times	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So thats where the three factorial comes from and youre multiplying that by the two factorial	4.0
So thats where the three factorial comes from and youre multiplying that by the two factorial	Those are what youre	0.0
Those are what youre	Thats to say like the first place and the third place and then they just switch	1.0
Thats to say like the first place and the third place and then they just switch	Yeah like this way	1.0
Yeah like this way	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	They just dont have a name on them so the theyre the same thing	1.0
They just dont have a name on them so the theyre the same thing	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then thats where the bottom number comes from and then you divide them by each other and that gives you what were looking for	4.0
But why were we doing this	Uh you we dont	0.0
Uh you we dont	We were talking about	0.0
We were talking about	We want you wanted us to explain choose	0.0
We want you wanted us to explain choose	The choose that we all right whoa	0.0
The choose that we all right whoa	Which goes back to Pascals Triangle and see where a plus b	3.0
Which goes back to Pascals Triangle and see where a plus b	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	to the n	3.0
to the n	And we could figure out the beginning number	3.0
And we could figure out the beginning number	All right	0.0
All right	Over here you wanted the a plus b to the n thing you wanted to know how we got the choose thing	1.0
Over here you wanted the a plus b to the n thing you wanted to know how we got the choose thing	What does that mean	2.0
What does that mean	Yeah how we got the third number	1.0
Yeah how we got the third number	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And thats how we got off to to here	1.0
OK so what did that have to do with what you did in class today	Thats how we would get the number	3.0
Thats how we would get the number	We were looking at we were doing this in class today	1.0
We were looking at we were doing this in class today	Thats what we were doing	1.0
Thats what we were doing	We were looking at a plus b	1.0
We were looking at a plus b	Were going to be	0.0
Were going to be	It was like in Pascals Triangle things go like by that	1.0
It was like in Pascals Triangle things go like by that	Like this choose this	1.0
Like this choose this	Like um if you go to the one three three one part of it it would be um	1.0
Show me on the board Michael	Go get em Mike	0.0
Go get em Mike	This would be like all right this would be like three choose one	4.0
This would be like all right this would be like three choose one	How many different places you put that one that one guy	4.0
How many different places you put that one that one guy	Theres only one place	4.0
Theres only one place	Theres only oh Im wrong	4.0
Theres only oh Im wrong	What am I doing	2.0
What am I doing	Thats when you only have like its all one color	1.0
Thats when you only have like its all one color	No there theres a way it has something to do with I think that would be three choose zero I guess	4.0
No there theres a way it has something to do with I think that would be three choose zero I guess	No	4.0
No	All right and then the next one would be three choose three	4.0
All right and then the next one would be three choose three	Obviously three different places	4.0
What was the next one	Three choose one	4.0
Three choose one	The next would be three choose two which we just figured that out	4.0
The next would be three choose two which we just figured that out	Theres three	4.0
Theres three	And last one is three choose three	4.0
And last one is three choose three	You can only put those three people in those three places	4.0
You can only put those three people in those three places	You cant you know no more places to put them	4.0
You could write more rows of that triangle	Yeah	0.0
So can you take lets say another row or two and show me the addition rule and what it looks like with your new notation	You re talking about the addition rule when you	3.0
For a particular for a particular row	Add this and this and go like that	3.0
Do you understand my question	Uh I dont really	2.0
Uh I dont really	I dont understand	2.0
I dont understand	Instead of writing three you write	0.0
You explained to me	Why you add	0.0
Why you add	Yeah	0.0
You might might be useful for folks who havent heard it to hear it whatever way you want to explain it	I dont think I can explain it too good	0.0
Youve had it a few ways	Um I cant I cant remember too well	0.0
Um I cant I cant remember too well	I know why you add if I explain it I dont think anyone will understand	0.0
Try	I didnt	0.0
I didnt	Didnt I tell you guys like last time I came here	0.0
Didnt I tell you guys like last time I came here	Well go for it dude just	0.0
Well go for it dude just	You could try	0.0
You could try	You dont have that paper do you	0.0
You dont have that paper do you	You can just hand them hand that out	0.0
You can just hand them hand that out	You started talking about toppings	1.0
You started talking about toppings	I think something	0.0
I think something	Hand that out instead	0.0
Hand that out instead	Just	0.0
Just	Um all right	0.0
Um all right	If all right lets go to lets go to this one	0.0
If all right lets go to lets go to this one	This would be like three different places I guess	3.0
This would be like three different places I guess	Which one are we looking at	0.0
Which one are we looking at	That one right there	0.0
That one right there	You have three	3.0
You have three	That would be a plus b to the third	1.0
That would be a plus b to the third	All right lets say you have like heres a number all right	1.0
All right lets say you have like heres a number all right	Zero means no toppings	1.0
Zero means no toppings	One would this one would be	1.0
One would this one would be	It would be one s a topping	1.0
It would be one s a topping	One would be a topping	1.0
One would be a topping	So first category is everything with no toppings	4.0
So first category is everything with no toppings	And thats you cant make thats thats your number for that one	4.0
And thats you cant make thats thats your number for that one	Next would be Theres all the the ones that have one topping	4.0
Next would be Theres all the the ones that have one topping	Right you got to make that zero at the end	4.0
Right you got to make that zero at the end	You messed up	1.0
You messed up	What	0.0
What	Last one should be a hundred not a hundred and one	1.0
Last one should be a hundred not a hundred and one	I knew that	0.0
I knew that	Theres your um your three choose one	4.0
Theres your um your three choose one	And theres three different combinations you could put that	4.0
And theres three different combinations you could put that	Um I can go on forever doing this	4.0
Um I can go on forever doing this	But um when you have a new when you add another place another topping	4.0
But um when you have a new when you add another place another topping	That could be one or the other one or the other one or the other	1.0
That could be one or the other one or the other one or the other	So it could be one or the other	1.0
So it could be one or the other	It could be a zero or a one a zero or a one a zero or a one	1.0
It could be a zero or a one a zero or a one a zero or a one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	All right	0.0
All right	So all these threes would either move up a step onto the next category and uh have two toppings	4.0
So all these threes would either move up a step onto the next category and uh have two toppings	Or they might stay behind and still only have one if they have the zero	4.0
Or they might stay behind and still only have one if they have the zero	So three three will get a topping and go to this one	4.0
So three three will get a topping and go to this one	And three won t will stay	4.0
And three won t will stay	And obviously this guy s going to get a topping	4.0
And obviously this guy s going to get a topping	That s why you add this one	4.0
That s why you add this one	Uhhuh	1.0
Uhhuh	So now this guys going to have without toppings	4.0
So now this guys going to have without toppings	Youre going to add a topping onto him	4.0
Youre going to add a topping onto him	Thats going to be one topping	4.0
Thats going to be one topping	These three with one topping wont get one so you know	4.0
These three with one topping wont get one so you know	Thats their four	1.0
Thats their four	You put you can put them in the same category as this one	1.0
You put you can put them in the same category as this one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats four	1.0
Thats four	Those are your four	1.0
Those are your four	And you know	0.0
And you know	Three	1.0
Three	Those three	1.0
Those three	The three that had two toppings wont get any	1.0
The three that had two toppings wont get any	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So they ll go to	0.0
So they ll go to	And you could put them in together with the ones that did get something	4.0
And you could put them in together with the ones that did get something	That s why you would add	4.0
That s why you would add	Keep on adding	1.0
What do you mean by toppings	Pizza toppings	3.0
Um for example	Like here you would have a choice of three different ones	4.0
Like here you would have a choice of three different ones	Here you would have a choice of five and like the ones would be like the mushrooms the peppers the whatever just by going like	4.0
Here you would have a choice of five and like the ones would be like the mushrooms the peppers the whatever just by going like	The one would indicate you have it or not	4.0
I remember	You remember	0.0
One three three one	Mm hm	0.0
If I wrote these as chooses the way you re writing them	Three choose zero three choose one	3.0
This is three choose zero	Yeah	0.0
This is three choose one	Choose one	0.0
Choose one	Same thing	1.0
Three choose	Two and three choose then three choose three choose three	3.0
Right	So that s how you get it	4.0
So that s how you get it	It s like the same thing cause like three and zero is like three and three right	4.0
It s like the same thing cause like three and zero is like three and three right	And then three two	4.0
OK so	You want us to write the triangle looking like that	3.0
I would I would I would like you to do that and then tell me what the general rule is	All right	0.0
So so I d like you to write out some of the rows with the triangle and then I d like	So to use it like like that	0.0
So to use it like like that	Like the next one would be uh four choose zero	3.0
Like the next one would be uh four choose zero	Yeah and	1.0
Yeah and	Four choose	1.0
Four choose	The four choose zero then four choose one four choose two	4.0
The four choose zero then four choose one four choose two	Four choose one four choose two	1.0
Four choose one four choose two	Four choose three	1.0
Four choose three	We re in a bad place	1.0
You probably want to use this	Yeah	0.0
So that people can read it	Um	0.0
Um	Ask them your question one more time	0.0
OK so I d like you to rewrite your triangle if you like	From top to bottom	0.0
Top to bottom	Do you want the ones and like	0.0
Do you want the ones and like	All right	0.0
All right	So what	0.0
I want everything	What would	0.0
Do you understand	Uhhuh	0.0
Uhhuh	Thats thats easy	0.0
And then I would like the general row	Is that one	0.0
Where you have towers	Thats a zero no that s zero choose zero	3.0
Thats a zero no that s zero choose zero	X high	1.0
Something like that	All right well thats	0.0
So he can tell you	See like that	3.0
See like that	So it would be um like N over not two over	1.0
So it would be um like N over not two over	Well it would be	1.0
Well it would be	N choose	1.0
N choose	It would be	1.0
It would be	Well and N make N like your height or something	1.0
Well and N make N like your height or something	All right so say	0.0
All right so say	N equals height	1.0
N equals height	Well that would	0.0
Well that would	Well write the X	4.0
Well write the X	Write a plus b to the whatever it is next to it	4.0
Write a plus b to the whatever it is next to it	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	You know what I mean	0.0
You know what I mean	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So right	0.0
So right	That would be a plus b to the	1.0
That would be a plus b to the	This would be nothing you know it would be adding	1.0
This would be nothing you know it would be adding	Yeah zero one two	1.0
Yeah zero one two	So a plus b to the second	1.0
So a plus b to the second	Well itd be like N over N minus but what	2.0
Well itd be like N over N minus but what	Yeah well a plus b to the second so it would be if or a plus b to the nth	1.0
Yeah well a plus b to the second so it would be if or a plus b to the nth	To the	0.0
To the	No all you need is like	0.0
No all you need is like	N is factorial	1.0
N is factorial	Itd be n n over	1.0
Itd be n n over	n fa	1.0
n fa	n mi	1.0
n mi	No thats just like No its not right Im just saying like	1.0
No thats just like No its not right Im just saying like	It would be	0.0
It would be	You would have to multiply it	1.0
You would have to multiply it	n over	1.0
n over	Well if you had an n it would be uh	1.0
Well if you had an n it would be uh	To the height of the tower which is n right	1.0
To the height of the tower which is n right	Youd have a bunch of ns	1.0
Youd have a bunch of ns	Yeah and itd be over just z	1.0
Yeah and itd be over just z	Thered be n plus one ns going this way	1.0
Thered be n plus one ns going this way	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	All right	0.0
All right	it would be n over 0	1.0
it would be n over 0	So if n was three youd have four ns going this way	4.0
So if n was three youd have four ns going this way	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And the bottom numbers would be just going from 0 to	1.0
And the bottom numbers would be just going from 0 to	Just	0.0
Just	To	0.0
To	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Well yeah	1.0
Well yeah	0 to n	1.0
0 to n	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	To n	1.0
To n	To n	1.0
To n	Whatever n equals	1.0
Whatever n equals	Is there a way to write that you know how to write over times	2.0
Is there a way to write that you know how to write over times	I guess	0.0
I guess	Yeah so how do you yeah wait now that makes sense but so it would be n over 0 to the nth	1.0
Yeah so how do you yeah wait now that makes sense but so it would be n over 0 to the nth	And whatever	0.0
And whatever	Zero what are you talking about	2.0
Zero what are you talking about	Wherever youre looking for	1.0
Wherever youre looking for	What are you talking about 0 to the n	1.0
What are you talking about 0 to the n	0 minus n	1.0
0 minus n	That would be negative	1.0
That would be negative	No not minus like thats to whatever n is n over 0 n over 1	1.0
No not minus like thats to whatever n is n over 0 n over 1	1	1.0
1	Not divided by like n 1 n uh 2 n 3	1.0
Not divided by like n 1 n uh 2 n 3	That was	0.0
That was	All the way until n could be over n	1.0
All the way until n could be over n	You know what Im saying	0.0
You know what Im saying	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Not not divided by	1.0
Not not divided by	I was using bad uh bad looking things there	0.0
I was using bad uh bad looking things there	Each of those would be a number	1.0
Each of those would be a number	Yeah it s what 0 to n	1.0
Yeah it s what 0 to n	And n represents the height of the tower	1.0
And n represents the height of the tower	The height of the tower yup	1.0
The height of the tower yup	Yeah n n represents	1.0
Do you want that divided sign here	No	0.0
On that one	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	Cross that off	0.0
Cross that off	No	1.0
No	I was using it to separate and that was that s a habit of mine it looks bad	0.0
I was using it to separate and that was that s a habit of mine it looks bad	Oh sorry about that	0.0
Oh sorry about that	It would be uh as many it s like height of the tower with two colors	1.0
It would be uh as many it s like height of the tower with two colors	You have two numbers	1.0
You have two numbers	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	How do you how are you can you write that to get this	1.0
How do you how are you can you write that to get this	Like that s what I meant	1.0
Like that s what I meant	Like I didn t mean factorial	1.0
Like I didn t mean factorial	I meant like when we used four first and like three first	1.0
I meant like when we used four first and like three first	I don t know how to write that though	2.0
So you go 0 1 2 3 dot dot dot up to n	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mm hm	1.0
Can we get one in the middle there like n choose r	Like how would you just go right to n choose 3	2.0
Like how would you just go right to n choose 3	Or n choose r	2.0
Or n choose r	Like what	0.0
Like what	What are you talking about	2.0
What are you talking about	Like instead of using 0 1 2 3	3.0
Like instead of using 0 1 2 3	r being any number on the bottom	1.0
Because you said n choose x up there	Yeah	0.0
I just picked what I wanted	Oh you want uh you want to do that	0.0
Oh you want uh you want to do that	Yeah so so it would be	0.0
Yeah so so it would be	Um	0.0
Um	n choose	3.0
n choose	It would be n	1.0
It would be n	Wouldn t that just be n choose r for whatever r you wanted	1.0
Wouldn t that just be n choose r for whatever r you wanted	Whatever number you wanted up to as long as it didn t exceed n	1.0
Whatever number you wanted up to as long as it didn t exceed n	This this is different than that	1.0
This this is different than that	Isn t it	1.0
Isn t it	Like this these are just like a list of numbers	1.0
Like this these are just like a list of numbers	That s that s just giving you one of these numbers	1.0
That s that s just giving you one of these numbers	Uh you know all that but I m saying if you wanted to write n choose to get a certain number wouldn t it just be n choose r	1.0
Uh you know all that but I m saying if you wanted to write n choose to get a certain number wouldn t it just be n choose r	Like that	1.0
Like that	And then as long as r doesn t exceed n or it s less than 0 like r	1.0
And then as long as r doesn t exceed n or it s less than 0 like r	Wouldn t that equal that	1.0
Wouldn t that equal that	Yeah wouldn t it	1.0
Yeah wouldn t it	I guess you could write one of those	0.0
I guess you could write one of those	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Isn t it supposed to equal that	1.0
Isn t it supposed to equal that	Right there	0.0
Right there	That s that is	0.0
That s that is	It s the same thing	1.0
It s the same thing	That does	1.0
That does	You could do that	1.0
You could do that	It s a lot of	1.0
OK so you ve written out three rows and then you wrote out the nth row	The reason why 0 1 2 3 is that number is always going to be that number	4.0
The reason why 0 1 2 3 is that number is always going to be that number	It s not it s never going to change	4.0
Something in here could be an n choose r	Mm hm	0.0
That s what I heard you say Jeff	Yes	0.0
Sort of a general one in here n choose x	That s what	0.0
Whatever you choose to use	Yeah that s what that is	0.0
Yeah that s what that is	So yeah	0.0
You ve written out two rows and you have the third one there	Mm hm	0.0
Maybe somebody will come up here and write these up nicely	Is that what you want	0.0
Thanks	You want to erase those	0.0
You want to erase those	You want to make that the line so bad	0.0
You want to make that the line so bad	I know	0.0
I know	No don t do that	0.0
No don t do that	How far do you want him to go	2.0
How far do you want him to go	One more	0.0
One more	I want to uh	0.0
I want to uh	You want one more for good measure	0.0
You want one more for good measure	No	0.0
No	Don t worry about it	0.0
Go to the nth one then	Wouldn t that just be	0.0
Dot dot dot	N zero	3.0
N zero	Dot dot dot N to the N	1.0
Is the last one N N	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	Yeah	1.0
Do you want to put it at the end	Yeah put it at the end make it nice	0.0
What would you how would you show the middle one	Uh actually you could put N X	3.0
N choose X N choose N	Those are dots because you can t really make a dot	0.0
Those are dots because you can t really make a dot	Now you can	0.0
Let s say from give me an example from the third fourth row to the fifth row	Fourth row to this	3.0
Fourth row to the fifth	The three to the four	3.0
The three to the four	Oh fourth row	1.0
Oh fourth row	All right	0.0
Which ones would it be	That would like you re saying from here to here going to there	1.0
That would like you re saying from here to here going to there	Uhhuh	1.0
How would you draw your little arrow to shows that	This one and that one	3.0
This one and that one	Yeah is that it	1.0
Yeah is that it	Is that all so that s all you want	1.0
Is that all so that s all you want	Yeah	1.0
Do you believe that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah I believe so	0.0
You all believe that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Uhhuh	1.0
No one could persuade you otherwise	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Right	Three choose two should equal four choose two	4.0
Three choose two should equal four choose two	Look at all the numbers are added up	1.0
So whats four choose two plus four choose three	Four choose two plus four choose three	0.0
Four choose two plus four choose three	That would be that would be five	3.0
That would be that would be five	Oh five	1.0
Oh five	Five choose	1.0
Five choose	Five choose three	1.0
Five choose three	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Right	1.0
Right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
I dont know if Rominas convinced	Why is it five choose three	2.0
Yeah I dont think Jeff is either	Is this here	0.0
Is this here	Yeah I dont really	0.0
Yeah I dont really	Because its its always the one on the right	4.0
Because its its always the one on the right	Because see this guy gets another topping I guess so he turns he would be a two	4.0
Because see this guy gets another topping I guess so he turns he would be a two	Uhhuh	1.0
Uhhuh	Whatever it is in here	1.0
Whatever it is in here	And this guy doesnt so it stays two	1.0
And this guy doesnt so it stays two	Ah it doesnt so that s two	1.0
Ah it doesnt so that s two	So	0.0
So	It wasn t that	1.0
It wasn t that	Because hes moving up this bottom numbers going to change	4.0
Because hes moving up this bottom numbers going to change	Oh all right	1.0
Explain that one more time Michael please	Here	0.0
Here	Um wherever this guy goes wherever this guy goes hes going to get another topping because hes moving this way	4.0
Um wherever this guy goes wherever this guy goes hes going to get another topping because hes moving this way	Umhm	1.0
Umhm	So that turns it into a two	1.0
So that turns it into a two	So this bottom numbers going to change to two	1.0
So this bottom numbers going to change to two	This guys not going anywhere	4.0
This guys not going anywhere	Cause the bottom number stays the same	4.0
Cause the bottom number stays the same	So its going to be five	4.0
So its going to be five	Because you know the next ones going to be five and it it has to be a two because You understand why you add	1.0
Because you know the next ones going to be five and it it has to be a two because You understand why you add	All right	0.0
All right	Good	0.0
Good	Im with you	0.0
Did you eat Brian	No	0.0
You can watch us	We dont get another break	0.0
You can	I dont think you want to know what I went through	0.0
I dont think you want to know what I went through	Well at least you got a tux	0.0
Were glad youre here	Neither did I	0.0

All right	Well all right	0.0
Well all right	You remember	0.0
You remember	All right were looking at were looking at this right here	0.0
All right were looking at were looking at this right here	You guys got to pay attention to it	0.0
Erase it better Jeff before you start because	Yeah remember and you didnt pay me back for like three months	0.0
Yeah remember and you didnt pay me back for like three months	I had it the whole time	0.0
I had it the whole time	Yeah but it cancelled out	0.0
Yeah but it cancelled out	All right	0.0
All right	Say we have this row right here	4.0
Say we have this row right here	We got um N choose 0	4.0
We got um N choose 0	And over here we have N choose X	4.0
And over here we have N choose X	And then over here we have N choose N	4.0
And then over here we have N choose N	All right	4.0
All right	Then this right here would be Oh were explaining the general addition the addition rule using this type of to fill out the triangle	4.0
Then this right here would be Oh were explaining the general addition the addition rule using this type of to fill out the triangle	Using chooses to fill out the triangle and this here would be N choose X plus one and then N N choose X plus two and so on to whatever N equals	4.0
Using chooses to fill out the triangle and this here would be N choose X plus one and then N N choose X plus two and so on to whatever N equals	Right there d be dot dot I didnt I didnt leave enough room	4.0
Right there d be dot dot I didnt I didnt leave enough room	And this here would be X minus one and then	4.0
And this here would be X minus one and then	You did that one man	0.0
You did that one man	What	0.0
What	Nothing	0.0
Nothing	Thatd be X minus two and so on each way	3.0
Thatd be X minus two and so on each way	Right	1.0
Right	So itd be that	0.0
So itd be that	Can I see the row above that	1.0
Can I see the row above that	And the row above this would be N minus one right	1.0
And the row above this would be N minus one right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	Um choose zero	1.0
Um choose zero	This again would be N N minus one choose X and then	1.0
This again would be N N minus one choose X and then	N minus one	1.0
N minus one	N minus one N minus one	1.0
N minus one N minus one	Thats a one	1.0
Thats a one	Um how do you want me to to Where do you want me to go from here	2.0
Well you know um Brian wasnt here so you might want to give him some background to what youve been doing	Start at the beginning	0.0
Start at the beginning	We did we worked for an hour and a half getting to this point	0.0
We did we worked for an hour and a half getting to this point	Explaining this doing this	0.0
Explaining this doing this	All right um	0.0
But Brians a quick study	Thats what I am	0.0
Thats what I am	All right	0.0
All right	We did uh this is Pascals Triangle using the choose situation	3.0
We did uh this is Pascals Triangle using the choose situation	The whole choose thing	1.0
The whole choose thing	Thats what this is	1.0
Thats what this is	You know how choose works like one three three one	1.0
You know how choose works like one three three one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Three choose zero three choose one	1.0
Three choose zero three choose one	One four six	1.0
One four six	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Its all like chooses of something	1.0
Its all like chooses of something	All right	0.0
All right	So um I dont Um how would you like to uh how do you want to do this	2.0
So um I dont Um how would you like to uh how do you want to do this	How do you want to	0.0
How do you want to	Were just	0.0
Were just	Well tell him what we did	0.0
Well tell him what we did	replacing the three in the chooses by Ns and Xs	1.0
replacing the three in the chooses by Ns and Xs	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	And rather doing like uh rather Say this is the uh	0.0
And rather doing like uh rather Say this is the uh	If N was three	1.0
If N was three	Yeah say if N was the third row it would be three choose zero	4.0
Yeah say if N was the third row it would be three choose zero	That would give you one	4.0
That would give you one	Like you know how it s one three three one	4.0
Like you know how it s one three three one	Three choose zero gives you one	4.0
Three choose zero gives you one	Three choose one	1.0
Three choose one	That d be three	1.0
That d be three	That would give you the three	1.0
That would give you the three	The three choose two	4.0
The three choose two	That would give you the other three	4.0
That would give you the other three	Thats equal to three and then three choose three	4.0
Thats equal to three and then three choose three	That equals the other one	4.0
That equals the other one	And like thats filling out this part of the triangle and so on	4.0
And like thats filling out this part of the triangle and so on	And thats what thats what were doing now	0.0
And thats what thats what were doing now	We went other stuff we did we did the whole we found that equation to find out choose	0.0
We went other stuff we did we did the whole we found that equation to find out choose	What choose means	1.0
What choose means	Yeah we did all that	0.0
Yeah we did all that	And choose	1.0
And choose	But you missed out on all that	0.0
But you missed out on all that	Thats the choose equation	1.0
Thats the choose equation	Thats the choose equals	1.0
Thats the choose equals	And we spent time explaining	0.0
And we spent time explaining	Thats what we spent the bulk bulk of the thing trying to figure out how to explain that	0.0
Thats what we spent the bulk bulk of the thing trying to figure out how to explain that	Whats that little exclamation point	2.0
Whats that little exclamation point	Factorial	1.0
Factorial	Factorial	1.0
Factorial	Factorial	1.0
Factorial	Factorial	1.0
Factorial	Thats what it is	1.0
Thats what it is	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	All right	0.0
All right	It was really excited like N	0.0
It was really excited like N	You want to know what this is	1.0
You want to know what this is	Thats all the combinations	1.0
Thats all the combinations	Thats minusing	1.0
Thats minusing	You know how like theyre saying	0.0
You know how like theyre saying	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	three choose two	1.0
three choose two	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	We dont care about the three so thats like when the threes are switching not the twos	4.0
We dont care about the three so thats like when the threes are switching not the twos	And thats when the twos are like in the first place and the third place and they just switch and nothing else moves	4.0
And thats when the twos are like in the first place and the third place and they just switch and nothing else moves	So this	1.0
So this	Its basically the same thing	1.0
Its basically the same thing	Is this is that this over this	1.0
Is this is that this over this	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Its N N factorial over N minus X factorial times X factorial	4.0
Its N N factorial over N minus X factorial times X factorial	And that equals N choose X	1.0
And that equals N choose X	Like this is when the the things we dont No Im just saying these are the things that we dont care about when they they switch and this is when the things we do care about just switch in the same place and everything stays the same	4.0
Like this is when the the things we dont No Im just saying these are the things that we dont care about when they they switch and this is when the things we do care about just switch in the same place and everything stays the same	All right	0.0
All right	And thats all of them	1.0
And thats all of them	The Readers Digest version	0.0
The Readers Digest version	Yeah	0.0
What was that Ankur	No I just said like the Readers Digest version or something	0.0
The Readers Digest version	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So where where do you want to go with with this	2.0
Well I want you to show me how the addition rule works in general	All right	0.0
All right	Well that s not much of a problem	0.0
So you showed me what N minus one choose X	Go from go from go from N X and N X plus one	0.0
Go from go from go from N X and N X plus one	Wait this is this is	0.0
Wait this is this is	Yeah add that in terms of X	3.0
Yeah add that in terms of X	Like below it you know what I mean	0.0
Like below it you know what I mean	Add these two	1.0
Add these two	What are these two going to equal	2.0
What are these two going to equal	All right well that s gonna be	0.0
All right well that s gonna be	We want the next	0.0

N choose X um plus	Plus	1.0
Plus	N choose X plus one	1.0
N choose X plus one	Equals that	1.0
Equals that	Plus one equals that right there	1.0
Plus one equals that right there	Then well thats thats because this would be gaining an X and going into the X plus one	1.0
Then well thats thats because this would be gaining an X and going into the X plus one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And this would be losing an X	1.0
And this would be losing an X	No no not losing not getting anything	1.0
No no not losing not getting anything	Staying the same	1.0

Dont be easy on them Brian make them work	What what were doing is the next line of the triangle Remember how today in class you know how the other triangle was one two three that whole row there	4.0
What what were doing is the next line of the triangle Remember how today in class you know how the other triangle was one two three that whole row there	Well thats the increase in N and then the X plus one	4.0
Well thats the increase in N and then the X plus one	If you added another topping onto your whole	4.0
If you added another topping onto your whole	Say were doing pizzas	4.0

Thats all were doing	We we were explaining why you add	1.0
We we were explaining why you add	All right keep going	0.0
All right keep going	And why you do it is it cause when you add another topping like onto it this one	4.0
And why you do it is it cause when you add another topping like onto it this one	Say the toppings were one and zero	4.0
Say the toppings were one and zero	Uhhuh	1.0
Uhhuh	If it gets a topping thats why it goes up to the X plus one	4.0
If it gets a topping thats why it goes up to the X plus one	And since it doesnt get anything itll stay the same	4.0
And since it doesnt get anything itll stay the same	And in this one its staying the same right	4.0
And in this one its staying the same right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And thats why its going there	4.0
And thats why its going there	Like saying thats the zero	4.0
Like saying thats the zero	OK	0.0
OK	And going to there	3.0
And going to there	Make sense	1.0

See that N plus one parenthesis that Michael just put there	Yeah	0.0
Suppose you distributed that minus one	So you want all right so All right	0.0
So you want all right so All right	Why would you want to do that	2.0
Why would you want to do that	So distributing say over there right	4.0
So distributing say over there right	You d have you d have N plus one minus X minus one factorial	4.0
You d have you d have N plus one minus X minus one factorial	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	Um that would be in in parenthesis	3.0
Um that would be in in parenthesis	Oh yeah yeah there you go	1.0
Oh yeah yeah there you go	And then well that	0.0
And then well that	Why dont you get another piece of paper	0.0
Why dont you get another piece of paper	So all right so itd be N plus one factorial divided by um N plus one in parentheses minus X minus one factorial	4.0
So all right so itd be N plus one factorial divided by um N plus one in parentheses minus X minus one factorial	All right	0.0
All right	And then well thats thats pretty much all you can do there	0.0
And then well thats thats pretty much all you can do there	Then X plus one factorial so you could actually can you can cancel out	4.0
Then X plus one factorial so you could actually can you can cancel out	Can you cancel that out	4.0
Can you cancel that out	The X minus X minus one and the X plus one	4.0
The X minus X minus one and the X plus one	Or	0.0
Not right not now necessarily but um	Yeah can you I mean can you cross out factorials or is that the first factorial on the bottom of the one all the way to the right	3.0
Yeah can you I mean can you cross out factorials or is that the first factorial on the bottom of the one all the way to the right	Does that affect thats affecting the N plus one too so can you are you allowed to cross out like that	3.0
Does that affect thats affecting the N plus one too so can you are you allowed to cross out like that	Cross these both out	3.0
What do you all think	Well can we throw in numbers and see	0.0
Well can we throw in numbers and see	Would we be able to cross out the N plus ones	3.0
Would we be able to cross out the N plus ones	Well then what are you left with	2.0
Well then what are you left with	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It doesnt	1.0
It doesnt	Factorial divided by factorial	1.0
Factorial divided by factorial	Now wouldnt that just be uh	0.0
Now wouldnt that just be uh	Now Im saying you could	1.0
Now Im saying you could	But now youre talking about simplifying wouldnt that just be uh	1.0
But now youre talking about simplifying wouldnt that just be uh	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	I dont would that this whole thing be	0.0
I dont would that this whole thing be	Yeah then it would be nothing right	1.0
Yeah then it would be nothing right	Plus one	1.0
Plus one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Then that would cross out and that would cross out	1.0
Then that would cross out and that would cross out	You get two factorials	1.0
You get two factorials	You cant do that	1.0
You cant do that	You know that	1.0
You know that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Shes talking about simplifying and you just like you know put that negative in there and it would be just N minus X	4.0
Shes talking about simplifying and you just like you know put that negative in there and it would be just N minus X	Where	2.0
Where	Wheres this at	2.0
Wheres this at	Right at N minus minus that one right there	1.0
Right at N minus minus that one right there	The one all the way to the side	1.0
The one all the way to the side	Oh yeah and then the all right so you so you do that N minus X factorial	1.0
Oh yeah and then the all right so you so you do that N minus X factorial	That	0.0
That	That could be	0.0
That could be	N minus	1.0
N minus	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	Uh Im not too good with my uh	0.0
Uh Im not too good with my uh	Simplification	0.0
Simplification	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah because that it would be You got the plus one	1.0
Yeah because that it would be You got the plus one	Im just wondering	0.0
Im just wondering	Wouldnt you wouldnt that equal N plus one minus X minus one	1.0
Wouldnt you wouldnt that equal N plus one minus X minus one	Yes then the plus one and the minus one	1.0
Yes then the plus one and the minus one	Are gone	1.0
Are gone	So it would be N minus X factorial	1.0
So it would be N minus X factorial	N minus X so	1.0
N minus X so	Itd be N minus X factorial um times X plus one factorial	4.0
Itd be N minus X factorial um times X plus one factorial	Right	1.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	A little simpler	1.0
A little simpler	I still dont like it though	1.0
I still dont like it though	Then but then you could cross out OK could you cross out	1.0
Then but then you could cross out OK could you cross out	Which are you talking about	2.0
Which are you talking about	Up no the bottom and the top	1.0
Up no the bottom and the top	The top	1.0
The top	Oh thats plus one	1.0
Oh thats plus one	All right my bad I wasn t even paying attention	1.0
All right my bad I wasn t even paying attention	Anything else to simplify	2.0
Anything else to simplify	Well if X equals negative one just	1.0
Well if X equals negative one just	And cant you do that on the other side too	1.0
And cant you do that on the other side too	Um	0.0
Um	Um	0.0
Um	That would be um	0.0
That would be um	It would be N minus one	1.0
It would be N minus one	N minus X minus one factorial	1.0
N minus X minus one factorial	No	1.0
No	No itll still be the same number	1.0
No itll still be the same number	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And itll be X plus one	1.0
And itll be X plus one	You want us to do that do that too	0.0
You want us to do that do that too	Or dont even bother	0.0
Or dont even bother	Factorial	1.0
Um you know of course the next thing to do is to learn how to do the algebra of factorials so that you indeed could do the addition	the factorial	3.0
As	Um six factorial over	3.0
Six factorial	Three fact four factorial times two factorial	3.0
Times two factorial right	Mm hm	0.0
Six times five	Times onetwenty	3.0
Times onetwenty	Thirty	1.0
Thirty	Yeah	1.0
Is that okay	Thats thats simplifying is great then you can	3.0
But can I do that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then you could cross out the four factorials and	3.0
And then you could cross out the four factorials and	Oh	0.0
Oh then I can cross out the four factorials	Oh all right that makes sense	0.0
Right	So you just get thirty divided by you get thirty divided by two	3.0
Yeah look at all the time that will save you in an SAT question	Thatd be big	0.0
But but if you think about this	She broke she broke it down farther	1.0
She broke she broke it down farther	Oh yeah she just	1.0
Oh yeah she just	Like rather than say you have six factorial	1.0
Like rather than say you have six factorial	Mm hm	1.0
Mm hm	She broke it down until she got a number that she got that she wanted	1.0
She broke it down until she got a number that she got that she wanted	She had two numbers	1.0
She had two numbers	That matched the number on the bottom	1.0
That matched the number on the bottom	All right	0.0
All right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Then you end up like with the two factorial and then cross out and thats thirty over the two factorial and thats two	4.0
Then you end up like with the two factorial and then cross out and thats thirty over the two factorial and thats two	So its just fifteen	4.0
So its just fifteen	But then it would probably be even longer than that	1.0
But then it would probably be even longer than that	Cause if N is a big number	1.0
Does it matter	youd have to write you would have to write N times N minus one times N minus	3.0
youd have to write you would have to write N times N minus one times N minus	Ask her for a copy of the problem	0.0
Ask her for a copy of the problem	Could we have a copy of the problem	0.0
Could we have a copy of the problem	I don t think you need it	0.0
I don t think you need it	I dont think we need one	0.0
Could you walk me through the problem you were working on	Okay	0.0
Okay	Theres seven games in a World Series	0.0
Theres seven games in a World Series	What are the chances the World Series will be won in four games five games six games and seven games	0.0
You mean exactly four games exactly five games exactly six games exactly seven games	mhmm	0.0
What did you find	Well we started by writing out the possibilities  didnt we	3.0
Well we started by writing out the possibilities  didnt we	Well that s what we did we wrote out the possibilities	3.0
Well that s what we did we wrote out the possibilities	I dont remember  we got one sixteenth for the fiTeachert one	2.0
I dont remember  we got one sixteenth for the fiTeachert one	Or two	2.0
Or two	It was two	1.0
It was two	Two	1.0
Two	And we linked it back to the uh triangle	1.0
And we linked it back to the uh triangle	Take it Mike	0.0
Could you walk me through that very slowly	We finished	0.0
We finished	I wish we had the stuff we had	0.0
Could you show me what it looks like and how you thought about it	We just um	0.0
We just um	Well the fiTeachert one was kind of  we knew that someone   you know there s two two people	3.0
Well the fiTeachert one was kind of  we knew that someone   you know there s two two people	In order to win in four games then one team had to win either all four games or the other team had to win all four games	1.0
In order to win in four games then one team had to win either all four games or the other team had to win all four games	So out of all the possibilities	1.0
What exactly  what exactly did you find there	That it was   the chance of that happening was oneeighth	3.0
And could you explain how you got that	One half one half one half one half	3.0
One half one half one half one half	Because	0.0
Because	Equals onesixteenth	1.0
Equals onesixteenth	And there are two possibilities of	1.0
And there are two possibilities of	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	We did that	1.0
We did that	And theres four games	1.0
Whats the half	The half is  okay the probability that if they played one game and you have two teams and they are equally whatever	3.0
The half is  okay the probability that if they played one game and you have two teams and they are equally whatever	Equally as good	1.0
Equally as good	The probability that one team would win	1.0
The probability that one team would win	You could win or lose	1.0
Okay	So youre	0.0
So youre making an assumption that the teams are equally matched	Yeah	0.0
That it s just as likely for one team to win as the other	Yeah	0.0
So that s the way you are framing your problem	Exactly	0.0
Okay	So then the fiTeachert game you have one half chance	3.0
So then the fiTeachert game you have one half chance	Its either the home team say or the away team   either H or A	1.0
Okay	So that would  you know you have either one or the other is going to win	4.0
So that would  you know you have either one or the other is going to win	And the same thing for each of them	4.0
And the same thing for each of them	And then was it half times half times half times half	4.0
And then was it half times half times half times half	And you get onesixteenth	1.0
And you get onesixteenth	Thats why it s   that s for one team winning	1.0
Thats why it s   that s for one team winning	Thats for one team winning	1.0
Thats for one team winning	And then for two teams winning  its twosixteenths or oneeighth	1.0
Could I ask a simpleminded question	mhmm	0.0
Why did you multiply	We did this in math	0.0
We did this in math	Because	0.0
Im sorry but I really want to know	Because adding  it wouldnt work	4.0
Because adding  it wouldnt work	Because youd have a half plus a half  youd get two	4.0
Because youd have a half plus a half  youd get two	And what would that prove	4.0
So youve eliminated adding	Eliminated adding	3.0
Eliminated adding	But	0.0
Why did you multiply	And if youre not going to add then you re not going to subtract	4.0
And if youre not going to add then you re not going to subtract	Because you have either  for this one you have either a home or an away	4.0
Because you have either  for this one you have either a home or an away	And for the next one you can either have another home or an away	4.0
And for the next one you can either have another home or an away	So for the home you add  Oh	4.0
So for the home you add  Oh	The home team wins or the away team wins or the home team wins and the home team wins or the away team wins and the home team wins or the away and the away	4.0
The home team wins or the away team wins or the home team wins and the home team wins or the away team wins and the home team wins or the away and the away	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	Thats what it is	1.0
Thats what it is	So for the fiTeachert one its either	1.0
So for the fiTeachert one its either	You follow that	1.0
You follow that	The square	1.0
The square	You know about that thing dont you	1.0
You know about that thing dont you	How many games  two	1.0
How many games  two	All you have to do is that little tree thing	1.0
Now in your table you have four  it looks like you have four possibilities in your table	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	This is the probability	3.0
So what does the table represent	The two times the two	3.0
The two times the two	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	We actually have to multiply	1.0
We actually have to multiply	The half times the half	1.0
The half times the half	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	This is	0.0
So here you re looking  are you looking at it in your  are you imagining a two game series at this point	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	This is just a two game series	0.0
This is just a two game series	And then if you had another one wed have	3.0
And then if you had another one wed have	For each of them youd add a home or away	1.0
For each of them youd add a home or away	Yeah	1.0
But this explains how from  the two possibilities	Thats why were multiplying	4.0
Thats why were multiplying	That is why were multiplying	4.0
For each of the two games you re multiplying because of that	And then for every one we kind of were consistent and then we d multiply again	3.0
So when you multiply four two s together you get sixteen	mhmm	0.0
mhmm	mhmm	1.0
And what does sixteen represent	The total possibilities of	3.0
The total possibilities of	Yeah of	1.0
Yeah of	Of anything	1.0
Of anything	Anything in the four game series	1.0
Anything in the four game series	No the total possibilities of	1.0
No the total possibilities of	Anything	1.0
Anything	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	In a four game series	1.0
In a four game series then there are sixteen possible ways	That something could happen	3.0
That something could happen	Out of those there are only two ways that	1.0
Out of those there are only two ways that	If there are two teams	1.0
If there are two teams	And then out of those there are only two ways where someone is going to win in four games	1.0
And then out of those there are only two ways where someone is going to win in four games	To the n	1.0
To the n	And that would be   yeah exactly	1.0
And that would be   yeah exactly	Two to the n	1.0
So it would be two out of sixteen	mhmm	0.0
mhmm	mhmm	1.0
And thats how you got oneeighth	Yes	3.0
So thats  so what do you  so the probability of one team or the other winning after just four games you found was an eighth	Yes	0.0
Okay   So what came next	So next you have to add another slot right	3.0
So next you have to add another slot right	mhmm	1.0
mhmm	And then it could be all sixteen possibilities with another A or another H on it but subtracting the two where someone already won right	4.0
And then it could be all sixteen possibilities with another A or another H on it but subtracting the two where someone already won right	Is that right	1.0
Is that right	That would be that would be in four games	1.0
That would be that would be in four games	So you have  you know what its going to be in four games	4.0
So you have  you know what its going to be in four games	You want H s only in four games because its out of sixteen	4.0
You want H s only in four games because its out of sixteen	And then out of all those sixteen possibilities that you had then all sixteen then can go to an A   like the next slot can be an A winning or the next one can be an H right	4.0
And then out of all those sixteen possibilities that you had then all sixteen then can go to an A   like the next slot can be an A winning or the next one can be an H right	Hmmmm	1.0
Hmmmm	So thats thirtytwo	1.0
So thats thirtytwo	So that makes thirtytwo	1.0
So that makes thirtytwo	Something over thirtytwo	1.0
Something over thirtytwo	Sixteen plus sixteen	1.0
Could you go through that a little more slowly	Alright	0.0
Im hearing two things that are interesting to me and Id like to know more about them	Were saying that	0.0
Okay	That	0.0
Let me say what the two things are  Im trying to get a clear question	Hmmmm	0.0
One is that  uh  with an additional game it looks like there s an additional multiplication	Hmmmm	0.0
Is that right	mhmm	0.0
The second thing is that you re taking into account in some way that as we go into a fifth game that the series hasnt been won already	Yes	0.0
I think you said something several of you said something like that	Thats why	0.0
One is	All right  All right well	0.0
All right  All right well	You re adding another one like he did so you re adding   you re multiplying onesixteenth	4.0
You re adding another one like he did so you re adding   you re multiplying onesixteenth	You re multiplying the onesixteenth  by another half	4.0
You re multiplying the onesixteenth  by another half	Half	1.0
Half	So you get one thirtytwo	1.0
So you get one thirtytwo	But from that you have to eliminate the possibility that   um  its won in four games	1.0
But from that you have to eliminate the possibility that   um  its won in four games	Oneeighth	1.0
Oneeighth	What	0.0
What	Oneeighth right	1.0
But is  does that complete the solution for this case	No	0.0
No	Then you got to  from there you got to count out how many of those someone actually wins it	3.0
Then you got to  from there you got to count out how many of those someone actually wins it	You have to find the ones	1.0
You have to find the ones	So you got like your  you have sixteen total games right that you had before	4.0
So you got like your  you have sixteen total games right that you had before	And then you have  out of those sixteen like with the four with the four  excuse me  from the fiTeachert game	4.0
And then you have  out of those sixteen like with the four with the four  excuse me  from the fiTeachert game	When you add the next thing on that s going to be the A or the H	4.0
When you add the next thing on that s going to be the A or the H	So there s going to be sixteen   the original sixteen with an A on the end and then the other original sixteen with an H on the end  where the away team wins one of the games	4.0
So there s going to be sixteen   the original sixteen with an A on the end and then the other original sixteen with an H on the end  where the away team wins one of the games	The home team wins the other sixteen of the games	4.0
There s something Im wondering about though Um  if they didnt win it in four games and	And they had	0.0
And they had	They had to win it	3.0
They had to win it	If they go to the fifth game	1.0
How do you deal with that	We looked at it like we counted up all the possibilities of all the games	3.0
We looked at it like we counted up all the possibilities of all the games	And you would have to have at least one team win four of those games	1.0
And you would have to have at least one team win four of those games	Yeah right	1.0
Yeah right	And make sure it ends in five games	1.0
And make sure it ends in five games	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then you count up all the	1.0
Oh I see	Count up all the chances  that was the next step	4.0
Count up all the chances  that was the next step	Then from here  from the thirtytwo that we had  then we counted up all the games where some where there was four As and four Hs  added them together	4.0
Then from here  from the thirtytwo that we had  then we counted up all the games where some where there was four As and four Hs  added them together	The four As and four Hs	4.0
The four As and four Hs	Not having like four four in a row and then losing	1.0
Not having like four four in a row and then losing	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Because then that would be a four game series	4.0
Because then that would be a four game series	Subtract two from the fiTeachert one	4.0
Subtract two from the fiTeachert one	So that s the total number won over thirtytwo and thats how we got the probability for the fifth game	4.0
On the one hand it gets won by the away team	Mhmm	0.0
So   so  it looks like  uh  the part we dont see yet because we havent explained it yet is what do the games what are the possibilities of the fiTeachert four games when the fifth game is a win for away or similarly what are the possibilities for the fiTeachert four games when the	Three	3.0
When	Three wins	3.0
When the home team wins	Three wins	3.0
How do you see those	It s with the triangle right	3.0
How do you count it	I saw it differently	3.0
Are you saying that there are a couple of different ways of seeing it	Yeah there s a different way of approaching that problem	3.0
Could we walk through all of them	I guess so	0.0
One at a time	Very simple	0.0
Very simple	One was writing them writing them out	3.0
One was writing them writing them out	Yeah you just write them out   just   yeah	1.0
Yeah you just write them out   just   yeah	I want to explain something	0.0
I want to explain something	There s the away team	3.0
There s the away team	Youre familiar with Pascals Triangle right	1.0
Youre familiar with Pascals Triangle right	Right	1.0
Right	You know those	1.0
Yeah	I had  theres a way to um connect that and binary numbeTeacher together	3.0
Yes	You are familiar with that	0.0
Mhmm	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I used that to find a solution to that problem	3.0
So I used that to find a solution to that problem	Right	0.0
Right	Let me just	0.0
How does it go	all right	0.0
all right	Well the connection would be like  this is a two number like the binary with two numbeTeacher in two places	3.0
Yes	The fiTeachert one is the amount the total number to only have  no ones in it	4.0
The fiTeachert one is the amount the total number to only have  no ones in it	The second one would be with one	4.0
The second one would be with one	And the third place would be the amount that had two right	4.0
So you re looking at the row 1  2  1	Well Im just going to give you an example   you undeTeachertand	0.0
Yes	This column has just one with whole zeros in it	3.0
Mhmm	This one has  theres two in that those four combinations that have	3.0
What are the two	This one and that one	3.0
Mhmm	And the last one all ones	3.0
Mhmm	And this holds true for the next one	3.0
And this holds true for the next one	This one has there s only one with all zeros	3.0
Yes	Theres three with uh  with one	3.0
Theres three with uh  with one	one	1.0
one	And theres	1.0
Why are there three with one	Cause theres three places	4.0
Cause theres three places	Theres only  theres only three ways to do it	4.0
Theres only  theres only three ways to do it	And it s like that	4.0
Okay	The next one would be three three with two ones	3.0
Mhmm	And the last one would be one with all three	3.0
Just  three	Well I was	0.0
Well I was	It s the same situation as the one except you re switching you re switching   the zero would be in the ones spot	3.0
It s the same situation as the one except you re switching you re switching   the zero would be in the ones spot	I kind of wrote an explanation about this	0.0
Oh you mean if it had two ones it	Its the same as having two zeros in that situation	3.0
Its the same as having two zeros in that situation	Cause youre having two of one number and one of the other	4.0
Cause youre having two of one number and one of the other	Um	0.0
I see	Use the board	0.0
There was an eraser down there and chalk by the the tray Um	Ill explain to you real quick why you add  em together which is kind of saying why is there three	3.0
Ill explain to you real quick why you add  em together which is kind of saying why is there three	And its the same probability	3.0
Okay	I wrote that up and I gave it to Dr Maher  if shes here  and I dont know what she did with it	0.0
I wrote that up and I gave it to Dr Maher  if shes here  and I dont know what she did with it	Shes probably probably reading it	0.0
Shes probably probably reading it	All right	0.0
All right	Um  in the in the previous in this category or whatever you have two numbeTeacher	3.0
Um  in the in the previous in this category or whatever you have two numbeTeacher	One of them has noth  nothing in it	3.0
One of them has noth  nothing in it	One of them has nothing in it like no ones in it	3.0
Um Hm	The second one has  theres two with just one	3.0
The second one has  theres two with just one	The last one theres all spaces are filled up or whatever	3.0
Okay	Then when you add another place to it	3.0
Yes	Each combination in there could turn into two different ones you undeTeachertand	3.0
Each combination in there could turn into two different ones you undeTeachertand	One will have another  one will have a zero or one at the end of it	3.0
I want to be just certain that I undeTeachertand exactly what youre seeing here	Take this fiTeachert number which is zero	3.0
Take this fiTeachert number which is zero	Uh the second	3.0
Yeah	Is one	3.0
Is one	This would be two	3.0
This would be two	And this is three	3.0
Mhmm	It s binary numbeTeacher	3.0
It s binary numbeTeacher	When you add another place to it now you have three spots to fill up  the these two this 00 still stays could become the same value	4.0
When you add another place to it now you have three spots to fill up  the these two this 00 still stays could become the same value	And this one could become one	4.0
And this one could become one	So now two are formed from every single com  possibility	4.0
Mhmm	Right	0.0
Right	You undeTeachertand	0.0
I do	That was like adding the extra slot	3.0
That was like adding the extra slot	Thats the extra slot with the two possibilities	1.0
Thats the extra slot with the two possibilities	Now when you when you add an extra slot obviously one of them is still going to have one and one of them is going to have two	4.0
Now when you when you add an extra slot obviously one of them is still going to have one and one of them is going to have two	So the 2 right here theres going to be two  one for each  that that still have one	4.0
Mhmm	Thats why you add it to that	4.0
Thats why you add it to that	And this one will have a  this one will add get one added   so thats one	4.0
And this one will have a  this one will add get one added   so thats one	So theres your three	4.0
So theres your three	They come together like that	4.0
They come together like that	This one there will be the other two of the   and now in terms of four combinations the other two will have uh two	4.0
This one there will be the other two of the   and now in terms of four combinations the other two will have uh two	And the ones that dont get it will have one	4.0
And the ones that dont get it will have one	You know what Im talking about	0.0
Yes I I think so	Um so they all  thats why they add together	4.0
Um so they all  thats why they add together	Um and then that would explain why theres a three there why theres a four	4.0
Um and then that would explain why theres a three there why theres a four	Because these three are ones that have an  a 1 added on	4.0
Mhmm	And they go into this category the ones that dont get anything added go into that one	3.0
Are you saying for example that  that six comes up by adding	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Like you add theres theres now theres with these three there with these two these six possibilities theres twelve of them	4.0
Uh huh	Six of them get a one added on to them	3.0
Right	There	0.0
There	That way that would give you  bring it to three	4.0
That way that would give you  bring it to three	Three ones in the in the series whatever and these three uh half of them dont get dont get a 1added onto them	4.0
Three ones in the in the series whatever and these three uh half of them dont get dont get a 1added onto them	That would that would leave them in the same category like with just three	4.0
Uh huh	Thats why you add would add them	4.0
Uh huh	You undeTeachertand that	0.0
And the whole triangle is built that way	Yeah by adding	3.0
Okay	Now when they had their their possibilities	0.0
Mhmm	I saw that like the fiTeachert possibility for the for one game or for winning in four games was two out of eight	3.0
I saw that like the fiTeachert possibility for the for one game or for winning in four games was two out of eight	And the next one was uh	0.0
And the next one was uh	We had two out of sixteen then one out of eight	1.0
We had two out of sixteen then one out of eight	It was two out of sixteen Mike	1.0
It was two out of sixteen Mike	It was two out of sixteen	1.0
It was two out of sixteen	Yeah one out of eight	1.0
Yeah one out of eight	Then it was uh eight out of thirtytwo the next one	1.0
Then it was uh eight out of thirtytwo the next one	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah I think so	1.0
Yeah I think so	Then eight out of thirtytwo	4.0
Then eight out of thirtytwo	And the last one was twenty out of whatever something	4.0
And the last one was twenty out of whatever something	It was out of something	4.0
It was out of something	It was out of sixtyfour	1.0
How did you find those	Well they they found it out by actually writing out every single one	4.0
Well they they found it out by actually writing out every single one	But then I I I was thinking  right theres a 1 a 4 and a 10 here and if you I guess double them you come out with these numbeTeacher a 2 an 8 and a 20 one doubled is two	4.0
But then I I I was thinking  right theres a 1 a 4 and a 10 here and if you I guess double them you come out with these numbeTeacher a 2 an 8 and a 20 one doubled is two	Because nothing there had a	4.0
Because nothing there had a	You know what Im talking about	0.0
You know what Im talking about	Because	0.0
Yes	Theres 4 doubled is an 8	4.0
Mhmm	Ten doubled is a twenty	4.0
Yes	Mike why cant you start from  another one	2.0
Why  what do you go by	Cause thats from four	4.0
Yes	Cause this is the the fourth place over	4.0
Cause this is the the fourth place over	Now um these are the how many games are won with three	4.0
Now um these are the how many games are won with three	All right	0.0
All right	How many  Im not saying As and Hs	3.0
How many  Im not saying As and Hs	Im using ones and zeros	3.0
Yeah that I  Okay so your ones and zeros are representing home and away	As and Hs Now these have  how many came out with all wins  all ones right	3.0
As and Hs Now these have  how many came out with all wins  all ones right	Out of three games	3.0
How does that fit into your picture	You know like	0.0
Then the away team wins one	Out of five games	3.0
Out of five games	No erase the zero	1.0
Lets make it a four game series	Okay	0.0
And how does that connect to the Pascal triangle that you drew	Um	0.0
So lets put another 1 lets put another 1on the end	All right	0.0
So they win the last game yeah	This combination would be to this  There should be out of part of these out of these ten	3.0
It would be one of those ten	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Um youve got uh am I right	0.0
Um youve got uh am I right	Yeah I think you are	1.0
Yeah	I had it	0.0
I had it	Um  I dont know	2.0
Um  I dont know	It would be one of the four	1.0
It would be one of the four	One of the four	1.0
One of the four	Cause the zero can go in	4.0
Cause the zero can go in	Yeah All right	1.0
Yeah All right	Actually no	3.0
Wait	No	0.0
No	It would be one of the five	3.0
It would be one of the five	Cause it	0.0
Cause it	All right	0.0
All right	Well I think it would be one of the four because  Lets just take this one	1.0
Well I think it would be one of the four because  Lets just take this one	All right  so  this is one of the one of the four	1.0
All right  so  this is one of the one of the four	And the next one would be one of the five	1.0
And the next one would be one of the five	For some reason I dont know why but like the amount of possibilities that uh a three uh that three ones will come up	1.0
Mhmm	In with uh four places or something	3.0
Mhmm	But uh that thats the probability of winning on the fifth game	3.0
But uh that thats the probability of winning on the fifth game	I dont know why but if you if you win three games for four thats the probability of winning in the fourth	4.0
Are you saying that if the if the home team won three out of the exactly three out of the four then its in a position to win  if it wins the fifth game or	Its not in a position to win but if that the probability of winning three out of four	3.0
Uh huh	Is the probability of winning in in the in the fifth game	3.0
Is the probability of winning in in the in the fifth game	Of winning four out of five	1.0
Of winning four out of five	As not not yeah of winning having four of winning in the fifth game  I I wouldnt say four out of five	1.0
As not not yeah of winning having four of winning in the fifth game  I I wouldnt say four out of five	Yeah but if you won in the fifth game youd be winning four games of five	4.0
Yeah but if you won in the fifth game youd be winning four games of five	Thats just a way to express how thats one of four ways to express how the home team won three out of the four games	1.0
Well suppose were the home team and that weve won three out of the fiTeachert four games what do we think about the fifth game	The fifth game	0.0
Yeah	UM	0.0
UM	I just think we should refer to it as the home team because it switches back and forth so the home team could win four games in a row and you know it could actually be split two and two or something like that you know	4.0
I just think we should refer to it as the home team because it switches back and forth so the home team could win four games in a row and you know it could actually be split two and two or something like that you know	Its been bothering me	0.0
Its been bothering me	Cause that it brings a whole other problem in	3.0
Cause that it brings a whole other problem in	Well just pretend all the games were played on one field	1.0
Well just pretend all the games were played on one field	That way theres only one home	1.0
That way theres only one home	Well Im just saying that	0.0
Well Im just saying that	Well I	0.0
Well I	Thats a whole other problem	1.0
Thats a whole other problem	Team one team two	1.0
Team one team two	All right	0.0
All right	Instead of H and A	1.0
Okay	Now what was the question	2.0
So we won three games out of four	Right	0.0
What does it mean	What we think  Um	0.0
So what might we be thinking	Well the probability of winning tomorrow or the next game is a half	3.0
Ah ha	But the probability of the probability of you actually coming up you know winning on the fifth game is eight out of thirtytwo	3.0
Okay why eight	Eight why eight	0.0
Eight why eight	Well theres theres a probability of four out of  sixteen right	3.0
Well theres theres a probability of four out of  sixteen right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Four out of sixteen of winning fiTeachert three three games out of four	1.0
I see	So the probability of winning those three games are four out of sixteen	3.0
So the probability of winning those three games are four out of sixteen	Youre doing both of them	1.0
Youre doing both of them	Yeah  um  we were just talking about the away team	1.0
Yeah  um  we were just talking about the away team	All right I got it now	0.0
All right I got it now	The probability of you winning would be four out of sixteen	4.0
The probability of you winning would be four out of sixteen	Then to win the next game would be thats the probability of winning the next game	4.0
Then to win the next game would be thats the probability of winning the next game	Four out of thirtytwo	4.0
Four out of thirtytwo	Obviously theres two teams	4.0
Obviously theres two teams	So you double it here	4.0
So you double it here	You add another four out of thirtytwo	4.0
It does make sense I think	Cause I mean I think I was	0.0
Does that make sense to you	Well that was  seriously that was kind of yeah that was kind of the same thing that we were doing	1.0
Well that was  seriously that was kind of yeah that was kind of the same thing that we were doing	We were just using As and Hs	4.0
We were just using As and Hs	And then wed multiply them in the next part or like the by putting in the next slot	4.0
And then wed multiply them in the next part or like the by putting in the next slot	Thats how we got the bottom number	1.0
Thats how we got the bottom number	And thats how wed get the bottom number	1.0
And thats how wed get the bottom number	Yeah those are all our ideas together	1.0
Yeah those are all our ideas together	And A and Hs would be like thats a nice representation of all of our ideas	1.0
The probability of getting where we are	And the probability of winning in the next game	3.0
Are you all how did you look at it	I looked at it as	0.0
I looked at it as	I I really wasnt too sure	0.0
I I really wasnt too sure	Its all those numbeTeacher in the triangle	3.0
Its all those numbeTeacher in the triangle	It had some kind of relationship and after you said that now it makes sense	3.0
It had some kind of relationship and after you said that now it makes sense	Does it make sense to you	0.0
Okay now  okay so Mikes approach was to make this binary coding to code into these two digit binary numbeTeacher and to connect to Pascals triangle uh what were the other approaches that you did for this to get the eight over thirtytwo	Well Michael does the binary and we do it but just with the H and the A	1.0
Uh huh	Like in home and away	3.0
Like in home and away	And he just makes it look a lot nicer than we do	1.0
And he just makes it look a lot nicer than we do	We didnt tie it in with	1.0
We didnt tie it in with	We found the thirtytwo by multiplying  we didnt write all those thirtytwo out	1.0
We found the thirtytwo by multiplying  we didnt write all those thirtytwo out	Yeah like Brian did	1.0
Okay	And then we wrote the eight out which which would satisfy that	3.0
Could you show me how you wrote them	Thats how we did it like this	3.0
Did you just pick them at random or did you have uh did you have a way of	For four	0.0
For four	Well we have like an organized way like you bring the A through and	3.0
Could you show me	I didnt write them like that	3.0
Yeah	I did	0.0
I did	Um are we doing it for four four games	0.0
Um are we doing it for four four games	Five games or four games	2.0
Five games or four games	What do you want the two or the eight	2.0
Could somebody go to the board and do that	Knock youTeacherelf out	0.0
Knock youTeacherelf out	How many games four or five	2.0
How many games four or five	Well you start with four and then you could add another thing on the end to explain five better	3.0
Well you start with four and then you could add another thing on the end to explain five better	All the possibilities or just for one team winning	2.0
All the possibilities or just for one team winning	Just for just the eight right	1.0
In other words	Thats for five though  I dont know for the fiTeachert one the only way in four games theyd win is home home home home or away away away away	3.0
Mhmm	And thats where we got our two	3.0
And what about five games	And five games	0.0
And five games	Five games  four would have to be of one like letter	3.0
Five games  four would have to be of one like letter	We picked something to go at the end like away	1.0
We picked something to go at the end like away	And the other four would be the opposite	1.0
And the other four would be the opposite	Yeah and that just	1.0
So you didnt just pull them out of the air	No we didnt	3.0
So now  thats how we looked at the probability thats how you looked at the probability of winning the series in exactly five games was that right and you got eight over thirtytwo	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mhmm	1.0
Oneeighth	Hmhm	0.0
And eight thirtyseconds whats that	Onefourth	3.0
Onefourth	You just did it over sixteen we did two sixteens and that was four sixteens	1.0
Thats winning in six games	You add the  you add the other half	3.0
You add the  you add the other half	Add it	1.0
Add it	Multiply the other half to get sixtyfour	1.0
Multiply the other half to get sixtyfour	Multiply the other half and then	1.0
Uh huh	And in this one we wrote out the twenty	3.0
And in this one we wrote out the twenty	Ten	1.0
Ten	Ten and then we	1.0
You wrote out the ten	Yeah	0.0
Okay but Michaels approach was he could calculate the ten from Pascals Triangle	I think so	3.0
I think so	I tried to find something that  when youre writing out things theres so much room for error	3.0
I tried to find something that  when youre writing out things theres so much room for error	Oh there really is and you cant prove it	1.0
Oh there really is and you cant prove it	I know	1.0
I know	How do you know thats it	2.0
How do you know thats it	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Just thats it	0.0
Just thats it	I checked it five times already	0.0
What about the probability of winning the series in exactly seven games	Thats whats left over	3.0
Thats whats left over	Its the same	1.0
Its the same	Its the same thing	1.0
What do you mean	You just add those	3.0
You just add those	Cause the series has to end in either four five six or seven games	4.0
Okay	So if you add up four five and six	3.0
So if you add up four five and six	Five and six the only thing left is	1.0
Five and six the only thing left is	And subtract that from the whole	1.0
And subtract that from the whole	From the whole then	1.0
From the whole then	Then thats what you get	1.0
What if you had to calculate it directly	We can still do what he did	1.0
We can still do what he did	You still  you just continue on	1.0
You still  you just continue on	We could always do what he did	1.0
We could always do what he did	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Divide by half for the other line and go down	1.0
Wanna take a shot at it	h thats four games five games six games	3.0
h thats four games five games six games	Four or five six one more it would be  wouldnt it be	1.0
Four or five six one more it would be  wouldnt it be	Four or five	1.0
Four or five	One six fifteen  twenty right	1.0
One six fifteen  twenty right	I would say forty out of  onetwenty	1.0
I would say forty out of  onetwenty	One twentyeight which is	1.0
One twentyeight which is	I dont I dont know if that equals a whole	1.0
I dont I dont know if that equals a whole	It does	1.0
It does	Does it	1.0
Does it	Cause its twenty out of sixtyfour which was the same	4.0
Cause its twenty out of sixtyfour which was the same	As ten out of	1.0
As ten out of	Which is five out of sixteen	1.0
Which is five out of sixteen	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats what we got last time	1.0
Thats what we got last time	Its two out of sixteen four out of sixteen five and five	1.0
Its two out of sixteen four out of sixteen five and five	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And that equals sixteen	1.0
Are you checking that this agreed with the number you found earlier	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
How do you  could you show me that check	Well we added up the twosixteenths foursixteenths fivesixteenths	3.0
Well we added up the twosixteenths foursixteenths fivesixteenths	Thats what they reduce to	1.0
Mhmm	And we got	0.0
And we got	And that came to	0.0
And that came to	Six	3.0
Six	Eleven sixteens	1.0
Uh huh	And then we needed five more so you get sixteen sixteenths to get a whole	4.0
And then we needed five more so you get sixteen sixteenths to get a whole	Which is forty out of one twentyeight	1.0
Okay	Fivesixteenths	3.0
So you  in the cases where you actually sort of got in and had to do the calculations had to sort of slog through the calculations in one way or another youre treating the last game as special and then youre looking at the possibilities that could lead up to it is that fair	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mhmm	1.0
Um now youre assuming that the two teams are equally matched	Yes	0.0
And that was your explanation for the  the halves that came into it	Yeah but that that was	0.0
Yeah but that that was	It was just one out of two right	3.0
It was just one out of two right	Yeah that was that was stated in the in the problem too that they were equally matched	1.0
Okay	Yes	0.0
Yes	We didnt  I dont think we did but in the actual paper that we had written on	0.0
Did you wonder what you would do if uh they werent equally matched	That would be a problem	3.0
That would be a problem	No	1.0
No	Youd have	0.0
Youd have	Well how do you judge how much more  yeah how would you judge whos better and how much	2.0
Well how do you judge how much more  yeah how would you judge whos better and how much	Yeah how would you say that	2.0
Yeah how would you say that	Youd need a percent	1.0
Youd need a percent	Yes	1.0
Yes	How much better this team is than  better and by how much	1.0
How much better this team is than  better and by how much	How much	1.0
How much	You would need a fraction or a percentage	1.0
You would need a fraction or a percentage	Yeah I mean	1.0
Yeah I mean	Well if he just gives us a percentage  you know what Im saying	1.0
Well if he just gives us a percentage  you know what Im saying	No but if he just says that all right suppose team twos better	1.0
No but if he just says that all right suppose team twos better	By how much	2.0
By how much	Well thats what Im saying	1.0
Uh youre looking at maybe a whole season of games right	Mhmm	0.0
How might you get a handle on it	You just  you just change the bottom number cause	3.0
What would you look at	Cause we we look at their records and say	3.0
Cause we we look at their records and say	Just look yeah	1.0
Just look yeah	And you could find out how  it like shows you how much better Team A would be than Team B	1.0
And you could find out how  it like shows you how much better Team A would be than Team B	Thats kind of like a opinion	1.0
Thats kind of like a opinion	You think its better because the records	1.0
You think its better because the records	Yeah but I mean where they played and	1.0
Yeah but I mean where they played and	I would be better because I	0.0
I would be better because I	Yeah you really dont know	0.0
Yeah you really dont know	Anything can happen	0.0
Anything can happen	Then that way each team doesnt have a fifty percent	1.0
Then that way each team doesnt have a fifty percent	It dont matter after thirty one to one that one champion by one	1.0
It dont matter after thirty one to one that one champion by one	Exactly	1.0
Exactly	Yeah its just	1.0
Yeah its just	I mean if you make purpose like	1.0
I mean if you make purpose like	A concrete decision	1.0
A concrete decision	Its kind of hard to put a value	1.0
Its kind of hard to put a value	Uh that teams better than that team because they have a better record	4.0
Uh that teams better than that team because they have a better record	Well I think the other team is better because they got a better pitcher	4.0
Well I think the other team is better because they got a better pitcher	Uh huh	1.0
Uh huh	Its hard to  but if you were to say all right forget that the ones  one little win forty forty times  forty percent more than the other then   You undeTeachertand what Im saying	1.0
Its hard to  but if you were to say all right forget that the ones  one little win forty forty times  forty percent more than the other then   You undeTeachertand what Im saying	Then regardless of what the team  like you could get us a percentage	1.0
Then regardless of what the team  like you could get us a percentage	Sure you could do it but	1.0
Um how often do you do you think that the teams are even evenly matched	Rarely	3.0
Rarely	Probably not	1.0
Probably not	Yeah but thats left up to opinion	1.0
Yeah but thats left up to opinion	I mean you could say that uh	1.0
I mean you could say that uh	Some teams just dont do good  dont do well against the other teams because they take it for granted and then they play	1.0
But would it be fair to  money most of the time	Thats why they have lines	3.0
Thats why they have lines	Yeah theres never  anyway	1.0
Cause youre saying youre saying that in general people have views that one team is likely to be better than the other	Well thats where the whole live situation comes in	3.0
Well thats where the whole live situation comes in	Thats why they try to make it even	1.0
Thats why they try to make it even	You figure that  this team is gonna touchdown better	1.0
You figure that  this team is gonna touchdown better	And thats thats	0.0
And thats thats	And theyre usually  I dont know what they do but theyre usually right on dude let me tell ya	1.0
And theyre usually  I dont know what they do but theyre usually right on dude let me tell ya	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Its pretty good  Cause its always like  they just	1.0
Its pretty good  Cause its always like  they just	They have to	1.0
They have to	Like say like if  my teams playing s team my team will be  by say seven points	1.0
Like say like if  my teams playing s team my team will be  by say seven points	If I dont if I dont beat em by more than seven then people at the  even know I won	1.0
If I dont if I dont beat em by more than seven then people at the  even know I won	Its like giving me a seven nothing	1.0
Its like giving me a seven nothing	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Exactly	1.0
how would that effect it	You have more of a chance to win that  in the third games	3.0
You have more of a chance to win that  in the third games	Well if theyre twice as likely then instead of multiplying it by a half it would be like two thirds	4.0
Well if theyre twice as likely then instead of multiplying it by a half it would be like two thirds	Two thirds	1.0
Two thirds	AA  I mean HHA	1.0
AA  I mean HHA	Thats another thing like you would have like your  however many combinations	1.0
Thats another thing like you would have like your  however many combinations	All right how many  like sixteen games you know like the fiTeachert one	1.0
Mhmm	There was sixteen for one team and sixteen for another	4.0
There was sixteen for one team and sixteen for another	And she would multiply that one sixteen by two because it will have  it will happen twice as many times as the other one	4.0
Winning the series in exactly four games	Just like you said	3.0
Why dont we just	What is it	2.0
What is it	Home home away away home away home	3.0
Home home away away home away home	OH oh you have to	0.0
OH oh you have to	Just four games	3.0
Just four games	The fiTeachert  when theyre equally matched you have um the home team has a one sixteen chance of winning	4.0
The fiTeachert  when theyre equally matched you have um the home team has a one sixteen chance of winning	A  one eighth chance and the other one has a one eighth chance	4.0
A  one eighth chance and the other one has a one eighth chance	You would add them together	4.0
You would add them together	But this one eighth with um	4.0
But this one eighth with um	no its one sixteenth	4.0
no its one sixteenth	One sixteenth	4.0
One sixteenth	One sixteenth	4.0
One sixteenth	Now lets say this is the better team	4.0
Yeah	They have twice  they come out twice as many times as this	3.0
They have twice  they come out twice as many times as this	So you would um	0.0
So you would um	Multiply by two	1.0
Multiply by two	Just double it	1.0
Just double it	Just double it so it would be a two sixteenth chance of	4.0
Just double it so it would be a two sixteenth chance of	Just add another one sixteenth	1.0
Just add another one sixteenth	Add another one sixteenth and the probability of uh	1.0
Add another one sixteenth and the probability of uh	It would be over  wed have forty eight then	1.0
It would be over  wed have forty eight then	What was the question	2.0
What was the question	Probably that	0.0
Suppose we believe that  say the home team is twice as likely to win any given game as the away team whats the probability of the World Series that the World Series would take exactly four games	Three out of sixteen	3.0
How do you	You cant do three out of sixteen cause	3.0
You cant do three out of sixteen cause	All right	0.0
How do you see that	I got three out of sixteen and it makes a little more sense because three out of sixteen is bigger than two out of sixteen	4.0
I got three out of sixteen and it makes a little more sense because three out of sixteen is bigger than two out of sixteen	Now if you	0.0
Now if you	Yeah but wouldnt it be the same because the home team plays twice and the away team plays  twice at home	4.0
Yeah but wouldnt it be the same because the home team plays twice and the away team plays  twice at home	So you figure they have the same advantage	1.0
So you figure they have the same advantage	But if  if one team is better than the other	1.0
But if  if one team is better than the other	Were not saying that were saying that the home team is twice as likely	1.0
Were not saying that were saying that the home team is twice as likely	You said the home team	1.0
You said the home team	No the  at their home stadium all right	1.0
No the  at their home stadium all right	Or a specific team	1.0
Or a specific team	Just say Team A and B dont worry about home	1.0
Just say Team A and B dont worry about home	Then youre saying  yeah then youre saying  well thats like every  question because like if you ask  differently its all different	4.0
Then youre saying  yeah then youre saying  well thats like every  question because like if you ask  differently its all different	All right you have Team A what was more likely to win	1.0
All right you have Team A what was more likely to win	All right all right well	0.0
All right all right well	So therefore its gonna be so Team A is gonna  they have a better shot at winning it for  than the other one	1.0
Yeah	So obviously its gonna be a little bigger	3.0
All right all right	So like I  so the better team has a two out of sixteen chance of winning	3.0
So like I  so the better team has a two out of sixteen chance of winning	And the  also has a sixteen	1.0
And the  also has a sixteen	Yeah	1.0
Are you sure	It would be  am I sure	0.0
It would be  am I sure	No	0.0
No	I just said it	0.0
Okay	Cause that one event of having Team A winning four times in a row is twice as likely  twice as more likely to happen to us	4.0
Cause that one event of having Team A winning four times in a row is twice as likely  twice as more likely to happen to us	The other team	4.0
Um if the teams are equally matched whats the probability of Team A winning one game	fiftyfifty	3.0
What would be the numbeTeacher	One out of two	3.0
One out of two	One out of two	1.0
Are you reading the fraction 216 as symbolizing two out of sixteen	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
Okay so now suppose Team A is twice as good as Team B whats the probability of Team A winning one game	Two out of three	3.0
Two out of three	Mmhhmm	1.0
Mmhhmm	They have twice the chance so it leaves three chances to win	1.0
They have twice the chance so it leaves three chances to win	So would that be three out of seventeen then	1.0
So would that be three out of seventeen then	Is that what youre saying	1.0
Is that what youre saying	Like you say how you go from one to two to two to three	1.0
Like you say how you go from one to two to two to three	Yeah but if youre going from	1.0
Yeah but if youre going from	Cause youre doing  look if theres a chance of Team A winning one game is two out of three winning game two is another two out of three	4.0
Cause youre doing  look if theres a chance of Team A winning one game is two out of three winning game two is another two out of three	So it would be what Four out of nine of winning the fiTeachert two games	4.0
So it would be what Four out of nine of winning the fiTeachert two games	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then	0.0
And then	Two out of three again	1.0
Two out of three again	Would be eight out of twentyseven	1.0
Would be eight out of twentyseven	Eight out of twentyseven and then two out of three again for winning four in the row	1.0
Eight out of twentyseven and then two out of three again for winning four in the row	Which would be	1.0
Which would be	Sixteen out of eightyone	1.0
Sixteen out of eightyone	Or seven times three	1.0
Or seven times three	Yeah so it was a	1.0
Yeah so it was a	Sixteen out of eightyone	1.0
Sixteen out of eightyone	Sixteen eightyone thats not gonna reduce	1.0
Sixteen eightyone thats not gonna reduce	Thats with just Team A winning	1.0
Thats with just Team A winning	Team A winning Team A winning	1.0
Team A winning Team A winning	Four in a row	1.0
Four in a row	And then	0.0
And then	FiTeachert four and then you do the other thing	1.0
FiTeachert four and then you do the other thing	Then it would be one one one	1.0
Then it would be one one one	One out of three	1.0
One out of three	One times  one out of three times   it would be one eightyone wouldnt it	1.0
One times  one out of three times   it would be one eightyone wouldnt it	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	Because one  not changing	4.0
Because one  not changing	It would be seventeen out of eightyone	1.0
It would be seventeen out of eightyone	Yeah seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone its gonna be one and four	1.0
Yeah seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone its gonna be one and four	Its gonna be over in four games	1.0
Its gonna be over in four games	A sixteen out of eightyone shot that team  the better team thats	1.0
A sixteen out of eightyone shot that team  the better team thats	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	twice as betters gonna win in those games	1.0
twice as betters gonna win in those games	And one out of eighty one chance that it  twice as bad	1.0
And then finally the seventeen and the sixteen	Cause the probability is   you said Team A is twice as better as Team One	4.0
Cause the probability is   you said Team A is twice as better as Team One	So the chance of Team A winning and winning one game at random is two  one  two out of three	4.0
So the chance of Team A winning and winning one game at random is two  one  two out of three	Right	1.0
Right	Cause they have twice as	4.0
Cause they have twice as	Cause they have twice twice as much shot as winning a game as Team B does	4.0
Cause they have twice twice as much shot as winning a game as Team B does	So if for every two games Team A wins Team B will win one game	4.0
Okay	So its two out of three	3.0
Okay so its like  it looks like youre taking the games in groups of three then when youre thinking of that	Yes	0.0
Okay	And then another game is two out of three again	3.0
And then another game is two out of three again	multiplying together	3.0
multiplying together	Just like we did like the one half	1.0
OK	in the same situation	3.0
in the same situation	Thats how we got  and then we do that four times to get the probability that Team A would win	1.0
Thats how we got  and then we do that four times to get the probability that Team A would win	And then since the other one is only one third if you multiply one third times one third times one third one third before the top number is just one times one times one times one	4.0
Uh huh	Saying three to the fourth equals eightyone	4.0
Saying three to the fourth equals eightyone	And so that would be one out of eightyone and then we add that one to the sixteen out of eightyone and you  eightyone	4.0
Is that right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mhmm	1.0
So its not like the double that you did before	Mhmm	0.0
Right	Thats why we did two out of three	4.0
Thats why we did two out of three	Thats why we did that yeah yeah	1.0
One or the other of the two teams winning the World Series in five games in exactly five games	Same situation where the other team is twice as better	0.0
Same situation where the other team is twice as better	Is Team A twice as better as Team One	0.0
Is twice as likely to win at giving  the second team	So for the next shot you figure that have a  at a  for the fourth game two out of the the  they have two out of three chance of winning that game	3.0
So for the next shot you figure that have a  at a  for the fourth game two out of the the  they have two out of three chance of winning that game	Why dont we just do what he did I guess somehow	1.0
Why dont we just do what he did I guess somehow	With that team	1.0
With that team	The triangle	1.0
The triangle	No like	1.0
No like	The triangles not gonna work with this	1.0
The triangles not gonna work with this	Its not	1.0
Its not	I know	1.0
I know	Would you multiply just by two thirds	1.0
Would you multiply just by two thirds	Is that what we did	1.0
Is that what we did	Seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone times two thirds	4.0
Seventeen out of  seventeen out of eightyone times two thirds	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Seventeen eightyone times onethird	4.0
Seventeen eightyone times onethird	And then add that	4.0
And then add that	would be  yeah well seventeen eightyone times two thirds will be what	2.0
would be  yeah well seventeen eightyone times two thirds will be what	Seventeen times  seventeen times two will be uh	1.0
Seventeen times  seventeen times two will be uh	Thirtyfour	1.0
Thirtyfour	Thats the probability of winning	1.0
Thats the probability of winning	You have to take a	0.0
You have to take a	And then we have to add	1.0
And then we have to add	You have to take the probability of now  thats a  out of four games  need the probability of three out of four	1.0
You have to take the probability of now  thats a  out of four games  need the probability of three out of four	And then adding the last part in	1.0
And then adding the last part in	Because you have the  that that  sixteen eightyone or that seventeen out of	4.0
Because you have the  that that  sixteen eightyone or that seventeen out of	Thats winning four	1.0
Thats winning four	Thats winning four games	1.0
Thats winning four games	And you cant play another game because someones already	4.0
And you cant play another game because someones already	Then you have to subtract those too	1.0
Then you have to subtract those too	You need you need you need to find out the probability of three out of four games instead of you know out of four	1.0
You need you need you need to find out the probability of three out of four games instead of you know out of four	And its not seventeen eightyone or anything	1.0
And its not seventeen eightyone or anything	What is it	2.0
What is it	I dont know	2.0
How would you go after this	Like what are you	0.0
How would you go after it	got the probability of winning three out of four games	3.0
got the probability of winning three out of four games	With Team A having twice a better chance of winning as Team B	3.0
With Team A having twice a better chance of winning as Team B	Like three games	1.0
Want to talk for a while and Ill join you in a couple of minutes	So if its fiftyfifty  three out of four whats that	2.0
So if its fiftyfifty  three out of four whats that	Half one half one half	1.0
Half one half one half	You couldnt write that in possibilities  could you	1.0
You couldnt write that in possibilities  could you	See I dont know if its two thirds like that	1.0
See I dont know if its two thirds like that	I mean it makes sense but in a game	1.0
I mean it makes sense but in a game	Theres like	0.0
Theres like	That made sense though	1.0
That made sense though	Theres one  theres two	1.0
Theres one  theres two	Four in a row made sense	1.0
Four in a row made sense	Yeah I dont know	2.0
Yeah I dont know	Im still on this whole two thirds business	1.0
Im still on this whole two thirds business	Cause the other game I mean all right out of	1.0
Cause the other game I mean all right out of	What are you saying like Team A	1.0
What are you saying like Team A	This is probably three out of four if its fiftyfifty	1.0
This is probably three out of four if its fiftyfifty	Do you	0.0
Do you	What three games out of four	2.0
What three games out of four	Thats fiftyfifty	1.0
Thats fiftyfifty	You wrote Team A and Team H	1.0
You wrote Team A and Team H	Lets say they win one game Team A won two games	1.0
Lets say they win one game Team A won two games	Its not  its eight right	1.0
Its not  its eight right	Eight out of thirtytwo	1.0
Eight out of thirtytwo	The A Team	1.0
The A Team	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It is two it is two out of three  they win they win two	1.0
It is two it is two out of three  they win they win two	They win two	1.0
They win two	Its like having this H or J	1.0
Its like having this H or J	Or the other way around	1.0
Or the other way around	Half	1.0
Half	Show me what this is	1.0
Show me what this is	All right if they had  if three times is	1.0
All right if they had  if three times is	Thats what I was thinking	1.0
Thats what I was thinking	And theres a two thirds chance of that happening or one third one third one third	1.0
And theres a two thirds chance of that happening or one third one third one third	One third one third one third and then switch it up  were at two third two third two third one third	1.0
One third one third one third and then switch it up  were at two third two third two third one third	Yeah so it would be  and we need  four of those right	1.0
Yeah so it would be  and we need  four of those right	Eightyone  two over eightyone	1.0
Eightyone  two over eightyone	Then four of them right	1.0
Then four of them right	Because then we put the A over here	4.0
Because then we put the A over here	Yeah and then you figure that out of all those two eighty ones	1.0
Yeah and then you figure that out of all those two eighty ones	And then the other way is	1.0
And then the other way is	And thatll be two times	1.0
And thatll be two times	Thats eighty or eightyone	1.0
Thats eighty or eightyone	And then theres four of those	1.0
And then theres four of those	So thatll be three  yeah	1.0
So thatll be three  yeah	So thatll be three out of eightyone	1.0
So thatll be three out of eightyone	So it	0.0
So it	Add that so its forty out of eightyone	1.0
Add that so its forty out of eightyone	All right so say forty out of eightyone chance thats almost half a chance its gonna run a fifth game	1.0
All right so say forty out of eightyone chance thats almost half a chance its gonna run a fifth game	Well that makes sense though	1.0
Well that makes sense though	Because the one  manage	4.0
Because the one  manage	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So its going to be	0.0
So its going to be	to seven	1.0
to seven	Chances are chances are the high amounts are gonna be in the early games	1.0
Chances are chances are the high amounts are gonna be in the early games	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Well thats half And that one was eight thirtytwo	1.0
Well thats half And that one was eight thirtytwo	Which ones are thirty	2.0
Which ones are thirty	Yeah but the other side has an advantage its almost twice	1.0
Yeah but the other side has an advantage its almost twice	Not that much of an advantage	1.0
Not that much of an advantage	Yeah they twice as good	1.0
Yeah they twice as good	Twice as good	1.0
Twice as good	Twice as good	1.0
Twice as good	Three out of thirtytwo I mean	1.0
Three out of thirtytwo I mean	I mean if you even look at	0.0
I mean if you even look at	Cause look  if you look at it its not supposed to go to seven games cause then you need four and three instead of four and two	4.0
Cause look  if you look at it its not supposed to go to seven games cause then you need four and three instead of four and two	I mean but	0.0
I mean but	It could go up to seven	1.0
It could go up to seven	Yeah it could	1.0
Yeah it could	I know its not its highly unlikely	1.0
I know its not its highly unlikely	It  s less likely	1.0
It  s less likely	Its still likely	1.0
Its still likely	Less likely and that one is only eight out of	1.0
Less likely and that one is only eight out of	Thats not gonna be zero	1.0
Thats not gonna be zero	And if you look at it in terms of eightyone I mean eight out of thirtytwo thats like almost  its more  if you put it in terms of eightyone	4.0
And if you look at it in terms of eightyone I mean eight out of thirtytwo thats like almost  its more  if you put it in terms of eightyone	Because eightyone	4.0
Because eightyone	Want to do this out of five games then	1.0
Want to do this out of five games then	Hm	0.0
Hm	Lets see what it looks like	1.0
Lets see what it looks like	See if were  on the same	1.0
See if were  on the same	This will be different	1.0
This will be different	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So the one team has to win three games	1.0
So the one team has to win three games	one three	1.0
one three	We screwed this one up	1.0
We screwed this one up	Theres got to be less than theres got to be less than eightyone	1.0
Theres got to be less than theres got to be less than eightyone	up isnt there	1.0
up isnt there	Theres another H isnt there	1.0
Theres another H isnt there	Well you look at it	0.0
Well you look at it	Are we still winning those	1.0
Are we still winning those	Thats what I was gonna say	1.0
Thats what I was gonna say	No ones winning this	1.0
No ones winning this	You know what I mean	1.0
You know what I mean	Have to get another H	4.0
Have to get another H	So we just did eightyfour games and it should have been  its over eightyone times three	4.0
So we just did eightyfour games and it should have been  its over eightyone times three	Fortythree	4.0
Fortythree	Two fortythree	1.0
Two fortythree	Umdoes this make more sense then	1.0
Umdoes this make more sense then	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Sixteen  sixteen out of  did you get a half or something	1.0
Sixteen  sixteen out of  did you get a half or something	Not its not	1.0
Not its not	Thats cause we did cause we did  this and thats only three games out of	4.0
Thats cause we did cause we did  this and thats only three games out of	Actually its almost a half chance of winning three out of four games	4.0
Actually its almost a half chance of winning three out of four games	Then multiply that by	4.0
Then multiply that by	I did like for the  before we had Team A  when it was a fiftyfifty chance they had a four out of sixteen chance of winning three games out of four	1.0
I did like for the  before we had Team A  when it was a fiftyfifty chance they had a four out of sixteen chance of winning three games out of four	Right	1.0
Right	You know that	1.0
You know that	The four and that	1.0
The four and that	And then um but this is the better team	1.0
And then um but this is the better team	It has a  for every one game this team wins this team wins too	1.0
It has a  for every one game this team wins this team wins too	You know what Im saying	1.0
You know what Im saying	Like the twice  to win	1.0
Like the twice  to win	Sixtyfour	1.0
Sixtyfour	So you  theyre probably now eight sixtyfour	4.0
So you  theyre probably now eight sixtyfour	Its double	4.0
Its double	And then to win the last game its still twothirds cause one is two thirds more than the other	4.0
And then to win the last game its still twothirds cause one is two thirds more than the other	This one comes out to eight	4.0
This one comes out to eight	Why is that one two thirds	2.0
Why is that one two thirds	I thought this one was better	1.0
I thought this one was better	Um yeah	1.0
Um yeah	That would be four to   This is sixteen	1.0
That would be four to   This is sixteen	Uh this would be twenty out of fortyeight	1.0
Uh this would be twenty out of fortyeight	Yeah twenty out of fortyeight	1.0
Yeah twenty out of fortyeight	Itll be over in five days	1.0
Itll be over in five days	Whats  games	2.0
Whats  games	Four games what	2.0
Four games what	Which one is	2.0
Which one is	Yes	1.0
Yes	All right	0.0
All right	Fiftyone out of	1.0
Fiftyone out of	Probably just when you  winning winning the fifth game itll be twenty fortyeighty	1.0
Probably just when you  winning winning the fifth game itll be twenty fortyeighty	Um the probability that I was about Team A won won those twenty games  sixteen out of twenty	1.0
Um the probability that I was about Team A won won those twenty games  sixteen out of twenty	Okay	0.0
Okay	Probably just when you  winning winning the fifth game itll be twenty fortyeighty	1.0
Probably just when you  winning winning the fifth game itll be twenty fortyeighty	Um the probability that I was about Team A won won those twenty games  sixteen out of twenty	1.0
Um the probability that I was about Team A won won those twenty games  sixteen out of twenty	Okay	0.0
Okay	A nd the other one will be four out of twenty	1.0
A nd the other one will be four out of twenty	But the questions not this	1.0
But the questions not this	Its this one right here	1.0
Its this one right here	I dont think so	1.0
I dont think so	before the guy told me to stop	1.0
before the guy told me to stop	told him I couldnt	1.0
told him I couldnt	I was saying that before and he was like oh lets think of something else	1.0
I was saying that before and he was like oh lets think of something else	So its probably wrong	1.0
So its probably wrong	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I cant concentrate	0.0
I cant concentrate	Just see where that leads	0.0

And we  this is what we got	Theres a five game series right	3.0
Theres a five game series right	When this is like one way that one team could win	3.0
Could you do this at the board	No	0.0
No	Yeah	0.0
I dont believe you	Can I erase this	0.0

Yeah	This	0.0
This	We used five heads	0.0
We used five heads	This was one of the ways of winning uh the world series	3.0
Uh huh	And then since Team As twice as likely to win as Team B the chances of this happening is two thirds	4.0
And then since Team As twice as likely to win as Team B the chances of this happening is two thirds	And this is one third	4.0
Cause youre gonna talk in As and Bs	As the better one	3.0
As the better one	Why dont you make B better	0.0
Why dont you make B better	A  better	0.0
A  better	Go for it man	0.0
Go for it man	A better	0.0
A better	And then just multiply that across right	3.0
And then just multiply that across right	Cause thats the  the probability of this happening	4.0
Why do you multiply this time	The same reason the last time	3.0

I really do I	Every time youre putting two probabilities because like I said were always  well not always but like we  whether we know it we have to multiply em	4.0
Every time youre putting two probabilities because like I said were always  well not always but like we  whether we know it we have to multiply em	When theyre constructed as	1.0
When theyre constructed as	So why should this be different than any other case	2.0
Last time you actually showed me why you multiplied	I dont even want to show you this time	0.0
I dont even want to show you this time	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How did we do that	2.0
How did we do that	So just remember what we said	0.0
So just remember what we said	Its different	3.0
That was a different situation where the two teams were equally matched	But how is that different	2.0
But how is that different	Its just  were just doing	0.0
Its just  were just doing	There was a fifty percent chance of each thing happening and we multiplied it this time which was sixty sixty	4.0
There was a fifty percent chance of each thing happening and we multiplied it this time which was sixty sixty	Thirtythree	1.0
Thirtythree	And were still multiplying	1.0
And were still multiplying	Were changing anything but the chance of the team winning	4.0
Were changing anything but the chance of the team winning	So it cant be any different	4.0
Go on go on and explain the rest of this	All right	0.0
Okay	If you multiply it across you get two out of  what was it  two two eightythree	4.0
If you multiply it across you get two out of  what was it  two two eightythree	Two fortythree of that happening	4.0
Two fortythree of that happening	And then you can have the A in each of the four places	4.0
Uh huh	You cant have it in the last cause then one  four game series and its over	4.0
You cant have it in the last cause then one  four game series and its over	So you multiply this four times	4.0
Wait youre doing this youre doing this for a five game series or a four games series	Five game series	3.0
Five game series	You just add that	1.0
What would you do for a four game series	You would multiply it three times	3.0
You would multiply it three times	Youre adding that	1.0
Yeah but what would you do for the four game series	You	0.0
You	Four games its either    remember the other one we did before	3.0
Four games its either    remember the other one we did before	Remember he was he was watching us	0.0
Oh yeah you were here	You would add that four times	3.0
Lets go over the five game series	yeah	0.0
So youve looked at one possible five game series where B can  where B comes out	Mhmm	0.0
Is that the only way	can happen one two three or four its eight out of two fortythree	3.0
can happen one two three or four its eight out of two fortythree	It cant happen in the last one	3.0
You mean that the A could be in one out of four places	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
So then so there are four possibilities	Yeah so it would be eight out of two hundred and fortythree that Team A  Team B would win	3.0
And in each of those cases were the As in a different place  Are you taking the same product in the fractures	Yes	0.0
You are	Wait wait what did you say	0.0
Okay suppose A won the second game instead of the fiTeachert so it would be A	It would be the same thing  B  A	3.0
It would be the same thing  B  A	Its gonna be the same	1.0
Will there be a two thirds under the B at the beginning	No  same as A	3.0
No  same as A	The two thirds would be here	1.0
The two thirds would be here	Its the other way around	1.0
Uh huh	So instead of just moving the two thirds	3.0
So instead of just moving the two thirds	The  matteTeacher because the other game is	4.0
Are you saying you would you get the same product with the two third in those different places	Yes why wouldnt you	2.0
Yes why wouldnt you	Cause you still have four one thirds and one two thirds	4.0
Why would you	Its like A times B times C	3.0
Its like A times B times C	Youre multiplying the same numbeTeacher except in different order	1.0
Okay	So that would be eight out of two fortythree	3.0
Okay	Its working now right	0.0
So	If Team A won the four games right	3.0
Yeah	It would just be  I love that noise	0.0
It would just be  I love that noise	Like that	0.0
oh	And then when you multiply that twice you get sixteen out of two fortythree	4.0
And then when you multiply that twice you get sixteen out of two fortythree	And for the same reason as before theres  it can be in four different places	4.0
Mhmm	Then that would be sixtyfour and forty three	3.0
Then that would be sixtyfour and forty three	Add them together	3.0
Add them together	Then you add em together and you get seventytwo out of two fortythree	1.0
What	That reduces right	3.0
Ahhh	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Seventytwo is a multiple of nine right	3.0
Seventytwo is a multiple of nine right	Two fortythree out of	1.0
Two fortythree out of	Is a multiple of nine	1.0
Is a multiple of nine	Whats uh two fortythrees	2.0
Whats uh two fortythrees	Bring it over into five and six	1.0
Bring it over into five and six	Whats nine times  whats two	2.0
Whats nine times  whats two	Who cares	0.0
I do	Its always  its probably come up in the same  order	3.0
What does it come out to be	Twentyseven	3.0
Twentyseven	Twentyseven	1.0
Twentyseven	Divide that by nine	1.0
Divide that by nine	Twentyseven	1.0
Twentyseven	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Twenty seven out of	1.0
Twenty seven out of	Eight	1.0
Eight	The other one was eight out of	1.0
The other one was eight out of	The other one was what	2.0
The other one was what	Eight out of thirtytwo	1.0
Oh	Thats something	0.0
Why did you whistle	Im excited	0.0
So thats a five game series	for a week	0.0
Other	I was just guessing	0.0
I was just guessing	Maybe the top number stays the same and the bottom numbeTeacher the one that changes	3.0
Maybe the top number stays the same and the bottom numbeTeacher the one that changes	Im not willing to prove that because I dont know why	2.0
Im not willing to prove that because I dont know why	Yeah you cant prove it	1.0
Tell me why youre guessing then	Guessing	0.0
Guessing	It happens	0.0
It happens	Because the five games series has eight out of x or whatever	4.0
Because the five games series has eight out of x or whatever	And the other one has eight out of another number	4.0
And the other one has eight out of another number	So Im just thinking maybe	4.0
So Im just thinking maybe	We get the four game series  on there	1.0
We get the four game series  on there	Seventeen out of eightyone	1.0
Seventeen out of eightyone	Maybe thats a coincidence maybe its not	1.0
Maybe thats a coincidence maybe its not	I hope its not	1.0
Okay so what about a six game series	They didnt tell us	0.0
They didnt tell us	Check it out	0.0
You want to check it out	What is three new things	2.0
What is three new things	Twentyseven right	3.0
Twentyseven right	is twentyseven	3.0
I always thought so	third is eightytwo	3.0
Two to   isnt that eight	Its eight	3.0
Its eight	A ll right	0.0
A ll right	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	Im not good	0.0
Okay	No whats thirtytwo	2.0
No whats thirtytwo	Its two times  fifth	3.0
Its two times  fifth	Two four	1.0
Two four	Eight	1.0
Eight	Eight	1.0
Eight	Sixteen	1.0
Sixteen	Sixteen	1.0
Sixteen	Im bad with math	0.0
Im bad with math	In my head	0.0
Now I want to come back to the multiplication	Mhmm	0.0
Okay	Its like that  in the fiTeachert place	0.0
Its like that  in the fiTeachert place	Like  two things right	3.0
Like  two things right	Oh this	1.0
Oh this	Yeah cause	1.0
Yeah	But like you have a fifty percent chance of winning and you have a fifty percent chance of winning right and you multiply them together	4.0
But like you have a fifty percent chance of winning and you have a fifty percent chance of winning right and you multiply them together	Right	0.0
Now what I remember here was that  it was like we  we chose to look at a simpler situation which is what happens in two games in a row right	Mhmm	0.0
That way	anything	0.0
anything	You havent said anything in a while huh	0.0
I want to hear from everybody	I want to hear from her	0.0
I want to hear from her	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	The probabilities of what	2.0
The probabilities of what	Of the team winning both those games	3.0
What are the probabilities of those things happening	In the fiTeachert game we may have a two thirds chance of winning right	3.0
Right	They always tell us to multiply	0.0
They always tell us to multiply	They never tell us why	0.0
They never tell us why	Then you tell us  why and we dont know	0.0
Am I wrong to wonder	No	0.0
No	No thats	0.0
No thats	Youre asking us why were doing something thats what you told us to do	0.0
Youre asking us why were doing something thats what you told us to do	If you say that	0.0
Are you curious	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
No	If it works man	0.0
If it works man	But only if someone would tell us once	0.0
How do you know it works	Well because it worked for this one	4.0
Well because it worked for this one	Cause its the same reasoning	4.0
Cause its the same reasoning	Yeah were assuming if it works with that one	4.0
Yeah were assuming if it works with that one	It only changes the percentage of the chance to win	1.0
It only changes the percentage of the chance to win	Okay	0.0
Okay	Youre assuming it	0.0
Youre assuming it	Um is it is it a safe assumption	0.0
Um is it is it a safe assumption	How would you how would you	0.0
How would you how would you	Its not a safe assumption	3.0
Its not a safe assumption	When when multiplying uh we need to flip two coins	1.0
When when multiplying uh we need to flip two coins	multiplying those two Is that the same question youre asking us	0.0
multiplying those two Is that the same question youre asking us	Do you undeTeachertand why you multiply by half	1.0
Do you undeTeachertand why you multiply by half	Yeah Hes	0.0
Yeah Hes	By two halves	1.0
Im not worried Im not worried when the chances are fiftyfifty	PeTeacheronally I would not	3.0
But Im wondering what happens when theyre not	When you when you  when the chances are fiftyfifty you multiply probably the fiTeachert one coming and probably the second one	4.0
Right	Now it will make a difference if one  is different	3.0
Now it will make a difference if one  is different	Youre just multiplying	1.0
Youre just multiplying	If youve got a fixed	1.0
If youve got a fixed	Youve still got those	1.0
Youve still got those	From the fiTeachert one and you would still do the  just that ones different wouldnt change anything	1.0
From the fiTeachert one and you would still do the  just that ones different wouldnt change anything	He just wants to straighten out the possibilities and	1.0
He just wants to straighten out the possibilities and	Why	2.0
Why	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Why  I mean you  the fiTeachert event the fiTeachert coin coming up heads the second event  the second coin coming up heads	1.0
Why  I mean you  the fiTeachert event the fiTeachert coin coming up heads the second event  the second coin coming up heads	Half and half is one in four chance of them both happening you know the same time	1.0
Half and half is one in four chance of them both happening you know the same time	So if one coin comes out has more than the other why wouldnt you multiply that	2.0
So if one coin comes out has more than the other why wouldnt you multiply that	I mean you undeTeachertand	1.0
I mean you undeTeachertand	If you have  if youre doing one half youre still multiplying both probabilities	1.0
Is that okay	Thats fine	0.0
Thats fine	Thats fine	0.0
Do you all know about World Series	Mhmm	0.0
Mhmm	Yeah	0.0
Did you know that Romina because I didnt know that	No yeah I know that	0.0
But you know we want you to be able to talk to each other in any way you want	Couldnt we do like a you know how we do like	0.0
Would it be better if I left you alone	Thats what Im saying	0.0
Okay Im going to leave you alone	hey can go all seven or they could go all four	3.0
hey can go all seven or they could go all four	So it would be A A A A and B 8 8 8 Team A and Team B	3.0
So it would be A A A A and B 8 8 8 Team A and Team B	Wait whats the   wait wait	0.0
Wait whats the   wait wait	So those are the only possibilities for four	1.0
So those are the only possibilities for four	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	So in  four games would it be like onehalf of a chance	1.0
So in  four games would it be like onehalf of a chance	Or would we have to write it out with  using aU seven	1.0
Or would we have to write it out with  using aU seven	See I think that its the hardest to win it in four games	1.0
See I think that its the hardest to win it in four games	Four games	1.0
Four games	Definitely the hardest	1.0
Definitely the hardest	Yeah exactly	1.0
Yeah exactly	So it wouldnt be onehalf	1.0
So it wouldnt be onehalf	Isnt it the odds   the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game	1.0
Isnt it the odds   the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game times the odds of winning one game	Thats what Im thinking	1.0
Thats what Im thinking	Look its a fifty percent chance of winning the first game	1.0
Look its a fifty percent chance of winning the first game	Alright	0.0
Alright	Onehalf	1.0
Onehalf	So its like half times a half   no wait   remember the odds get harder to win two in a row like a coin flip	1.0
So its like half times a half   no wait   remember the odds get harder to win two in a row like a coin flip	Yeah so thats	1.0
Yeah so thats	Yeah thats how you do it  a half times a half times a half times a half	4.0
Yeah thats how you do it  a half times a half times a half times a half	Alright	0.0
Alright	If thats the case what is  it	2.0
If thats the case what is  it	Four hold on   four times	1.0
Four hold on   four times	Thats sixteen	1.0
Thats sixteen	Is it one thirtytwo	1.0

Two times two is four times two is eight	Three times three	1.0
Three times three	Oh never mind I get it	0.0
Oh never mind I get it	Now would you have for five games like would it be like that	1.0
Now would you have for five games like would it be like that	Hopefully the odds of winning are	1.0
Hopefully the odds of winning are	Were never going to get   its never gonna equal up to one though	1.0
Were never going to get   its never gonna equal up to one though	Does it have to	1.0
Does it have to	No but I was thinking you know how we do like uh like A	1.0
No but I was thinking you know how we do like uh like A	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	For four   you know what Im saying	1.0
For four   you know what Im saying	Mhmm	1.0
Mhmm	And it would be like a A B A A you know sort of stuff like that	1.0
And it would be like a A B A A you know sort of stuff like that	What does that have to do	2.0
What does that have to do	Find out the odds of not winning	1.0
Find out the odds of not winning	Thats like six	1.0
Thats like six	To get the probability	1.0
To get the probability	wouldnt you have easier odds of winning in six games than in four	1.0
wouldnt you have easier odds of winning in six games than in four	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Doesnt it get less though	1.0
Doesnt it get less though	Thats why its wrong	4.0
Thats why its wrong	Okay	0.0
Okay	Theres probably a different way to do it  than saying just multiplying	1.0
Theres probably a different way to do it  than saying just multiplying	Its like	0.0
Its like	Mike why dont you move like just move in a little	0.0
Mike why dont you move like just move in a little	Okay thats good enough	0.0
Okay thats good enough	Two inches	0.0
Two inches	Theres gotta be a different way of urn of looking at it then cause if you just say multiply the probability in four games and seven games itd be	4.0
Theres gotta be a different way of urn of looking at it then cause if you just say multiply the probability in four games and seven games itd be	ts gonna be too   its too small	1.0
ts gonna be too   its too small	Its gonna be harder in seven but actually its really not	1.0
Its gonna be harder in seven but actually its really not	Cause youve got more chances	4.0
Cause youve got more chances	Yeah cause you could win one lose one	4.0
Yeah cause you could win one lose one	So	0.0
So	You could win three and lose three	1.0
You could win three and lose three	The sevensided thing or something	1.0
The sevensided thing or something	Or you could think of it like	0.0
Or you could think of it like	Yeah if you list them like	1.0
Yeah if you list them like	That would be like seven different things	1.0
That would be like seven different things	This one is two	1.0
This one is two	Like a a sevensided	1.0
Like a a sevensided	I would say like a win and a loss like that	1.0
I would say like a win and a loss like that	Then you go like this	1.0
Then you go like this	You have with the four games you have a maximum of four and you have to win four so its like you have to be a  hundred percent a winner	4.0
You have with the four games you have a maximum of four and you have to win four so its like you have to be a  hundred percent a winner	And with seven games you have seven possible a you have to do is win in four	4.0
And with seven games you have seven possible a you have to do is win in four	So you got a four out of seven chance of	4.0
So you got a four out of seven chance of	But then so then	0.0
But then so then	But whats the overall probability	2.0

But then whats the probability of winning four games if thats the case	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	You cant say a hundred percent	1.0
You cant say a hundred percent	yeah	1.0
yeah	That one would be like kind of like half	1.0
That one would be like kind of like half	The probability of a team winning   if theres seven games is one hundred percent	1.0
The probability of a team winning   if theres seven games is one hundred percent	The only way to win in four games is if   cause theres going to be a team	1.0
The only way to win in four games is if   cause theres going to be a team	Oh yeah I understand that but say uh Team A	1.0

Didnt we do this one time	We never did a problem like this	1.0
We never did a problem like this	What if we did the probability of not winning	2.0
What if we did the probability of not winning	Remember we did the probability of not winning times like the probability of how many times that you win	1.0
Remember we did the probability of not winning times like the probability of how many times that you win	Thats if you win   if you how many times you like uh five out of six plus five out of six plus five out of six	1.0
Thats if you win   if you how many times you like uh five out of six plus five out of six plus five out of six	Is that it	1.0
Is that it	Um	0.0

I dont know	For this youve gotta find all possibilities with	1.0
For this youve gotta find all possibilities with	Do you want to write down the possibilities so we just see it	0.0
Do you want to write down the possibilities so we just see it	Wait Do you know how many two to the seventh is	2.0
Wait Do you know how many two to the seventh is	Yeah its the order you win though too	1.0
Yeah its the order you win though too	Yeah and we also have to look at the fact that	1.0
Yeah and we also have to look at the fact that	Yeah I know	1.0
Yeah I know	For like five to be   five   five	1.0
For like five to be   five   five	First we look at it like this and then we move over	1.0
First we look at it like this and then we move over	Five Bs is not	1.0
Five Bs is not	Its like three As it could be a  B and then	1.0
Its like three As it could be a  B and then	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Like five Bs or five As and then	1.0
Like five Bs or five As and then	Yeah I know	1.0
Yeah I know	Im just saying like each time wed look over like well five well see how many   you know	1.0
Im just saying like each time wed look over like well five well see how many   you know	To have	0.0
To have	I can do the ones just having A  winning like having	1.0
I can do the ones just having A  winning like having	It would be eight for the five	1.0
It would be eight for the five	Do you understand just like you know having	1.0
Do you understand just like you know having	Yeah but youre not going to know if you have them all though	1.0
Yeah but youre not going to know if you have them all though	How are you gonna know	2.0
How are you gonna know	To have   this will be five games will be eight	1.0
To have   this will be five games will be eight	Think so	1.0
Think so	Cause like itd be these four cause look you can only lose one game right	4.0
Cause like itd be these four cause look you can only lose one game right	Mm Oh so its only	0.0
Mm Oh so its only	You cant lose the last one or cause or they already won four you know what I mean	1.0
You cant lose the last one or cause or they already won four you know what I mean	Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah	1.0
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah	So itd be these and then like A there and then Bs in the other place	1.0
So itd be these and then like A there and then Bs in the other place	You know what I mean	1.0
You know what I mean	All right	0.0
All right	So after the four for winning in  four games	1.0
So after the four for winning in  four games	Should it be over seven though	1.0
Should it be over seven though	Eight of these Itd be over like total possibilities of	1.0
Eight of these Itd be over like total possibilities of	Yeah the total possibilities is eight right	1.0
Yeah the total possibilities is eight right	They have eight ways of winning but itd be over	1.0
They have eight ways of winning but itd be over	Oh Eight over one no well how do we find out	2.0
Oh Eight over one no well how do we find out	Id be over   the total possibilities of two like two   two colors and five things	1.0
Id be over   the total possibilities of two like two   two colors and five things	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	It wouldnt   they wouldnt be over the whole thing like a seven	1.0
It wouldnt   they wouldnt be over the whole thing like a seven	It wouldnt be	1.0
It wouldnt be	It should be over over seven cause its four out of seven games	4.0
It should be over over seven cause its four out of seven games	But this one wouldnt be over seven	1.0
But this one wouldnt be over seven	It wouldnt be	1.0
It wouldnt be	It wouldnt None of this would be over seven	1.0
It wouldnt None of this would be over seven	So why would it be eight	2.0
So why would it be eight	I missed that	0.0
I missed that	See I didnt hear you	0.0
See I didnt hear you	Because hes going like this   youre just moving it over and then	4.0
Because hes going like this   youre just moving it over and then	Eight	1.0
Eight	Yeah well the last one would be B  B B  B A	1.0
Yeah well the last one would be B  B B  B A	mmhmm	1.0
mmhmm	In that case they would have won at this game right here	1.0
In that case they would have won at this game right here	But that would count though	1.0
But that would count though	Wouldnt it only be four	1.0
Wouldnt it only be four	How is that eight though	2.0
How is that eight though	Itd count in the total possibilities but it couldnt count in the wins	1.0
Itd count in the total possibilities but it couldnt count in the wins	I counted that one the B and then the four As but you cant do four Bs and then an A	1.0
I counted that one the B and then the four As but you cant do four Bs and then an A	No itd just be four Bs	1.0
No itd just be four Bs	You know what I mean	1.0
You know what I mean	Then B A A A A	1.0
Then B A A A A	Okay So should we stick with one team winning or either team winning	2.0
Okay So should we stick with one team winning or either team winning	It has to be either	1.0
It has to be either	Well its gotta be whats the probability in the World Series that they would win in five four games	2.0
Well its gotta be whats the probability in the World Series that they would win in five four games	So itd be either	1.0
So itd be either	Now you just gotta find the total possibilities of	1.0
Now you just gotta find the total possibilities of	you know what I mean	1.0
you know what I mean	First of all	0.0
First of all	Wouldnt it be two to the fifth	1.0
Wouldnt it be two to the fifth	Or would it be two to the seventh	1.0
Or would it be two to the seventh	Two to the seventh is a hundred twentyeight	1.0
Two to the seventh is a hundred twentyeight	And but like B B  B  B B like B seven times wouldnt count	1.0
And but like B B  B  B B like B seven times wouldnt count	But on the other hand the sum	1.0
But on the other hand the sum	But Im saying for this one its eight over would it be eight over two to the seventh or two to the fifth	2.0
But Im saying for this one its eight over would it be eight over two to the seventh or two to the fifth	Maybe to the fifth	1.0
Maybe to the fifth	Well because	0.0
Well because	It wouldnt be two to the fifth because some games would have to go more than five games	4.0
It wouldnt be two to the fifth because some games would have to go more than five games	Well well whats the first one	2.0
Well well whats the first one	Then five slots	1.0
Then five slots	This only goes five slots but then what happens when it goes to six games	2.0
This only goes five slots but then what happens when it goes to six games	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Are you doing that for seven	1.0
Are you doing that for seven	For six	1.0
For six	Only   theres a total of two ways they could win in  four games right	1.0
Only   theres a total of two ways they could win in  four games right	Yeah its two over two to the fourth	1.0
Yeah its two over two to the fourth	Why is it two to the fourth	2.0
Why is it two to the fourth	Because thats the total like   two to the fourth will give you the total possibilities of four things	4.0
Because thats the total like   two to the fourth will give you the total possibilities of four things	all right	0.0
all right	You know what I mean	1.0
You know what I mean	It has to be over do you know what Im talking about or not	1.0
It has to be over do you know what Im talking about or not	Yeah its got to be over two to the fourth four spaces	1.0
Yeah its got to be over two to the fourth four spaces	The total possibilities of A B yeah four spaces	1.0
The total possibilities of A B yeah four spaces	Yeah all right	1.0
Yeah all right	It makes sense	1.0
It makes sense	Thats what	0.0
Thats what	And then thatd be eight over two to the fifth you think	1.0
And then thatd be eight over two to the fifth you think	Thats four eight thats sixteen	1.0
Thats four eight thats sixteen	And then eight over two to the fifth	1.0
And then eight over two to the fifth	I guess	1.0
I guess	Which would be	1.0
Which would be	Thirtytwo	1.0
Thirtytwo	What does eight over thirtytwo reduce to	2.0
What does eight over thirtytwo reduce to	Theres more than thirtytwo though	1.0
Theres more than thirtytwo though	Four four over sixteen	1.0
Four four over sixteen	One over eight	1.0
One over eight	Thats one eight right	1.0
Thats one eight right	But is there thirtytwo possibilities in  five games	1.0
But is there thirtytwo possibilities in  five games	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats what ImI think theres more	1.0
Thats what ImI think theres more	For how many games	2.0
For how many games	Five	1.0
Five	Hold on	1.0
Hold on	What do you  you got eight	1.0
What do you  you got eight	How many possibilities	2.0

Yeah it is  thirtytwo	Brian	0.0
Brian	Cause remember you do the blanks like the five blanks	4.0
Cause remember you do the blanks like the five blanks	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Where you just go two	1.0
Where you just go two	Two two   you can put either A or B A or B A or B	1.0
Two two   you can put either A or B A or B A or B	Yeah well then its just two to the fifth	1.0
Yeah well then its just two to the fifth	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And for six itd be	1.0
And for six itd be	And thatd be sixtyfour	1.0
And thatd be sixtyfour	And then the last one would be a hundred over a hundred and twentyeight	1.0
And then the last one would be a hundred over a hundred and twentyeight	Yeah but we gotta find the other things	1.0
Yeah but we gotta find the other things	You know what I mean	1.0

And seven   whats wouldnt this be like one twentyeight over one twentyeight	Excuse me	1.0
Excuse me	Would that be one twentyeight out of one twentyeight	1.0
Would that be one twentyeight out of one twentyeight	One twentyeight out of one twentyeight	1.0
One twentyeight out of one twentyeight	Cause theres theres   a team has to win by seven games	4.0
Cause theres theres   a team has to win by seven games	Like one hundred percent	1.0
Like one hundred percent	I know but its not saying whats the chances whats thewhats the probability that a World Series will be won in seven games not that someone will win in the seventh game	1.0
I know but its not saying whats the chances whats thewhats the probability that a World Series will be won in seven games not that someone will win in the seventh game	No Yeah	1.0
No Yeah	That   the World Series has to be won in the seven games	1.0
That   the World Series has to be won in the seven games	Thats not the question	1.0
Thats not the question	Its whats the chances that it will be won in the seventh not in	1.0
Its whats the chances that it will be won in the seventh not in	The sixth	1.0
The sixth	Probably  well	1.0
Probably  well	Theyre saying if its won in  seven games	1.0
Theyre saying if its won in  seven games	Yeah but for six wouldnt it be something like this	1.0
Yeah but for six wouldnt it be something like this	See I know what youre saying but its I dont think its being asked like that Its like of course	1.0
See I know what youre saying but its I dont think its being asked like that Its like of course	Do you want me to write out possibilities for seven	0.0
Do you want me to write out possibilities for seven	This will take	0.0
This will take	No its saying whats the possibility thats its won	1.0
No its saying whats the possibility thats its won	This is going to take forever	0.0
This is going to take forever	Lets say you just take the seventh game	1.0
Lets say you just take the seventh game	Obviously that would be the hundred percent	1.0
Obviously that would be the hundred percent	Yeah that was	1.0
Yeah that was	Im going to write that	0.0
Im going to write that	Its not saying theres a probability that World Series is won   is won in   you know whats the probability that its in one of you know one of these four	1.0
Its not saying theres a probability that World Series is won   is won in   you know whats the probability that its in one of you know one of these four	All possibilities	1.0
All possibilities	You see well I had thought of	0.0
You see well I had thought of	Are we doing it right then or not	1.0
Are we doing it right then or not	Im going to write that	0.0
Im going to write that	Oh well I thought it was	1.0
Oh well I thought it was	Theyre asking will be won in seven games	1.0
Theyre asking will be won in seven games	And obviously thats a  hundred	1.0
And obviously thats a  hundred	Yeah but I	0.0
Yeah but I	How about this	2.0
How about this	The probabilily has to be a hundred though	1.0
The probabilily has to be a hundred though	I know whats the chance that it  that out of I thcught that all the games	1.0
I know whats the chance that it  that out of I thcught that all the games	It   it will it will	1.0
It   it will it will	No Im not saying it has to add up to a seven has to be a hundred	1.0
No Im not saying it has to add up to a seven has to be a hundred	I dont	0.0
I dont	Theyre theyre not asking like whats the probability that you win the World Series	1.0
Theyre theyre not asking like whats the probability that you win the World Series	Whats the probability that its in that it was won in the seventh game or the sixth game	1.0
Whats the probability that its in that it was won in the seventh game or the sixth game	See I dont think thats what	1.0
See I dont think thats what	No its whats the probability it would of won in	1.0
No its whats the probability it would of won in	Its easy if you really just read it how it is	1.0
Its easy if you really just read it how it is	It cant be a hundred	1.0
It cant be a hundred	Because then it can be won in four games	4.0
Because then it can be won in four games	No no Im saying what	1.0
No no Im saying what	You said if it reaches the seventh game ifs going to be won	1.0
You said if it reaches the seventh game ifs going to be won	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Thats obvious but theyre not asking that	1.0
Thats obvious but theyre not asking that	Can we factor this out	1.0
Yes	Were not uh exactly sure whats being asked here	2.0
Whats the confusion	I mean are you saying that like in seven games are you saying whats the chances that someone will win it all in seven games	3.0
I mean are you saying that like in seven games are you saying whats the chances that someone will win it all in seven games	Like for the the just 0 part	3.0
Like for the the just 0 part	Or are you saying	0.0
Or are you saying	Are you saying if it gets to the seventh game then its an obvious answer	1.0
Are you saying if it gets to the seventh game then its an obvious answer	You won in the seventh game	1.0
You won in the seventh game	Then then its a hundred percent	1.0
No but	But youre asking youre asking it the other way	3.0
But youre asking youre asking it the other way	Youre asking out of all the chances	3.0
Yeah thats what   thats what I figured	Alright so its	0.0
Alright so its	That way it allyou   it all adds up to uh it all adds up to thirtytwo	3.0
That way it allyou   it all adds up to uh it all adds up to thirtytwo	It should add up to a hundred	1.0
It should add up to a hundred	So wait wait	0.0
So wait wait	If eighteen out of sixtyfour is  right then nine thirtytwas eight thirtytwas and two thirtytwas is  nineteen thirtytwos	4.0
If eighteen out of sixtyfour is  right then nine thirtytwas eight thirtytwas and two thirtytwas is  nineteen thirtytwos	Im not going to get that far	1.0
Im not going to get that far	Then that means that that game will have to be won in ten in thirteen	4.0
Then that means that that game will have to be won in ten in thirteen	Thatll be in seven its thirteen thirtytwos	4.0
Thatll be in seven its thirteen thirtytwos	If we did everything else right	4.0
If we did everything else right	You know what Im saying	1.0
You know what Im saying	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	I dont know if thats right but   are you going to write them all out	0.0
I dont know if thats right but   are you going to write them all out	Just not all of them but just like the ones that	1.0

All right wait wait   its the first ones two over thirtytwo and eight out of thirtytwo and	Yeah but we wouldnt you just take half of them too	4.0
Yeah but we wouldnt you just take half of them too	Because one teams going to win because we got combinations in both teams	4.0
Because one teams going to win because we got combinations in both teams	So we could just take that team	4.0

You know like I could be	The only   thats what I was saying like only one team	1.0
The only   thats what I was saying like only one team	And to the    thats the total number but its one team thats going to be winning	4.0

Thats right	Thats right	3.0
Whats  whats your reasoning	I dont think that you can do that because if  you put two yellows thatd be too big but  then if you put two purples thats uh thats  uh thatd be too short and	4.0
I dont think that you can do that because if  you put two yellows thatd be too big but  then if you put two purples thats uh thats  uh thatd be too short and	I dont think there is anything	4.0
Can you show us  your yellow and your purple	Well I was thinking	0.0
Well I was thinking	Cause theres usually  the tall one	4.0
Cause theres usually  the tall one	All right	0.0
All right	You see  usually um they are only one with the  shorter one only one block apart	4.0
You see  usually um they are only one with the  shorter one only one block apart	Like that  and so these but then if you have for the  blues like if you have two yellows it would  be too tall and if you have two purples	4.0
Like that  and so these but then if you have for the  blues like if you have two yellows it would  be too tall and if you have two purples	Thatd be too short and then theres really  nothing in between  cause if you do	4.0
Thatd be too short and then theres really  nothing in between  cause if you do	And then here theres nothing  in between right here so theres no way  that you can do that	4.0
And then here theres nothing  in between right here so theres no way  that you can do that	But if you put three greens to it you could	1.0
But if you put three greens to it you could	Yeah but Erik said Erik wants the half	1.0
Yeah but Erik said Erik wants the half	cause I figured that out too	0.0
cause I figured that out too	I think you could do it but theyre   See I  figure if you take a yellow and a purple its  equal	4.0
I think you could do it but theyre   See I  figure if you take a yellow and a purple its  equal	Theyre  not exactly the same but theyre both  halves	4.0
Theyre  not exactly the same but theyre both  halves	Because the purple would be half of  this even though the yellow is bigger  because if you put the purple on the bottom  and the yellow on top its equal so theyre  both halves but only ones bigger than the  other	4.0
Because the purple would be half of  this even though the yellow is bigger  because if you put the purple on the bottom  and the yellow on top its equal so theyre  both halves but only ones bigger than the  other	So it equals up to the same thing	4.0
So it equals up to the same thing	If this would be one whole  you could take the yellow to be and you  could call it one half	4.0
If this would be one whole  you could take the yellow to be and you  could call it one half	But if you took another  yellow it would be too big	4.0
But if you took another  yellow it would be too big	But if you took a  purple with the yellow and put it on top of  yellow it equaled to the blue	4.0
But if you took a  purple with the yellow and put it on top of  yellow it equaled to the blue	So the purple  would be a half and the yellow would be a  half except that the yellow would just be  one bigger than the other	4.0
So the purple  would be a half and the yellow would be a  half except that the yellow would just be  one bigger than the other	Or maybe you  could call this three quarters and you could call this one  quarter	4.0
Or maybe you  could call this three quarters and you could call this one  quarter	And but it  would still equal up to the whole	4.0
And but it  would still equal up to the whole	I didnt think of that	0.0
I didnt think of that	Like that	0.0
Like that	Cause I was  thinking that um that you would need the  same	3.0
Cause I was  thinking that um that you would need the  same	Yeah but that might	0.0
Yeah but that might	You dont really	1.0
You dont really	air	0.0
air	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Well well I mean	0.0
Well well I mean	Yes cause the pink is the purple is smaller  than the yellow and the person who got the  purple wouldnt have as much	4.0
Yes cause the pink is the purple is smaller  than the yellow and the person who got the  purple wouldnt have as much	Yeah but you could call this three quarters  and this one quarter and it would still be  equal up to the whole	4.0
Yeah but you could call this three quarters  and this one quarter and it would still be  equal up to the whole	Then it just wouldnt  be halves it would be quarters	4.0
Then it just wouldnt  be halves it would be quarters	But it would  still look like youre dividing it into halves  but youre really dividing into quarters	4.0
But it would  still look like youre dividing it into halves  but youre really dividing into quarters	Well you could you could use say if there if  there was three people   you could at least  split it into thirds you could at least split it  into thirds	4.0
Well you could you could use say if there if  there was three people   you could at least  split it into thirds you could at least split it  into thirds	Well no	1.0
Well no	Its not	3.0
Its not	You see were trying to do  it in halves	3.0
You see were trying to do  it in halves	Oh	0.0
Oh	When youre dividing things into halves  both halves have to be equal   in order to be  considered a half	4.0
When youre dividing things into halves  both halves have to be equal   in order to be  considered a half	this isnt a half	1.0
this isnt a half	Those two arent  both even halves	1.0
Those two arent  both even halves	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Well	0.0
Well	Well see	0.0
Well see	This isnt exactly dividing into halves	3.0
This isnt exactly dividing into halves	But Im still using two blocks but  not  Im dividing it in half still using two  blocks but one block is bigger than the  other block	4.0
But Im still using two blocks but  not  Im dividing it in half still using two  blocks but one block is bigger than the  other block	So its like using three quarters  and one quarter but youre only using two  blocks so its almost like dividing it in half	4.0
So its like using three quarters  and one quarter but youre only using two  blocks so its almost like dividing it in half	Well if hes saying hes saying that he wants  a half but if he puts that a purple and a  yellow he wont have a half	4.0
Well if hes saying hes saying that he wants  a half but if he puts that a purple and a  yellow he wont have a half	He would have  three quarters and one quarter	4.0
He would have  three quarters and one quarter	And he  wants a half	4.0
And he  wants a half	Um	0.0
Um	You cant if youre div you cant divide  that into halves because youd have to use  rods that are of different sizes but you  could divide it into thirds using rods that are  the same size which which is the light green  rods	4.0
You cant if youre div you cant divide  that into halves because youd have to use  rods that are of different sizes but you  could divide it into thirds using rods that are  the same size which which is the light green  rods	But I didnt want thirds	1.0
But I didnt want thirds	I  think that some of these that you cant do  like this would be odd	4.0
I  think that some of these that you cant do  like this would be odd	this could be even	4.0
this could be even	This would be odd	4.0
This would be odd	Be  even	4.0
Be  even	This be you  see then when you get up to here blue  would be odd but like with brown you  could take these two	4.0
This be you  see then when you get up to here blue  would be odd but like with brown you  could take these two	and put them  together and that would be even	4.0
and put them  together and that would be even	Take the  orange put the yellows with the orange and  that would be even	4.0
Take the  orange put the yellows with the orange and  that would be even	No	1.0
No	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah yeah	0.0
Yeah yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And  I think one more time as a summary because  youre saying that purple could not be  considered one half because one of the  conditions isnt met right	4.0
And  I think one more time as a summary because  youre saying that purple could not be  considered one half because one of the  conditions isnt met right	I mean theyre  both the same size	4.0
I mean theyre  both the same size	Um hm	0.0
Um hm	But they dont um if you put like  that	4.0
But they dont um if you put like  that	they dont uh theyre not as big as the blue	4.0
Think  about it for a minute and you want to talk to you partner	Youre using all the yellows	0.0
Youre using all the yellows	I have them	0.0
I have them	I only have two	0.0
I only have two	Oh	0.0
Oh	She called orange two	0.0
She called orange two	One half	3.0
One half	Two	3.0
Two	Then this would  have to be one	3.0
Brian what do you think now when we call this we give  this the number name two the orange what number name are  we going to give to yellow	One	3.0
You can come up here  and show us	You would put two yellows together and it would be the same  size as that and even if and thats like having so if this is considered a two	4.0
You would put two yellows together and it would be the same  size as that and even if and thats like having so if this is considered a two	Then those two would  be considered like a regular orange so it would be considered a  one	4.0
Okay so youd consider each of these a one is  that what youre saying	No that like together they would equal the same as that  so it would be a one	4.0
So the number name youre giving yellow then was what	One one	3.0
I  heard I heard some	I have another name	0.0
I have another name	You can call it another name	3.0
Okay what would you call it Erik	Well see do you have to call the orange two	0.0
Well Ive arbitrarily picked that Im calling the orange two	Well you could call it one and if you call it one then two  yellows would be a half	4.0
Well you could call it one and if you call it one then two  yellows would be a half	If that would be considered if the  orange would be considered two then youd call those one	4.0
If that would be considered if the  orange would be considered two then youd call those one	But if you can call it one you could call  those halves	4.0
Thats interesting what if I call the orange  uh	There might be other ways	3.0
There might be other ways	You can split them  you can maybe split it into thirds and call that a one but we  dont have enough thirds	4.0
Kimberly	Five	3.0
Can you come up and tell us about  that	Look here before you said that would equal two and then Brian said that would equal once	1.0
Look here before you said that would equal two and then Brian said that would equal once	So now youre saying that that equals six so I figured that if that equaled one before it would equal five now	4.0
Uh lets see	You said that the orange was six	1.0
You said that the orange was six	And  before you said that this was two and this was one	1.0
And  before you said that this was two and this was one	So now if youre calling six and have of six would  be three	4.0
So now if youre calling six and have of six would  be three	So thats	0.0
Meredith	Yeah	0.0
Jessica	I agree with him because like half of six is three so that would	4.0
Can you help me  understand why you think five	Well before you said that was two the orange was two and the  yellow was one	1.0
Well before you said that was two the orange was two and the  yellow was one	So now youre saying its six so the yellow  could be five	4.0
Youre saying  if this is five and this  is five this is six	Okay I made a mistake I	3.0
What did you mean Kimberly	Well I made the mistake	3.0
Well I made the mistake	I figured it out now	0.0
Thats what I want to know	I made the mistake thinking from before I forgot that adding  one and one is two but five and five isnt six so I made that  mistake	4.0
If you want this to be five what would you have to call the  orange	Ten	3.0
Id like everybody to watch what they do  because if you have a different way of thinking about it Id like  to see that also	Well we thought that if we had to find one half of that we took  two dark greens and the white one	4.0
Well we thought that if we had to find one half of that we took  two dark greens and the white one	And we said if we split the  white one in half then it would be half because if you put the  white one there it would equal up the the train that you made	4.0
And we said if we split the  white one in half then it would be half because if you put the  white one there it would equal up the the train that you made	Quick give me the yellow I need the yellow	0.0
Quick give me the yellow I need the yellow	I  have a solution I have a solution	0.0
Meredith	Well because you want to have seven and six seven but there  are no rods that are really seven and you need it to be thirteen	4.0
Well because you want to have seven and six seven but there  are no rods that are really seven and you need it to be thirteen	So those two blocks and half of that would equal up to it and it  would help	4.0
Okay can you say a little bit more about that	Well take the two greens and take a white	3.0
Well take the two greens and take a white	And you do that	3.0
Ok its just like our picture up here	And theres no blocks that have half on them and for the  uneven numbers for the odd numbers you need a half because  you cant make it without it	4.0
Brian what did you want to add	Well like what we did last time with when Mrs Maher was  talking about about if we split the gold equally what you could  do is well I thought of a lot of ways	4.0
Well like what we did last time with when Mrs Maher was  talking about about if we split the gold equally what you could  do is well I thought of a lot of ways	So like once I have the  white cube in the middle you split that in half right in the  middle	4.0
So like once I have the  white cube in the middle you split that in half right in the  middle	Thats what we did last time	0.0
Ok go ahead	If thats a light green then you  could just make a yellow and add one and a half to the yellow  and one and a half to the other yellow	4.0
Does anyone know what	means	0.0
means	I dont want you to tell me yet	0.0
I dont want you to tell me yet	The light green	3.0
I dont  understand	You split it in the middle and it would be one and half on each  side	4.0
Well if were calling this light green three  what are you calling this train with the light green and the  orange together	Well the yellow is I think the yellows um I think yellow is  about five long and the green in the middle Ten  eleven twelve and then thirteen thirteen yellows	3.0
You were thinking of the whole length of the train as being  thirteen of what	Thirteen	3.0
Thirteen blues thirteen oranges thirteen what	Thirteen yellows	3.0
Thirteen yellows	If you turn the light green into yellows	3.0
I dont understand	Well if you cut that  in the middle and then you  just paint the light green of each piece yellow and youre  making it thirteen and it will be equal to the train	4.0
Why thirteen	Wait shes getting thirteen from the number of the whole train	0.0
Well she keeps saying that the length of this is thirteen	Yeah I know I know where shes getting it	1.0
Yeah I know I know where shes getting it	Well see if you take one of the orange rods and take all these  little things and you put it up to it it will equal ten	4.0
Well see if you take one of the orange rods and take all these  little things and you put it up to it it will equal ten	And then if you do the same thing with the light green rod itll  equal three	4.0
And then if you do the same thing with the light green rod itll  equal three	And if you have ten and three its thirteen	4.0
I understand ok I understand what youre  saying thats wonderful	Yeah thirteen	3.0
Do we have a minute to do another one or do we have to clean  up	I have another solution	0.0
I have another solution	I figured you could take two light greens and  put them there	4.0
I figured you could take two light greens and  put them there	And then after that I just took all these the clear  ones and I figured well I put down seven	4.0
And then after that I just took all these the clear  ones and I figured well I put down seven	And I  figured that they all equal and if you have these two you would  have three and then you could take one and put it on that and so  it would be four five you would have three four	4.0
And I  figured that they all equal and if you have these two you would  have three and then you could take one and put it on that and so  it would be four five you would have three four	and then four five five six six and then seven	4.0
So you figured then that you can put have seven on  each of our halves	Yeah of the halves and then like youre making a new rod	3.0
Hes saying	Yeah well no well I mean not seven and seven seven and six	3.0
Yeah well no well I mean not seven and seven seven and six	Its an odd number of white the clears so it wouldnt be seven  one would be seven and one would be six	4.0
What could I do	What could you do I think what you could do is hmm you  could take this	4.0
What could you do I think what you could do is hmm you  could take this	And you could replace those two those  three with a light green yeah on of the light greens like that	4.0
Uh huh oh but I have one for this guy and one for this guy  one for this guy and what about this guy	Oh what this guy would go	0.0
Would you agree that maybe I could take this one   and saw it in half if I had a saw	Yeah	0.0
And then what could I do with it if I sawed it in half	Then you could put half here and half here	3.0

Somebody take me through the process Ill call on somebody person four all right take me through the process  shhh	What Ill do first is do the zeros you  since you cant do that youll would have to borrow form the two making that a one I just skipped the process of making it a 10 then making it a nine by just making it a nine because the first two zeros is nine then the last zero is 10	4.0

We don t have a two thousandths	Two hundredths is not bigger than five hundredths	4.0
Two hundredths is not bigger than five hundredths	So I round it down	4.0
Before you even did that what did you have to know	I had to know that you needed to just round the hundredths actually	3.0
Don t you have to know where the tenths place is	Yes	0.0
What digit is in the tenths place	One	3.0
You looked at the two in the hundredths right	Yes	0.0
Then what	Then I saw that it was below five	4.0

Okay 2015 Abby	I know that 20 5 is 4 so it is 4	4.0
Hey everybody 35	Seven	3.0
10	Two	3.0
All right then what did you notice about these four	Theyre the same	3.0
Why is it the same Matty	Because when youre doing times 15 youre doing 15 3 to get 3 but over there	4.0
You mean 15 5	Yes and over there it doesnt show a fraction it just shows its divided by five	3.0
Yes any other comments about this Franc	The one and the numerator we dont use that	4.0
The one and the numerator we dont use that	So its the same number divided by five	4.0

Yes so thats your answer here	Oh you should explain	2.0
So this one 20 5 and then you look to your numerator and youve got to remember that you have to multiply what by whatever is there	Okay	0.0
Focus on this one	Okay	0.0
Okay	There has to be a whole number	3.0
There has to be a whole number	It doesnt have to be a whole number	1.0
It doesnt have to be a whole number	I think	0.0
I think	Then how do you know	2.0
Then how do you know	If theres four eight twelve so how are they forming a third	2.0
If theres four eight twelve so how are they forming a third	Form one third is because four eight twelve thats a third right	4.0
Form one third is because four eight twelve thats a third right	Oh like one	0.0
Then you have to multiply by the numerator because whats 103	I want you to explain this	2.0
Well you know you do this and its 20 5 times This is just going to be the same answers	I dont understand	2.0
I dont understand	This is pretty long and this is wrong	0.0

Kyan read the problem	Can I explain why	0.0
Can I explain why	Oh yes	0.0
You need to figure out why you didnt get 102	I did get 102	0.0
Grant	So first you wrote the numbers	4.0
So first you wrote the numbers	So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	4.0
So X is the is and 120 is the of and then 15100 is that one	You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	4.0
You do 100 times X which is 100X and then you do a and you do a hundred times X which is a hundred X and then you do 100 times 15 which is 1800	Then you do 1800 divided by 100 which is 18 and then you do that minus or you do 120 minus 18 you get 102	4.0
So if Im thinking about this problem I know that 15 were late and its asking how many were on time 15 were late what percent were on time	His sneeze turned it off	0.0
If 15 were late what percent were on time	Eightyfive	3.0
Kyan where did you get 85	Because 100 minus 15	3.0

Andrew what did you do	we did former X is equal to 16 over 100 then we did 16  X which is 16X and then 4 x 100 which is 400	4.0
we did former X is equal to 16 over 100 then we did 16  X which is 16X and then 4 x 100 which is 400	Then we divide both of them with 15 and got 25 then after that	4.0
What does 25 represent Andrew	It represents how many cars there are	3.0
Then what would you have to do	Youd have to subtract four and then get 21	3.0
Is it the part or the whole	I think its the part because like the whole is like how much you compare it for	4.0

What	That one	0.0
This one	110	3.0
Now if we look at our place value chart remember that we added a couple of new place values a couple of weeks ago	Yes	0.0
So if I say 110 where am I going put my one	In the 10	3.0
All right put an answer down in five four three two one showdown	Ms Ms Cornish I have a question	0.0
Whats the question	Does that count	3.0
Say one more time	Ill do that	0.0
Okay did you guys hear what he said	Yes	0.0
If this is 110 and its 0 and 110 then 310 is going to look pretty similar because the three is in the	One	3.0
All right are you guys ready for another challenge	Yes	0.0
Yes	No Im not ready	0.0
Read it	2100	3.0
Apollo read it for me	2100	3.0
Apollo where am I going to put my two	Youre going to put your two on the back and then you add the zero first and then point zero then two	4.0
You said put the zero in what place value	In the hundredths	3.0
Jane read this fraction for me	9100	3.0
In what place value	Tenths	3.0
Read it to me one more time	9100	3.0
So which place value is it going to go in tenths or hundredths	Hundredths	3.0
Hundredths yes so my nine goes here and then Jane what else goes in my blank	Zero	3.0
A period but in math it is a	Decimal	3.0
A good connection	Or and and	0.0

that the same thing as 80100	No	0.0
Winston	In the hundredths	3.0
Thats it its in the hundredths now	In the tenths	3.0
He said lets put the eight in the 10th place and then Winston what am I going to put in the hundredths	The one	3.0
The one where in the one	The eight	3.0

You guys have 2 14	Yes	0.0
So this	Yes	0.0
Okay if I say that last night I ate 2 14 of pizza how many do you think I ate	Two	3.0
I ate two whole pizzas and then how much of a third one	14	3.0
I dont see a picture on your paper	2 14	3.0
If I come in and I say Oh my gosh it hurts so bad how much pizza did I eat Dakota	24	3.0
Ivana how many whole pizzas did I eat	Two	3.0
How much of this one	One	3.0
Do you guys agree with me that this shows 2 14	Yes	0.0
Do they have pieces in them yet	No	0.0
How do I know how many pieces are in this pizza	I dont know	0.0
Ivana how do I know that there are four pieces in these two pizzas	Because theres already 14 and that means four	4.0
Does my denominator tell me how many pieces there are in all	Yes	0.0
This whole pizza what fraction of the pizza that I eat Harriette	14	3.0
No 14 would be one of these pizzas but I ate all of them	One whole	3.0
One whole or Ernie	44	3.0
44 because out of four pieces I ate how many Darby	Four	3.0
Ivana	44	3.0
JJ	14	3.0
Dana help me out one of these pieces how much am I eating	14	3.0
All right what about this one if I ate both of those	24	3.0
What about this one	34	3.0
34	14	1.0
14	54	1.0
54	64 74 84	3.0
And	94	3.0
94	Whoa you ate a lot of pizza miss	0.0
Are you guys ready to learn their special names	Yes	0.0
All right so on your paper what I need you to have written is I need to have all of this written on your paper	I dont have space for this Im going to have to write to a different source	0.0
Im just going to keep how many pieces I ate and then over here Im going to show that is out of how many	I dont know how to write that weird one	2.0
Thanks Wallace and Wade Darby	Me	0.0
Im going to give you about 10 more seconds to finish up	Do you put equal on both	3.0
I want you to say that mixed number	Mixed number	0.0
If its written on my board its written on your paper	I knew he wouldnt write it thats why I told him he couldnt do it	0.0
So then if I look at 94 is 94 a mixed number	No	0.0
Helen	Because it doesnt have a whole number	4.0
What does it only have	A fraction	3.0
Dakotaa	The bottom	3.0
The bottom	The bottom	1.0
The bottom is bigger than the top in this number	No the top	3.0

fraction	fraction	0.0
An improper fraction is when the top number is what bigger or smaller	Bigger	3.0
Bigger	Smaller	1.0
Winston whats bigger nine or four	Nine	3.0
Nine so is the top number bigger or smaller	Bigger	3.0
Melody	Because the top number it goes more bigger than the pieces that its actually supposed to be	4.0
Okay so if I have six fifths how many pieces is my pizza cut into	Five	3.0
Five	Six	1.0
In six fifths how many pieces is my pizza cut into	Five	3.0
Five pieces and how many pieces do I eat	Six	3.0
Six so do I eat I whole pizza	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
How many pieces did I eat of these	Five	3.0
All of them	Six	3.0
Then how many more	One	3.0
Okay so improper fraction always greater than what	One whole	3.0
All right everybody have this written down	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
Oops	Thats weird	0.0
Today were going to focusing on what	Adding mixed numbers	3.0

The cafeteria has 2 35 tubs of grape jelly and 1 15 tubs of strawberry jelly set aside for breakfast how many tubs of jelly were there in all	Okay so how would I figure this out	0.0
Dakota why did you say were going to add all the numbers up	Because I read it in how much tubs of jelly were there in all	4.0
Because I read it in how much tubs of jelly were there in all	In all means were going to add	4.0
So the cafeteria had how many tubs of grape jelly	2 35	3.0
2 35	One jelly	3.0
One jelly	One jelly	3.0
We had 2 35 tubs of what kind of jelly	Grape	3.0
If you dont have this written down yet write it down on your paper	On any piece of paper	0.0
How much of a third tub of jelly	Five	3.0
I have one whole tub of jelly because thats my whole number and then how much of another one	One fifth	3.0
How many whole tubs of jelly do I have in my picture	Three	3.0
Count them with me	15 25 35 45	0.0
What are my whole numbers in these two Dakotaa	The whole numbers are four and six	3.0
No whole numbers	Three	3.0
What are my whole numbers Anderson	Two and one	3.0
Now do you guys know what two plus one is	Yes	0.0
What is two plus one	Three	3.0
If Im taking out my fractions and adding them up what am I going to add up	Numerators	3.0
Just the numerators so in 3515 Winston do my denominators change	No	0.0
No and what is 31	Four	3.0
Four	Three	1.0
Three	I mean four	3.0
Great	You didnt know what you were doing	0.0
Follow along with your finger point the name of the person who this is about	Where are we at	0.0
What are we going to add	2 14 and 1 24	3.0
Abni will you walk me through what you did	First I did  the whole numbers	3.0
Okay so you took out the whole numbers two and one and you said 21	Then I did equals three and then I did 31	4.0
Why three plus one	Because I took the product and added it with the one came up to one four and then I got four	4.0
Wait hold on can I add my whole numbers to my fractions	No	0.0
Thats like saying that Im going to add two cats to two dogs	That wont end right	3.0
Now those are done what do I have left to add Abni	One plus two which is the two fractions	3.0
So 14 plus what	14 then you add 123	3.0
14 then you add 123	I want to scratch it off with my pencil	0.0
The side noises need to stop	3 34 because those are the two products	4.0
How many wholes do I have Dakotaa	Two	3.0
One two and then Dakotaa how much of another one do I have	14	3.0
What about in 1 24 how many wholes do I have Dana	One	3.0
One and how many of another one do I have Dana	Two	3.0
Two what	Two on the other end	3.0
Out of how many	Four	3.0
Yes so that fraction is	24	3.0
How many wholes do I have	One two three	0.0
One two three	14 24 34	0.0

Vance	Six plus	3.0
No what is the question asking us to find out	The numbers	3.0
Number of what		3.0
What are we trying to figure out in this problem Wade	How many miles they ran	3.0
Vance what are we trying to figure out in this problem	How many miles they ran	3.0
Travis	You would divide	3.0
Divide what	1926 by 6	3.0
Hunter can you walk me through it	Yes	0.0
Oh my gosh	First we need to figure out all the problems weve introduced	4.0
First we need to figure out all the problems weve introduced	Like 6 x 1  6 6 x 2  12 6 x 5  30	4.0
All right Hunter keep going	6 x 10  60 6 x 100  600	4.0
Why did you skip all of those and go straight to 600	Because we dont need the small problems	3.0
Why dont we need the super small problems	Because it will take forever to complete the problem	4.0
Because what are we trying to fit into		3.0
Keep going Hunter	Then 6 x 200  1200 and then 6 x 300  1800 and thats our question	4.0
Thats all you did	Yes	0.0
All right now what	Now the highest we can do is 1900  1000	3.0
Do I need to set up my problem first	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Okay now what	Then we take 300 and put it on the side of	3.0
What is that 300 again	How much it takes to get to 1800	3.0
How many what	Sixes	3.0
Hunter		3.0
Now if you take that away Im sorry this is Hunters problem not mine	Now we need to take it away 0  6 is 6 2  0 is 2 9  8 is 1 and 1  1 is 0	4.0
Now we need to take it away 0  6 is 6 2  0 is 2 9  8 is 1 and 1  1 is 0	Now we can do 6 x 10  60 so we put the 10 on the side then we put 60 below	4.0
Now we can do 6 x 10  60 so we put the 10 on the side then we put 60 below		4.0
	Then subtraction then 6  0 is 6	4.0
Then subtraction then 6  0 is 6	We cant do 2  6 so we tip so we go to 4	4.0
We cant do 2  6 so we tip so we go to 4	1 is now 0 2 is now 12 and 12  6 is 6 and then 0  0 is 0	4.0
1 is now 0 2 is now 12 and 12  6 is 6 and then 0  0 is 0	So now we can do another 10 so we put to that on the side then we put 60 and then 6  0 is 6 and 6  6 is 0	4.0
So now we can do another 10 so we put to that on the side then we put 60 and then 6  0 is 6 and 6  6 is 0	Now we can do 6 x 1 so we put the one on the side and then we put 6 under 6 and then 6  6 is 0	4.0
Now we can do 6 x 1 so we put the one on the side and then we put 6 under 6 and then 6  6 is 0	Now we need to add all these	4.0
Now we need to add all these	300  10  10  1 is 321	4.0

No	Possible	0.0
Can I get 6 into 19	Yes	0.0
How many times	Three	3.0
Albany how many times can I fit 6 into 19	Three	3.0
Now second	You multiply 6 x 3 is 18 so I will subtract it	4.0
Yes and then third subtract	Then you will get one	3.0
Okay now	Check	3.0
Can I fit six into one	No	0.0
Whats fourth	You bring down	3.0
Again	Divide then youll dive 6   6	3.0
What do I have now	6   12	3.0
All right Albany what am dividing	6   12 I will get 2	4.0
First divide second	Multiply 6   30	3.0
No	No multiply	3.0

Wait a minute what does that mean onehalf dozen	Half dozens	0.0
Courtney what does that mean	A dozen means 12 and half a dozen is six because 6  6 is 12	4.0
Courtney has that background knowledge that a dozen equals how many Courtney		3.0
So what would a half dozen be	Six	3.0
If I didnt know what a one half dozen was could I figure out just by looking at the picture	Yes	0.0

Then can you guys make it better	Can we say that we kind of agree	0.0
Can we say that we kind of agree	but I think we can make it better	0.0
Okay how would we make it better	Try and look at the question again and see what answers we get	3.0
What is the question asking you to figure out	If a farmer put 47 apples in trays  each tray had six carrots on the	0.0
Partially	Partially filled tray	0.0
Valerie do you know	I need a credit card	0.0
Just the question	Yes I do not agree	1.0
Can you tell me what youre doing	Were all drawing 37 circles	3.0
All right why	Because I asked them if they wanted to do partial quotientsor pictures	4.0
Okay so you think some of you guys can be doing pictures and some of you guys can be doing partial quotients	Yes I wanted to	0.0
Yes I wanted to	It might have took Ian longer to put the dots but it would have been easier to say you dont have to waste up a whole	3.0
Are you guys writing this together	Yes	0.0
What question should we answer	How many carrots are on the partially filled tray	3.0
What is that mean partially filled	The remainder	3.0
First of all do we agree with this persons answer	Wait because I wanted to ask Ian	0.0
Okay Auden whats your first step when youre solving a problem like that	I bBillieeve our answer	1.0
For a problem like that whats your first step	The answer is five	3.0
The answer is five	I agree with that	1.0
I agree with that	The answer is five	3.0
What is the question	How much	3.0
How much	With the remainder of five or the answer is five	3.0
All right lets start that way	The answer is five	3.0
How many are in each	Five sixes	3.0
If we had six here six here six here and six here how many do we have so far	30 because 6 times 7 equals 35	4.0
30 because 6 times 7 equals 35	No 5 times 7 equals 35	1.0
Yes	6 times 7 equals 42	4.0
Are we 47 quite yet	No were not	3.0
Do you think we can fit another carrot on each tray	6 times six equals	3.0
If we have 42 on the trays so far how many do we have left out of 47	Is six times six equals 26	4.0
What happens to those five	Wait does it ask for the remainder	0.0
Wait does it ask for the remainder	I know	0.0
Does it say that they get thrown in the trash	The farmer	3.0
Do they get on trays	There are five carrots on the partiallyfilled	3.0
There are five carrots on the partiallyfilled	Six times seven	3.0
Martin	47 divide by 6	3.0
How do we know its asking us 47 divided by 6	Because it says the farmers have 47 apples into trays	4.0
Has anyone caught my mistake	Yes	0.0
Whats my mistake Tiffany	Instead of apples at the end you put carrots	0.0
Yes there we go	It transformed with magic	0.0
Mathias	Partial quotients	3.0
I can say 6 x 1	6 x 7  4	4.0
6 x 3		3.0
Mathias	6 x 7	3.0
What is 67 Mathias		3.0
Can I fit six into five	No	0.0
No so what does that tell me five is	Remainder	3.0
Vanessa	Long division	3.0
Mohammad how did you start solving this problem	By using lots of circle and then by pictures	3.0
Now we know our answer we know that I can fill how many full trays	Seven	3.0
Seven	Seven	1.0
Seven and then how many carrots are left without a home	Five	3.0
What answer am I looking for Whittny	The remainder	3.0
How do you know that	Because it says how many carrots are on the partially filled tray	4.0
How many carrots are on the partially filled tray	Whats partially	2.0
If we dont know what partially means then are we able to solve this problem	No	0.0
Baker why dont you give it a shot what	Parts of something	3.0
It is partially filled if Im saying that Bergen brought in this container of maple sausage pancakes partially filled does that mean its full	No	0.0
Im sorry what part of my answer	Remainder	3.0
My remainder because this right here seven remainder five means that I have filled how many full trays	Seven	3.0
Bergen	Five	3.0
First of all do we agree with their answer	No	0.0
They said To solve this problem I divided 47 divided by six therefore I know 47 divided by six equals seven and 56 because of the question	No	0.0
Is the answer 7 and 56	No	0.0
Sorry rewrite this answer	I said to solve this problem 47 divided by six I got seven remainder five so that means the answer is five	4.0
I said to solve this problem 47 divided by six I got seven remainder five so that means the answer is five	Therefore I know the farmer put five carrots on the partially filled tray	4.0
To solve this problem 47 divided by six	I got seven remainder five	3.0
Martin do you have a question	Yes	0.0
Yes whats your question	Why is that there	2.0
Why is what there	The little circle up there	2.0
Are you just trying to be funny	No	0.0
Because when you laugh when youre saying it that could tell me that youre trying to be funny and is now a good time to be funny in math class	No	0.0
What makes this answer better than the one that I had written up there Baker	Because it has more detail	4.0
Why else Myles	It has more dots	4.0
I really wish that we could pay attention and listen Mathias	It makes more sense	4.0
Whittny	They have the right answer	4.0
Tiffany	It has more details and its the remainder of how much the farmer put	4.0
It has more details and its the remainder of how much the farmer put	What	0.0

All right now were going to completely switch gears a little bit and were going to get moving	Yay	0.0
Blake are you done writing this	Yes	0.0
You guys know what an angle is right	Yes	0.0
What are some things that we know about angles Martin	They are something that you use to measure	3.0
Okay we can measure them what else Tiffany	There are a few angles obtuse right angles straight angles	3.0
Whittny what else	Its a measurement	3.0
Its a measurement we can measure them Auden	Its a type of angle like a clock like that	3.0
Its a type of angle like a clock like that	Its like and angle is like that	3.0
They can be like this they can be like that right	Obtuse	3.0

Whittny	Vertex	3.0
Who is the vertex right now	You	3.0
Why am I the vertex of this angle Patrick	Because youre like the point in between the other two points	4.0
Right now Mathias Auden what kind of angle have we produced	Acute angle	3.0
Auden why is this an acute angle	Because its shaping like a mouth	4.0
Its a mouth but its what kind of mouth the bigger or a small mouth	A big mouth	3.0
Big mouth	No a small mouth	3.0
They are less than Phillip	90 degrees	3.0
They are less than 90 degrees so everyone give me an L This is 90 degrees if it is smaller than this it is	An acute	3.0
If it is bigger it is	An Obtuse	3.0
One two three Bergen come here	Me	0.0
If yours looks like this what is it	A right angle	3.0
All right big angles are bigger than what	90 degrees	3.0
What is 90 degrees	A right angle	3.0
What kind of angle	Right	3.0
Everyone look at your angle does it look like a right angle	Yes	0.0
All right I want you to make a straight angle	Straight angle	0.0
One more I want you to make an angle smaller than 90 degrees	Acute angle	3.0
James do you remember one of them	Finding the median	3.0
What do you think Tim	The mode	3.0
Whats the mode	The highest value	3.0
What is it	Mean	3.0
Julian how many people are in Pablos house	Six people	3.0
How do you know	Because I counted three and then theres three on the top so thats six	4.0
Leo how many people are in Yarnells house	Three	3.0
And how many people Kate are in Ruths house	Four	3.0
And Eli how many people are in Garys house	Three	3.0
And Mila how many people are in Brendas house	Six	3.0
Claire what do you think	I have a question	2.0
Sure go for it	Because its two houses of six people and two of three and then two two are those typical values	3.0
What are your modes	Six and three	3.0
Youre thinking three or six	No	0.0
Julian what are you thinking	Im thinking that its four	3.0
How come	Because six times four is 24 and theres two sixes and it seems like its either three or six	4.0
Because six times four is 24 and theres two sixes and it seems like its either three or six	Then I put it in the middle and I get four	4.0
Okay so you were looking at the mode but then you wanted a number that was in the middle of the mode	Yes either four or four and a half	3.0
Dylan would you like to share	Yes sure	0.0
Yes sure	I drew the numbers out like two two three four four two sixes	3.0
Where did you get these numbers from	I got from all the houses where four was and then I saw that six divided in half is three so if you put three on each side that would be three and a half	4.0
Go Eli	I said four because I took the mean so I added up every single person and then I divided by the number of houses so I got four person per house if there was an equal number of people in every house	4.0
Charlotte who could we move first	We move two people from Pablo and then two of Ollies house	4.0
Leah go for it	Can we move one Pablo to Yarnells house	3.0
Can we move people from Brendas house somewhere	We can move someone from Brendas house somewhere to Yarnells house	3.0
Nathan what do you think	If she didnt say I was going to say from Brendas one and Garys one here	2.0
How many	Two	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
What did we figure out might be a nice household size	Four	3.0

Youll have so much fun	Look at all of these rollers	0.0
You can just all tell me	Six	3.0
Sound good so far	Yes	0.0
Earlier you guys told me that the mode You guys remember what you told me what the mode was	31 2	3.0
That was the median	Oh the mode	0.0
Oh the mode	Three and six	3.0
Yes Kaitlyn	I just realized that because were splitting the pieces into average so theyre equal isnt that just like division	4.0
Can you think of an equation that matches the situation that we just did	Maybe something like a 6	3.0
Not give her that answer but coach her	Yes	0.0
Yes	Think of how youre going to get all of the stuff together so that you can split it apart equally	4.0
Think of how youre going to get all of the stuff together so that you can split it apart equally	What would you have to do before you divide it	2.0
What would you have to do before you divide it	Add all the data	3.0
Add all the data	Yes	0.0
The total number of people on pirate street	24	3.0
Eli do you agree	Yes	1.0
What are you going to divide it by	Six	3.0
How come	6 24 is 4	4.0
Yes James	I thought if you If you took people and divide it by the number of houses I thought that would be finding average	4.0
Yes Charlotte	Would the  all data divided by numbers	3.0
Tim	What graphs can you get in them	2.0
What do you think might be a common mis Violet did I forget to call on you	Yes	0.0
Tell me your question first	When youre dividing to get the mean do you always divide the little number of data by	3.0
By the number of groups	Yes	0.0
What do you think	Its like when you move the houses maybe the misconception is that thats the number of people that were moved	3.0
What do you think Claire	They might think of purpose	3.0
They might think of purpose	By giving her line plots in general	3.0
If theyre trying to find the mean using a line plot	Oh they might think that the mean is done like the numbers	3.0
What do you think Tim	That they would try to find the median instead of the mean	3.0
Yes sweetie	I have a question	2.0
Sure	What do you do when theres a remainder	2.0
You can just tell me	Elm street	0.0
Are we doing that because its spooky season	Yes	0.0
Okay	Elm street	0.0
Part three is Elm Street	Part B	0.0
Did I say something else	You said part C	0.0
Yes Tim	Im just curious how you did the line plot	2.0
The line plot	Yes	0.0
Yes Dylan	Can I follow this	0.0
Do you want to tell us what we should move	Yes	0.0
What should we move	On Reggies house you take one and put it on Hectors house	3.0
Can this one be Hector right here	Yes	0.0
Okay	Then you take another one from Reggies and put it in Brendans house	3.0
Id like to hear from an A Dan why cant we just move that X	Because the Xs are houses and the rule is one house	4.0
Because the Xs are houses and the rule is one house	We cant really move the houses	4.0
Eli	If you move the X from four to six it would be like Felixs house getting two more new people and then everything would be there	4.0
You can all tell me	Four	3.0
Whats the median	Four	3.0
Whats the mode	Four	3.0
Four	Yes	0.0
Yes Claire	When were finding the median would you not be able to use the line plot because we havent filled up all of it yet	4.0
You could do a least to greatest it doesnt have to be	Well be using these notes	0.0
Just tell me what you think	Lafayette Street	0.0
Violet how many people got asked that question	Seven people because if you count the dot on the line bar its going to be seven people that the dots represent	4.0
Kaitlyn do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	1.0
Kate do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	1.0
How did you get that	I got that from	0.0
How many people were sampled Ian	18	3.0
How did you get 18	I counted for	3.0
With the squares	Yes squares	0.0
Evan do you agree disagree or have a question	I disagree	1.0
I disagree	I think the number is 10	3.0
How did you get that	I count the people with number two ones its not how many people they were in total its how many people were in the survey and if theres 10 people there it means we have	4.0
You can just tell me one two	20	3.0
You can answer that for me	Page 36	0.0
You can do it next time	Next time	0.0
Agree disagree or have a question with something on the board	I disagree	1.0
Sophia agree disagree or have a question	I agree	1.0
With which part	Wth the range Wait agree with what	2.0
Wth the range Wait agree with what	Like agree with any of them	1.0
Yes	I disagree with the median because its a bar graph	4.0
I disagree with the median because its a bar graph	When you have a bar graph you cant find the	4.0
agree disagree or have a question	I agree with the number of people	1.0
Howd you get 10	I added yellow which is three and red which is two and green which is five	3.0
Right now you said yellow which is three red which is two and green which was how many	Five	3.0
You can agree disagree or have a question	I kind of understand why you would have gaps on the bar graph but I also dont	2.0
I kind of understand why you would have gaps on the bar graph but I also dont	Why wouldnt you make it three bars instead of one	2.0
Jordan do you agree with the height of each of those bars	Yes	1.0
Emily agree disagree or have a question	I agree with the mean because you can get an equal share or an even number if you do any number unless you wanted to get into like fractions but we dont have that yet	4.0
Landon what are you thinking	I disagree because if you use the mean line strategy you would take one off of green and put it on top of red so that everything would be equal except green would be one taller	4.0
I disagree because if you use the mean line strategy you would take one off of green and put it on top of red so that everything would be equal except green would be one taller	But then you could split that one of green into thirds and then put 13 on yellow and 13 on red and leave that last 13 on green	4.0
But then you could split that one of green into thirds and then put 13 on yellow and 13 on red and leave that last 13 on green	Three points three repeated could be the answer	4.0
Max what do you think about that	But you cant split a kid into thirds	3.0
But you cant split a kid into thirds	What if the kid has split decision	2.0
Yes Abby	I got	0.0
Okay so this is what I heard Yes	It cant be 33	3.0
It cant be 33	Repeated	1.0
Repeated	Thats what I said	1.0
Is that what youre saying	Yes	0.0
What now	There is no accurate data	3.0
You guys does that if I go back does that make sense why we cant just move values	Yes	0.0
Max whats the first thing	You need to put your homework in a safe place	0.0
Emily whats the second thing	You need to open your Chromebook	0.0
Luke whats your third thing	You have to go to the website	0.0
Riley whats your fourth thing	You need to put it in a 45 degree angle	0.0
Is somebody playing music	No its a phone	0.0
All right	That would be really nice	0.0
Maya what do you think	So that we can check our answers maybe	0.0
Yes	Do you have to do it with a partner	0.0
It looks to me like youre making sure to write them out in a specific order	Yes	0.0
Yes good job	Landon can we check one with you because were disagreeing on it	1.0
Landon can we check one with you because were disagreeing on it	Wait why cant we go past	0.0
If you wanted to you can just fill like a dot dot dot	Okay	0.0
All right when we look at this here what should your maximum value be	Wait which one is it	2.0
Four and whats the maximum value showing you	Six	3.0
And youre looking for one that has Why do you think that its that one	Because	0.0
Remember that you cant move them there because thats kind of what Landon was talking about earlier	Wait can you move	0.0
and Riley nice job on slide three explaining your work	Wait is this supposed to have the same response as	0.0
It should be Your explanations might be different	Okay but we should have the same answer	1.0
Whats up	We dont understand how youre supposed to find the median	2.0
to find the median	And the mean	2.0
Sound good so far	Yes	0.0
Evan what do you think	I think theres seven people	3.0
I just didnt hear you	Seven houses	3.0
Luke do you agree with that disagree with that or have a question about it	I disagree	1.0
What do you think	I think its 21 because theres three on every corner of the seven houses	4.0
What do you think are the total number of people	21	3.0
Now Evan how many houses do we have	Seven	3.0
What is 21 divided by 7 crew	Three	3.0
Which in this case would be 21 divided by 7 which equals three because seven times three	I didnt finish that	0.0
How would you finished that	Its 21	3.0
Is it recording	Yes	0.0
Can you all see Christmas colors on yours	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	I think I do	0.0
I think I do	Christmas colors	0.0
You guys want to guess what time I was up until	1130 PM	0.0
Anna could you read to us please	Its not following me	0.0
Go for it Anna	The answer is 15	3.0
Can you talk a little bit louder so that the people know the other side of	The answer is 15 which is the cat and the dog was incorrect because he was	3.0
Ben can you tell us when you say they counted wrong what do you think they counted wrong	Maybe the odd or evens	3.0
What do you mean by The odd or evens	Maybe	0.0
Molly you are actually next do you want to read yours sweetie	Yes	0.0
Yes	I think that the dog made the mistake	4.0
I think that the dog made the mistake	I think that when the data points are even I think she might have thought that you circled 2 but when theres even usually the median is right between two numbers and its right between 1 and 2 which is 15	4.0
Youre going to have 0 0 0 0 how many 1s	Six	3.0
How many 2s	Three	3.0
In total Charlotte how many pieces of data do we have	20	3.0
How many would be smaller than the median and how many would be larger	10	3.0
Just so you dont die lets hear your response	What I wrote was that the cat is right with 15 and I think what the dog did was he counted up to 10 and he didnt count the other side like Oh theres ten on this side theres ten on the other side	4.0
Carson lets hear yours	That is correct and you would have to count to 20 and then he would count that theres how many data points and then he would have to count 10 data points in	4.0
Okay start over Carson	That is correct and you would have to count to 20 and then he would count that theres how many data points and then he would have to count 10 data points in	4.0
Isnt that kitty so cute	Shes so cute	0.0
Shes so cute	Actually it pretty much looks like that	0.0
All right you ready	This is for Dog	4.0
This is for Dog	The data is even so you can split it in half so it cant be a solid number and worse its in between like 50 and 50	4.0
You are saying that we have an even number of data points and we dont have to split them in half	Yes when you split it in half it cant win the honor	4.0
Yes when you split it in half it cant win the honor	Its like an exact number unless its in between 50 like the same number data	4.0
Abby might teach us a little French here	I think Cat was right	3.0
I think Cat was right	Dog did not see the data right	3.0
Are you going to use your French words for us	No	0.0
Can you tell us what mistake Dog made	It could have been a lot of things	3.0
It could have been a lot of things	I think  pick the right number between 70 and 75	3.0
I think  pick the right number between 70 and 75	He stopped at 70	3.0
What would you like to add Colin	I think the Dog may have calculated it right but didnt know how to calculate the median	3.0
I think the Dog may have calculated it right but didnt know how to calculate the median	Hes like Hey the median is 70 because its  I think Dog thought Hey the median was 70 but its in between 70 and 75	3.0
We have how many pieces of data	14	3.0
Crew are you ready to get started today	Yes	0.0
All right	I do wish	0.0
Look at the agenda	We were on Netflix	0.0
Crew erase your desk cap your markers put your eyes up here when youre ready to listen	Okay lets do it	0.0
Our plan for today You guys already know how to find your median correct	Thats right	0.0
We need a hand signal for mean what should it be	Like this or like	3.0
That looks like its in the middle	Like this	3.0
When you look at this dude he is part golfing	What	0.0
Yes	Oh yes	0.0
As you are watching this video I want you to think about What is the typical number of swings that this golfer needs	Whats his name again	0.0
What should we call him	Ronald	0.0
Ronald	Jack	0.0
Jack	Arnold Palmer	0.0
Arnold Palmer	Wyatt	0.0
Arnold Palmer	Mr Bobby	0.0
Just need to keep it together	Arnold Palmer	0.0
Arnold Palmer	The ball looks like a little ball	0.0
Do you guys remember at the beginning when we were talking about average and theres three types of average	Yes	0.0
GoWyatt what did you say whats the mode	2	3.0
How do you know	Because theres three 2s	4.0
Theres three 2s and no other value happens three times right	Yes	0.0
Maya what do you think that the median is	I think that it is 4 because there is nine total numbers of data and we need to have four numbers on each side you have to put a box here circle on	4.0
Yes Maggie do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	1.0
Okay did you have any kind of different strategy	No I used that	1.0
What your mean would be	Could we use our notebook to like	0.0
You could write it on your desk if you want to	Should I show my work	0.0
Okay find your means	Which one	0.0
Which one	A or B	0.0
Yes	Which one A or B or all of them	0.0
thinking right now	I figured it out I think its five	3.0
Why do you think its five	Because of the histogram	4.0
The value on the bar graph	Yes and that is what I got	0.0
Yes and that is what I got	The answer I got was mean	3.0
Did anybody solve this using an algorithm	I did	0.0
I did	Oh Lily did	1.0
Lily what did that look like	What do you mean	2.0
Tell me what you did to figure it out	I noticed after I did it that it just says it up there but its okay	0.0
I noticed after I did it that it just says it up there but its okay	I did	3.0
Okay you had two three times	Yes and then 310	4.0
Yes and then 310	What I did is for the ones in parenthesis I made a little  9x2 Okay 2x3 is 6	4.0
I have to write mine up here because I might	Okay 3 is 8 9x2 is 18 10	4.0
Okay 3 is 8 9x2 is 18 10	Then I did 639 and I did 181028	4.0
What did you get when you added all those together	I did it one more time	3.0
Okay	I did 9 Can I do that or should I add	2.0
No you can tell me now thats fine	I did 981728	4.0
I did 981728	Then 172845	4.0
What did you do to find your mean	Theres nine data points so I divided 45 by 9 and I got 5	4.0
Your median remind me	Four	3.0
Thank you and your mean was	Five	3.0
Which of those values over here the mode the median or the mean best represents what kind of golfer Arnold is	I think the mean	3.0
How come	That is technically the average obviously	3.0
Is there one number there that you think doesnt represent him as a golfer	The mode	3.0
Tell us why	He pretty much does it in the first start it wasnt as much of an average	4.0
Which one better represents Arnold as a golfer	From mode and median	0.0
From mode and median	I think	0.0
Sorry out of the median and the mean	Oh the median and the mean	0.0
Oh the median and the mean	I think the median because the number is lower	4.0
I think the median because the number is lower	In golf youre trying the lowest score	4.0
Thats true in golf but do you think that it represents how he is as a golfer	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	I think the mean represents the	0.0
How come	Because the mean averages it in a more accurate Why because youre adding all the actual values out but then when youre using the median you use the number of values  represents all of the	4.0
Do you think there could be times when the mode could best represent the data	Yes	0.0
With mean mean does a better job of taking into account the times when he got much higher scores	Youre supposed to get low scores instead of high scores	0.0
In golf yes	Oh I thought you wanted to have the high scores	0.0
Oh I thought you wanted to have the high scores	You want it to take as little time as possible to get your ball intothe The ball into the hole thank you	0.0
You want it to take as little time as possible to get your ball intothe The ball into the hole thank you	You do not want a nine	0.0
You do not want a nine	Yes Carson	0.0
Yes Carson	I think that its good that were using the median	3.0
Crew lets listen please	because for the That were using the mean because the median just chops off the 10 and the 9 and the other 9and it also chops off the twos so it doesnt see any of his best or his worst and you need to be able to factor those parts in for it to be accurate	4.0
Whats your evidence for that	I see a few 12s and theres not really that big of data anywhere else other than that one 6th grader with 15	4.0
Evan what do you notice	That the 6th graders dont watch as many movies as the 7th graders and the 8th graders	3.0
Whats your evidence	I see that well the 7th graders have  and the 8th graders have twelves	3.0
How many twelves do they have	Six	3.0
That means that theyre watching about three movies a week	Wow	0.0
Wow	Thats not a lot thats three movies a week	0.0
Youre going to	I know something	0.0
Yes what do you know	The 8th graders median is 95	3.0
Lets see Colin and Abby can you be partners today	Sure	0.0
Ill put the data up here guys so you can see it easier	What were we supposed to say I think	2.0
Youre going to pick one number	Im sorry Id taken three	0.0
What did I just say	Use the sixth grade data to create a dot plot for the number of movies watched on Netflix	0.0
Use the sixth grade data to create a dot plot for the number of movies watched on Netflix	Number of movies watched on Netflix	0.0
Number of movies watched on Netflix	Yes	0.0
Okay I want you to say I think the typical number is  most is a confusing warning data	You said that it occurs to the right	0.0
If something happens the most what do we say	Largest range	3.0
What do you think the typical number is	Im so confused	2.0
Im so confused	About what	2.0
About what	Theres only 14 spots	3.0
Youre going to have some extras	What	0.0
Youre going to have some extras	Are you sure	0.0
Im positive	For 15	0.0
For 15	Theres two zeros one two it goes blank and then theres three ones so you would color one box in thats one then you see how many times two goes and then say two went three times then youd go up two	4.0
Theres two zeros one two it goes blank and then theres three ones so you would color one box in thats one then you see how many times two goes and then say two went three times then youd go up two	Theres up to three different typical	4.0
Theres up to three different typical	What	0.0
What	Theres both median or mean	3.0
Say that again I missed what you said	Zoe is saying that mode is typical but Im saying that any of these could be typical	1.0
Yes any of them but you have to look at them and decide which one of these do I feel like best represents my data	For me I felt that 4 was represented without any of this before I did this I felt that 4 best fit because I looked theres stuff a lot higher than 4 and theres stuff a lot lower than 4	4.0
For me I felt that 4 was represented without any of this before I did this I felt that 4 best fit because I looked theres stuff a lot higher than 4 and theres stuff a lot lower than 4	So Im going to say around 4 and then it turned out to be the mean so I trust that	4.0
Good job with this one	Theres not a 4 on anywhere on the data but it doesnt have to be on the data to have to be a mean	3.0
Theres not a 4 on anywhere on the data but it doesnt have to be on the data to have to be a mean	What happens if theres a gap	2.0
There shouldnt be a gap	But then how do you connect it	2.0
But then how do you connect it	Arent they supposed to stay connected	3.0
So 5 is going to look like this	Okay now that makes sense	0.0
Okay now that makes sense	Thank you Ms Davies	0.0
Tell me how you find your	Two 6s	4.0
Two 6s	Lets see you go over to the 6 twice	4.0
After you analyzed your data a little bit more do you still feel like 1 is your typical value	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	Yes	1.0
Yes	I didnt have one in the first place	3.0
Your response to number 1	I think the typical number is 4 because it is around the middle	4.0
Tom do you have something that you want to share	No we were just discussing	0.0
Okay what were you discussing	I thought it was 4 to start or something like that	3.0
I thought it was 4 to start or something like that	Yes I thought it was like 3 or 4 and then we decided it was 1	1.0
So they have a bunch of big plans	Whats the difference between a mayor and a president	0.0
Where you are guys going to put these black colored sheets	In your current unit	0.0
Who do you think is correct and why	I think Cat is correct because Dog the order of operation which is	4.0
If I write this problem out what do I need to do first Isaac	4 x 2	3.0
What mistake Carter did Dog make	He multiplied first	3.0
We should multiply first we need to	Sorry he added first	3.0
Im gonna tell you PEMDAS drives me a little bit crazy	Use GEMS	3.0
Nate you grab the door please	Sure	0.0
When we look at this problem what is the first thing that we should do Mia	We should add 3  2	3.0
We have a grouping symbol youre right what is 3  2	5	3.0
Okay what is my next step going to be Nate	Your next step for should be multiplication to division Youre going to have multiplication	3.0
Whats my multiplication problem I have there	Your multiplication problem is multiplication problem is 5 x 6	3.0
Whats 5 x 6	30	3.0
30	Oh I was looking at the blue	0.0
All right then everybody whats our final answer	28	3.0
28	28 is final answer	1.0
Who is correct	The cat again	3.0
The cat again	The dogs not	1.0
Blake do you know	I think the dog did 3  he did 3  2 or like no 6 x 2 and added a 3 and then no no no he did 32 and that equals 5 and then he did 6 x 5 and then I think he did forgot to do minus 2	4.0
Kayden what happened	He did 3  2  5 and then he did 62 which equals 4	4.0
He did 3  2  5 and then he did 62 which equals 4	Then he did 5 x 4  20	4.0
Whats 10 x 10	100	3.0
Awesome 5 x 5 what does that mean	25	3.0
Awesome 4 x 4 what is that	16	3.0
Okay what does 3 to the 4th tell you to do Nick	What you would have to do is do 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3	3.0
How many threes	Five 3s	3.0
This number up here tells us to only do four of them	Oh yes	0.0
What is 3 to the 4th or 3 x 3 x 3 times 3	It means to do that number 3 x 3  9	4.0
It means to do that number 3 x 3  9	Then you have to do 9 times 3 also	4.0
What is 9 x 3 Lexy	9 x 3 Yes 27	4.0
27 x 3	Oh	0.0
Oh	And that is 89	3.0
And that is 89	or is that 90	3.0
or is that 90	81	3.0
Which one of those three numbers	81	3.0
Austin do you agree disagree or not	I agree	1.0
What should we tackle first on this problem	First we should solve the exponent	3.0
Something before that	Oh 6 plus 2	3.0
Why do we do 6 plus 2 first	Its part of the grouping	4.0
Naomi what do we do next	2 to the 3rd power	3.0
Whats 2 to the 3rd power	8	3.0
Andrew what do I do next	8 you do times 2 which would be 8 times 2 which is 16	4.0
8 you do times 2 which would be 8 times 2 which is 16	Then its 8 plus 18 minus 16	4.0
Then its 8 plus 18 minus 16	Theres no more steps	0.0
Should we do 8 plus 18 or 18 minus 16	8 plus 18	3.0
Yes whats 8 plus 18	26	3.0
What is our final answer Ryan	Our final answer is 10	3.0
Oh your brain just grew	I have as 2 times 3 and then I realized it was actually 2 times 2 times 2 to begin with 2 times 3	4.0
Eli do you have something you like to add	I actually thought that the 6 plus 2 which is 8 times 2 was 2 to the 8	4.0
I actually thought that the 6 plus 2 which is 8 times 2 was 2 to the 8	That was my mistake	4.0
That was my mistake	Thats why I got 8	4.0
We realized Chloe what was this right here	10	3.0
I think 10 is zero or 10 is always that right	Yes	0.0
Hold on guys I cant hear Paige	Come back to me	0.0
Lexy	I found the one that was difficult was 25 and 4	2.0
25 and 4	Sorry I think its the LCM	0.0
Which number is that over here	Number eight	0.0
Can you help me with this one Lexy	Yes	0.0
Whats the common factor of 25 and 4	This is what I just put it as the last one that I did	3.0
This is what I just put it as the last one that I did	I didnt really figure it out	0.0
What are the factors of four	Two and one	3.0
Two and one and what else	Four	3.0
Are any of those factors of 25	One	3.0
Yes Nate	12 or 11 and 12	3.0
Yes thats perfect	All right	0.0
All right	Its fine	0.0
Like this one and this one yes it will work and 12 pieces	Is that okay to do throughout math	3.0
That works	Im just a little bit confused for the LCM of 12 and 8	2.0
Im just a little bit confused for the LCM of 12 and 8	Well I just didnt get because it says the plus 24 because theres a plus on the right side	2.0
I think thats just a different symbol	Okay	0.0
Do you want to go over that one of 12 and 8	Sure	0.0
Tell me whats a common factor of 12 and 8	Two	3.0
Whats 12 divided by 2	Six	3.0
Whats eight divided by two	Four	3.0
Do six and four have any common factors	Yes	0.0
What are they	Two	3.0

Okay and four divided by two	Two	3.0
If we wanted to find our least common multiple we could do 8 x 3 or 12 x 2 either way its 24	Okay	0.0
Yes Rose	I wanted to go over 16 and 4 finding the least common factor	2.0
It was that one over here	Yes	0.0
Yes	When I did it using the chart I started with two and I got eight and 12	4.0
When I did it using the chart I started with two and I got eight and 12	Then I went to four and I got four and three	4.0
Then I went to four and I got four and three	Here I got one and thats  I went to one and then get four and three	4.0
Here I got one and thats  I went to one and then get four and three	Then for the common factor	4.0
Can I stop you there for just a minute	Yes	0.0
Katie did you find it	Yes	0.0
Yes	Four goes into eight two times not four times	4.0
It would be eight	My question was even though I already had eight on it and	0.0
I bet the other one that went to eight when you had a mistake in it	Okay	0.0
What was yours	She can go	0.0
Okay	Why does he	0.0
I think its just a typo	Okay	0.0
Paige	I think it was what the GCF of 20 and 8 was	3.0
I think it was what the GCF of 20 and 8 was	Oh no	0.0
Martin for real last question	Okay	0.0
Okay	Well mine isnt actually a question	0.0
Well mine isnt actually a question	Its just a thought	0.0
Its just a thought	Three the answer had to be six I wonder what the numbers were because no other number could go through	4.0
That could be	Its impossible to get it to unless it was three	0.0

Whats 3  8	11	3.0
Now I would tell Nate just to be very careful that you know that you do addition and subtraction from left to right and multiplication and division from left to right as well	I think you do Im confused	2.0
Do we have any grouping symbols	I dont think so	0.0
Whats 2 x 2 guys	4	3.0
Whats 4 x 2	8	3.0
8 x 10 whats your final answer	80	3.0
What should I do first Nick	Do 106 because it is the first out of subtraction and addition	4.0
What do I do first	First you would 6 plus 2 because	3.0
What is 6  2	That would be 8	3.0
That would be 8	It would be 10  8	3.0
Which is what	Two	3.0
You have five minutes to do the next two problems to do four and five and if you finish early then skip over to nine	Nine or 10	0.0
Nine	You already given this one	0.0
Yes	Can we do a partner	0.0
For number four Elise what should I do first	You should do the multiplying 5 x 2	3.0
Yes which is what	Which is 10	3.0
Alan what do I do next	Next what you should do is divide	3.0
Divide what	Six by three	3.0
What do I do next Chloe	Then you do the 10 divided by 2	3.0
When I look at this I see an addition problem first	lets say its five plus 10 and thats 15	4.0
This one should have four plus 10	No	0.0
Which is 15 minus 2 to finish us off please Rachel	The 15 one	0.0
you have a question	Oh no I was just about the	0.0
What should we do first	The first step is grouping and number five plus is five	3.0
The first step is grouping and number five plus is five	Then it can be like	0.0
Thank you very much what do we do next Bryce	We do 32 by five	3.0
Reuben whats my final answer	50	3.0
What should I do first Maggie	Wait for steps	3.0
Oh six	Yes six and seven	3.0
All right go for it Paige	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	We start with the 10 plus three which is 13	4.0
Its also on the board over there if you ever want to Do we have any grouping symbols	Yes	0.0
Do we have any exponents	Yes	0.0
What are our exponents	Two	3.0
Four to the second	Yes	0.0
Whats four to the second	Eight	3.0
Not its not four times two its four times four	Oh then it would be 16	3.0
All right Blake what am I going to do next	I dont really get the steps	2.0
Do you see any multiplication or division	Yes	0.0
What do you see	Three times six	3.0
Now all we have left is addition and subtraction Isaac what should I do first	You should do 10 minus 18 because this would go from left to right	4.0
Miah what should I do next	Now you do 28 minus 16	3.0
Which is	8	3.0
8  1 whats my final answer	Nine	3.0
All right practice	I didnt	0.0
Yes Lexy	I didnt do it the way you did it and I got the wrong answer	0.0
I didnt do it the way you did it and I got the wrong answer	Can I say how I did that	0.0
I would rewrite it in right in using the correct steps here	Could you do it any other way like doing four to the second power later on	3.0
I will do it in the order that we did it so that you do get the correct answer	Four to the second and then	3.0
All right we have time to do one more together yes Mia	I didnt know eight 12	2.0
What is 12 plus one	13	3.0
There we go	I knew it	0.0
There we go	I got	0.0
I got	I got it	0.0

Brandon my question says find the GCF for 21 and 15	Three	3.0
Okay so you ask me your question	Find the GCF of 24 and 30	0.0
Lets say that I make my division ladder and I say I think the GCF is 2	Thats a common factor but not the greatest common factor	3.0
What was it 24 and 30	Yes	0.0
Then Im going to multiply 4 and 30 so 120	Is GCF	3.0
2 times 3 times 1 is 6	Yes	0.0

I understand they do not have electricity or running water	Wed have a microwave	0.0
Rylan what do you know about yurts	Well Ive been in one	0.0
Well Ive been in one	I went on a camping trip and it was a bit nicer with like	0.0
Ive never been in one but Ive seen pictures	Ive been in one that was like a building almost	0.0
Ive been in one that was like a building almost	It had like	0.0
I want you to also make sure that next to your yurt you have six people you have a drawing of six people	Are we doing it in this little space	3.0
Im just looking for you that it looks something like a tent and that there are six people who look pretty happy so you can give them smiley faces	Can I give them sad faces	0.0
Are they people who dont like to camp	Yes	0.0
Yes	Theyre people who dont like to camp	0.0
Theyre people who dont like to camp	Theyre in Colorado and theres like 7 ft of snow on top of them	0.0
Theyre in Colorado and theres like 7 ft of snow on top of them	Its Colorado	0.0

Yes	so we couldnt	0.0
so we couldnt	We brought smores but there was a microwave	0.0
We brought smores but there was a microwave	smores but they exploded all over the microwave	0.0
We can go Yes	Do you like to divide more or multiply more	2.0
Yes	For the yurt thing with the people and the yurts when you are timesing it by 2 I dont know how to say it but what part of the problem does that mean	2.0
For the yurt thing with the people and the yurts when you are timesing it by 2 I dont know how to say it but what part of the problem does that mean	Because we know the one and the six are the people in the yurt and timesing by 2 what	2.0
So that tells me that if I have two yurts I have twice as many people so I can have 12 people	Does it change like it doesnt have  its not something else	3.0
No its the same proportion	Okay	0.0
can you tell us how you might do that mentally	You first see the 200s	3.0
Good job keep going	Then 40 divided by 5 is 8	4.0
Yes Michael	Can I  another	0.0
Sure go for it	Since 5 is half of 10 what you can do is you can double when youre doing a times you split it in half	4.0
Since 5 is half of 10 what you can do is you can double when youre doing a times you split it in half	When you divide you just double it and you take off the zero	4.0
If he knew that there were 240 people and 40 yurts so Michael it sounds like the first thing you did was divide by 10 or did you divide by 2 first	What I did is  with 5 when you multiply you split the number in half then you add a zero	4.0
What I did is  with 5 when you multiply you split the number in half then you add a zero	But since youre dividing which is the opposite of multiplying you just do it times 2 basically and then you minus the zero	4.0
With a raised hand can you guys tell me why I want to add that information in the first column Bailey	get to 5 and 415	4.0
That means that Im going to be at 30 people so 5 yurts can accommodate 30 campers	Wait Never mind	0.0
What do you think this ones going to be	Subtracting a column	3.0
What I want to get to for my problem is 7	So you	0.0
If I take away 1 yurt how many people do I need to subtract		3.0
That would be correct but I would prefer to have more chaperones than	So that means to find out how many campers need chaperones we would add this number	3.0
Okay Im going to pull everybody back together because weve about	When youre done Im going to do the math	0.0
When youre done Im going to do the math	Im going to multiply	3.0
What questions can I answer for you guys	Wait	0.0
Wait	I told you it was	0.0
I told you it was	Im still confused	2.0
Whats your question Michael	We did the thing and it got to 180 people and 35	3.0
We did the thing and it got to 180 people and 35	No on the other problem	1.0
No on the other problem	Okay	0.0
Your side conversations needs to stop	which is 35 so isnt that how you get the 35 instead of 34	3.0
Who made that quacking noise	Its something in my bag	0.0
Go put it on my desk please	Cant I just shut it off	0.0
Let me see  what are the two things were comparing	8 and 24	3.0
If we look here what are the two objects or the two words were comparing	Tricks and treats	3.0
We want to get one of those values to one	Divide by eight	3.0
Cole what are you thinking	Two	3.0
Alicia what would it be	Four	3.0
Were training the dog looks like a hera to me what you guys think	A hound	0.0
Lena	It looks like Jack	0.0
That means every time he does one trick he gets three treats	Thats a lot of treats	3.0
It is	Most dogs	0.0
Figure out what can you do to get one of those values to one	Two	3.0
All right David what do you propose for	I say Holly gets for every one trick she gets four treats	3.0
Good tell me how you did that	I add the four and the 16 and I divided it by four	4.0
Jonah who is getting more treats	The rabbit	3.0
Oh whats your question	Since their treats are 13 and 14 then it would have to be a decimal point	4.0
Since their treats are 13 and 14 then it would have to be a decimal point	Are we going to use decimals	3.0
This bunny I dont know do bunnies rollover	Yes	0.0
Its just a comparison of two things rather than fractions theyre like a parttoa whole relationship	Im still confused	2.0
Im still confused	How do we put the hamsters treat ratio between three and four without going into decimals	2.0
Tell me what youre thinking so far	I think there may be	0.0
You could yes go for it Sophia	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	You could  decimals	3.0
Thats what youre asking instead of this thing like this one into decimal but what would the Hamster be	Oh maybe 135	3.0
If we do the hamster we do tricks to treats	For every one trick thats three and a half treats	1.0
Alicia	Thought it could be like a four to four	3.0
What do you mean four to four actually	For every	0.0
For every	Four to 11	1.0
Four to 11	Trick	0.0
Trick	Yes 11	1.0
Oh 11	That would be lower than all both	3.0
Do you know Damien	I dont know the actual number but I think that we could change the number of tricks that they do	3.0
Yes to what	To three	3.0
If we scale this up to three what happens	The we have to scale that up to 105	3.0
That would be two treats two tricks and how many treats	Seven	3.0
Youre right	the hamster gets more treats than	3.0
Theyre getting in the middle	Basically 1 and 35	3.0
That you see how it would be in the middle	Yes	0.0
Yes	That makes sense	0.0
Do you notice how we have two for all of these its a little bit easier to compare all of them	Yes	0.0
Im going to need a little bit of help remembering where we left off	Its 51 correct	0.0
We ended by talking about	That we had to take away a whole five students and one adult	3.0
We got 207 total people on the trip	Wait	0.0
Yes	You added which ones	2.0
We need to get our total number of students up to what number Crew	172	3.0
What do you guys think	Yes	1.0
Why does that make sense David	It makes sense because we have 38	1.0
It makes sense because we have 38	Dont we have 35 students	1.0
How do we know that we need to get this up to 172	Not sure	0.0
Whats up Andrew	Can I give a possible	0.0
Sure	75	3.0
Do you have any questions as were going through	Miss Davies	0.0
Yes	Why cant you do four	2.0
Why couldnt I multiply by four	Yes	0.0
Yes Rose	When you multiply the ones to the five instead of using 30 to the five could you also multiply  use the five on the bottom	3.0
Will you put the magnet in too	Yes	0.0
Yes	Im totally confusedhow you went back to the oneinstead of doing	2.0
Other people probably have this question	Yes	0.0
Yes Luna	You went back to the one why did you  in the first place	2.0
Yes	If you didnt have any directions telling you how would you know	2.0

We just know that we need to get our number of bars up to 130	100 what	2.0
100 what	130	3.0
What could we do first	Five	3.0
You could have done something else	Like 10	3.0
Remember were trying to get to 130	Yes	0.0
Yes	Could we multiply it by the first column	3.0
Wait  multiply that column we can add a column	Yes	0.0
Is there a number you think we can multiply that you get close to 130 to get the bars close to 130	Five	3.0
Whats 5 x 5	25	3.0
Whats 5 x 40	200	3.0
200	200	1.0
Do you think we need to go all the way to 200	No	0.0
Do you have a different proposal	Times by two and then add column one	3.0
Cole what are you thinking	Maybe you multiply by 3	3.0
How comes youre proposing three	I you do 3 x 4 that would be 12	4.0
I you do 3 x 4 that would be 12	Since its 40 it would be 120	4.0
Since its 40 it would be 120	Thats really close to 130	4.0
Chase do you like to coach Maria	Well you could add maybe the first column and then	3.0
Make sure youre coaching	You could see if you could add one of the columns maybe twice or	1.0
Sophia what are you thinking	You could see its in another column that you could use not just the 40	3.0
Andrew what do we need to do make sure that we have enough bars for everybody	You just add the one column one more time then you would need 17 boxes with six extra bars	3.0
To start multiplying by  then to subtract	Leave it in the comment section and subscribe to Pewdiepie and	0.0
I want to see them	I want to show you mine too	0.0
Wyatt what are you thinking	Its not a multiple that can get to a 100 you would have to multiply it by 100 and then divide by the number you started with	4.0
When you said it cant get to 100 what were you referring to	Eight	3.0
What did we call that number in the bottom	The denominator	3.0
Here what strategy could I use	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	You could divide by 10	3.0
Why would dividing by 10 work	You want to get the denominator to 10	3.0
You want to get the denominator to 10	That would be the quickest and easiest way to do it	3.0
Lucas if I divide both of my values both my number and my percent by 10 what am I going to get	The numerator will be five	3.0
The numerator will be five	The denominator will be 10	3.0
Dwayne you want to do it		3.0
How am I going to start by setting up my ratio table	I suppose what were going to do is were going to do 10 on the bottom  and then divide by	3.0
What are you thinking Andrew	Can you call on someone else because  It makes sense in my head the way I did it	0.0
Jackson what are you thinking	I think its 80100	3.0
Why	Because youre taking it out of like a whole level with that other one	4.0
Because youre taking it out of like a whole level with that other one	Youre kind of like trying to get it to 100 and this one here is the opposite	4.0
Youre kind of like trying to get it to 100 and this one here is the opposite	Youre trying to get it away from 100	4.0
What can I do to get it down to 10 Cooper	Divide by 8	3.0
What do you think Wyatt	I agree	1.0
Why do you agree	Because if you divide by 10 the bottom the denominator will be 10 then you would get your new number on the numerator	4.0
What would it be	Eight	3.0
What are you thinking	Do we have to simplify the fraction	3.0
If I ate 10 of a bag of MMs where there were 80 of them	Okay	0.0

Yes Cooper	Why cant 300 to get to 40	2.0
Why cant 300 to get to 40	You should divide by four	1.0
Yes Ben	I did the 75 divide by 75 does that work	3.0
You just do some work off to the side or think super hard to do it	Yes	0.0
Im not going to say it doesnt but its just much easier to do this	Will we get it wrong if we do it that way	0.0

What I would like for you guys to do is were going to do a couple of example problems here	That reminds me of	0.0
Julia	Unit price is asking how much is each lemon individually	3.0
Unit price is asking how much is each lemon individually	Like how much would technically one lemon be if it was like this thing	3.0
What is my unit price for lemons	How much money are you	3.0
Andrew what would be the cost of one lemon	25 cents	3.0
Tell us how you got that	Because 1 and 25 cents can be divided by 5 you just do that and you get 25 cents	4.0
Yes Jackson	I knew that four lemons are a 1 so if you add one more thats 20 and thats	4.0
How did you know four lemons were a 1	If you have four 25 cents is a 1 and then you have another 25 cents	3.0
Yes Ellie	I knew that 4 quarters equals 25 cents and 4 quarters make 1 so if you had another quarter it had 2	4.0
I knew that 4 quarters equals 25 cents and 4 quarters make 1 so if you had another quarter it had 2	Thats what I was trying to say	1.0
What is the unit price for 1 orange	How do you make a division	2.0
How do you make a division	How do you do	2.0
Lina go for it		4.0
	I think they are 75 cents because 75 plus 75 is 150 and then when you multiply it by 2 you get 300 then add it again	4.0
Do you agree disagree or have a question with any of the values on the board	I do agree with all the values	3.0
How do you know that all of those values are correct	Because I know half of 80 is 40	4.0
Does this represent half on your fraction bar	Yes	0.0
Yes	I know that 64 is 810 of 80	4.0
How did you find 110	Because I know 80 divided by 10 is 8	4.0
For every 110 on the fraction bar how much money has been raised	eight dollars	3.0
Harper do you agree disagree or have a question any of the values on number two	I agree with them	3.0
Which one do you agree with	I agree with the 72	3.0
How did you get that one	I kept adding 12	3.0

Emily what do you know	Shall I coach it or	0.0
Go for it	What I did is I found a number that you only had to double once to get to 24	3.0
What I did is I found a number that you only had to double once to get to 24	Thats how I got that	3.0
You could also say maybe half	Oh yes	0.0
What do you think about that	I think that makes sense	1.0
Amy what are you thinking	If we keep multiplying by 12 or adding 12 on so after 24 you get 36 you add 12 and after 36 you get 48 and then 60 and then if you add 12 to 60 you get 72	4.0
Mason whats another strategy	You could do 12 times 9 which would	3.0
Who has another different strategy	To get to 72	0.0
Anna lets hear it	You can count down	3.0
You can count down	You can subtract down	3.0
You have another one Luke	Yes	0.0
Lets hear it	You take 24 and then you double it and you double again	4.0
what are you thinking	You could do like 36 times 2	3.0
Anthony what are you thinking	Can I do it from getting to the question mark to	0.0
Henry do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	3.0
How do you know if thats correct	Because you can do 12 times 10 which is 120	4.0
Is it still recording Henry	Yes it still is	0.0
Oh sorry the problem said 12 to 24	3 12 and 24	3.0
Emily what did you write	Therere double amount of girls and boys	3.0
do you agree disagree or have a question with Emilys statement	I agree with Emily because I thought there is twice too many girls	1.0
Anna do want to share yours	I wrote for every 6 boys there are 12 girls	3.0
what do you think about that statement	I agree	1.0
How do you know	Because 2 times 6 is 12 and 2 times 12 is 24	4.0
Do you want to show yours Halina	Yes	0.0
Yes	I did for every one boy there is two girls	3.0
Ethan what do you think about that one	I did the same I did one boy is two girls	1.0
I got a ruler	This represents one part	0.0
Yes	Wouldnt Mr Lees class and all the other ones be 15 instead because youre doing it out of five cans	4.0
How many pieces do you have here	Four	3.0
This is represented in here so this might be orange juice apple juice pineapple juice blueberry juice I dont know	I thought it was grape juice	0.0
Good question	What if Mr Wills  28	3.0
Luke what you think	Mr Lees class	3.0
Why	Because 13 is greater than 14	4.0
Absolutely	Id agree with Luke	1.0
Id agree with Luke	Luke said the bar Is that a graph	0.0
Yes	The graph shows that its a little bit higher than this Ms Lukes and Mr Wills class	3.0
Yes	Oh yes because you only broke it up into three parts so theres more orange juice and then there is four parts because it fits into it less because its more	4.0
You can just tell me	Nine	3.0
Nine	I thought there was six	1.0
Nine I think too high	I think its seven	3.0
I think its seven	I did eight	1.0
What do you guys think for this one	I did eight	3.0
We have 10 plus 7 plus 9 I would say that around if you have a number around 26 for your total	I have 23	3.0
I have 23	I have 22	1.0
I have 22	I have	0.0
Yes	Were we supposed to add those together	3.0

I want you to flip over your paper	Its the same side	0.0
Im going to scooch down a little bit	day one	0.0
Michael what do you think	We can write it up as amount and use the fraction from there	3.0
How would you find how much 110 is	We could estimate or you use the ruler to measure how much it is	3.0
Max what do you think	I use my fingers to measure it out and then just move it back	3.0
That would totally work	Oh maybe you could use my pencil and then mark it	0.0
Scratch paper	Oh yes I have that	0.0
What are you thinking Zach	We could label 14 12 34 and then one whole	3.0
How is that going to help you find how much 14 is	You could divide the 14 by 300 or you could divide 300 by 4	3.0
Yes do you know what 300 divided by 4 is	It is 150	3.0
Keep going you want to divide in half one more time	Then 75	3.0
Okay	I think it would be easier to move this	0.0
You decide just take that with you where you go	Okay	0.0
Crew make sure you ask your partner  Do you agree  before switching your pencil over	Is this scratch paper our homework	0.0
Pardon me	Is this scratch paper our homework	0.0
Scratch paper	Because it says part of our homework	0.0
Agree disagree or have a question about one of our responses on the board	I agree with the first one phrase because on 14 if you multiply both of the numbers by two it gets you to 28 which is really close to the	4.0
So I heard you say that 14 is equivalent to 28	Yes	0.0
What is 12 how many 18 would that be	48	3.0
What might you say to them	I would say to make sure that you check what the numbers can be	3.0
Okay like equivalent fractions	Yes	0.0
All right Kylie agree disagree or have a question	I agree with four	1.0
What is 58 really close to	Its really close to 12	3.0
Yes so its sort of like we have 12 plus 12	Plus 18	3.0
How do you know that its a little bit bigger than one	Because its a little bit bigger	4.0
Which one	He knows that 58 is a little bit bigger than 18 and its a two	4.0
Quinn what would you like to add	To add on that I know that its more than one because 12 and 58 is more than 12 of an 88 so 12 plus 18 is more than a 12 is more than one its	4.0
What does that say	Is closest	0.0
Or closest to 510 which is 12	I dont know what that says	2.0
I hope you just figured that out	Yes I see it	0.0
Yes I see it	I understand it	0.0
Whats a question that you think someone could ask if theyre not sure how to solve this problem	I think I know	0.0
Jason whats the question you might ask if you needed help starting with number two	What would 58 be closest to in a fraction	3.0
Maybe we could also think about it like money	Yes like its 58 cents	3.0
Whats 58 cents close to	50	3.0
50	50	1.0
Its close to 50 cents	Then you could like round it down	3.0
Yes we could round down 58	Yes	0.0
How much bigger would it be	Wait you mean in decimals	0.0
What do you think Brody	810 wait	3.0
Thats for like 80 cents is the 80 cents bigger	No	0.0
No	Oh wait 8000 wait	3.0

What place that is in between 10ths	8100	3.0
What do you think Kylie	Wait	0.0
Wait	Yes	0.0
Its 8100ths bigger	Okay I was like yes	0.0
Yes Caroline	I think it would be a lot closer to the fourths not too far from one here	3.0

It wasnt that hard but it took me a little while on number three like the total hours worked	The total hours worked it wasnt that hard it was just	0.0
48 and	Six	3.0
It should even out at six right	Yes	0.0
Total number is 48 divided by 8 what do you get when you divide 48 by 8	Six	3.0
Royal	I have a problem with doing it figuring out the number of people Ryderples mean and then multiply them together	2.0
16	Its 16	0.0
For this one	Its 10	3.0
Well look where your line is	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	I thought it was supposed to be borrowed as over like you showed them and	0.0
Margie you were saying thats what took a while right	Yes	0.0
All right lets see what 12 times 16 is	Its 192	3.0
Finn	Do we have any upcoming tests	0.0
Do we have any upcoming tests	Because I noticed that the graph factors and multiply  is next unit and we had just finished this note factor and so and so and	0.0
Has any of you tried surfing before	Im really good at it in whiteboarding	0.0
How many threes	Three	3.0
What was that	Four	3.0
Four and how did you find that	Four minus zero is equals four	4.0
Next one	Two	3.0
Theres only one three	Four	3.0
Theres four fours and an eight	There are three fours	3.0
There are three fours	There are three fours	3.0
Ryder who do you think	Bob because he is so much better at surfing than Ben and Ben is not very good at surfing	4.0
Bob because he is so much better at surfing than Ben and Ben is not very good at surfing	Bob has a much better mode than he does and	4.0
What is the mode for Bob	One and four	3.0
One and four	Four and one	3.0
Roy what do you think	I think Bob is better because again he has a mode thats four and then he also has an eight surfing time thats pretty good	4.0
Whats the range for Bob	Seven	3.0
Now what do you think	I think Ben is better because even though he got less that means he takes his time more	4.0
Whats the next one	Two	3.0
Does everybody agree thats the same list as what we have over here	Yes	1.0
Yes	Are we going to draw the box over there	0.0
Are we going to draw the box over there	Were going to draw the boxes in a moment but before we draw the boxes I want to talk about median because today I really want to focus on the difference between median and mean	0.0
Do I need to draw any of these bars to find median	No	0.0
Right now you can mark it on your paper but whats the middle of this list up here	Two	3.0
Is it in between two and two	Yes	0.0
Everybody agree its right there	Yes	1.0
Whats in between two and two	Two	3.0
Did anybody think it was going to be 25	No	0.0
I know some of you already did that	Can we start finding the mean	0.0
Is this skewed at all	No	3.0
I just want to say that you cant talk about skewed from that but you can talk about skewed or symmetric from this	Thats one thing we can put down on our note catcher	0.0
Did everybody remember to move it to zero	Yes	0.0
If you do this it should work out perfectly evenly and whats the mean	Two	3.0
You could draw the mean line in and its got two	So the mean is the same as the median	3.0
Sean	Two	3.0
Two	Oh its the mode	0.0
Mode	Three	3.0
Are these different than the mode	Yes	0.0
For mean I want you to move these to the small ones and see how youre going to go about it	Oh	0.0
Draw an arrow switch them and then youll use because were going to use that third one for Bobs friend Seth	I got the median	0.0
Yes Salem	Do we have to do Seth	0.0
Just looking at median does that tell us that Bob is a better surfer than Ben	Yes	0.0
Eric you good back there	Yes	0.0
Where is the mean line at	Three	3.0
Are these the same	No	0.0
Looking at these numbers can we pretty much conclude that Bob is a better surfer than Ben	Yes	0.0
Mariana	Make a list of the numbers up above	3.0
Over here	Of the data	3.0
Three three three and one more three and three fours	Make a line pop	3.0
Margie you already told us the range for this one	Oh ah ooh	0.0
What was the range for Bobs	Seven	3.0
Whats the range for Seths	Three	3.0
Sean what does that mean	Youre consistent	3.0
Maggie	Four	3.0
And in the list up here its in between these two fours	Just four	3.0
Is this median the highest of all of them	Yes	0.0
Maggie you all good	Yes Im just trying to	0.0
What I noticed here yes Shannon	Well Ive got the answers	0.0
For mean	Yes	0.0
What I noticed here is does Seth have way more boxes than these people	Yes	0.0
Shannon what did you say for mean	I said its four	3.0
Is that the highest mean out of everyone	Yes	0.0
I would say that Seth is probably the best surfer out of all four of them	Yes Seth is pretty good	0.0
Now what if we just based whos the best surfer based on who has the best the longest time	Then Bob would be	3.0
Bob has the maximum he has the biggest surf time out of everyone	Ive had a 12 minute whiteboard time	0.0
12 minute	Yes like behind a boat	0.0
Thats a little different than surfing though because you dont get to	Because you dont have to go you dont have to stand all the way	0.0
Can you fill it out though	Why does it stay on you	0.0
Because I have this thing	Well why does it have to stay on you	0.0
Well because Im moving around	Im just going to unduck and then Ill just look at him	0.0
Silas	I think Seth because he has the biggest mean and median	4.0
Salem	I think that Seth is better because his mean and median were real high than the others	4.0
Salem can you say it again	I think that Seth is better because his mean and his median were real high than the others	4.0
Marilyn	I think Seths better because his range is the smallest so his times are very consistent	4.0
Okay Mariana last one	I think that it is Seth because he has the highest mean and median but it could also be Bob because he has the highest score or the highest time	4.0
Raise your hand Im going to give you two choices teams or individual	Teams	0.0

And then quadrant four is positives and negatives	Wait	0.0
Wait	Is the positive X and then the negative is Y for that	3.0
For quadrant four	Yes	0.0
The second number is always Y	Okay	0.0
Is  so far done	Will you increase the numbers in that quadrant thing or you will just go straight because its positives	2.0
And then we re going to graph these points and see how this compares to the other one	Should we graph it	0.0
These are four other points	It s like double the shape	3.0
We double the X and we double the Y	Just like in Mug Wump	3.0

How many of these shapes do you think will fit in the red shape	Can you show us	2.0
I m just going to do it over here just to make it a little bit more clear	It s two	3.0
There s a lot of space up there right	Three	3.0
It s not going to work out perfectly	Four	3.0
Four	It s about two	1.0
It should be	Four	3.0

Anybody remember	2X 2Y	3.0
Does Zug pretty much look like Mug Wump	Yes	0.0
One other thing I want you to notice is that is this angle the same as this angle	Yes	0.0
Is this angle appear the same as this angle	Yes	0.0
Lug what was the rule for Lug	3XY	3.0
Are these angles the same as on those two shapes	No	0.0
If you think about on a computer have you ever made a picture bigger and all of a sudden you actually drag it too far to the side and it just looks super weird	Then it looks like lug	3.0
Then GLug	It was X3Y	3.0
Are these angles the same	No	0.0
Roger	Is there a more than one definition because thats the one with two up there	0.0
Is there a more than one definition because thats the one with two up there	Are there going to be more when you make more shapes on a graph is there going to be different definitions or is it just going to be similar or distorted	2.0
This one	and minus the one thats 3 times X and Y	4.0
and minus the one thats 3 times X and Y	Would you feel that it got the original	0.0
Lucille asked if we subtracted these two would you get back to the original	No	0.0
I think no because this is almost a 90degree angle and if you take that away from this angle you get back to really small angles	No if you add them together  and divide it by six	4.0
No if you add them together  and divide it by six	Why six	2.0
Im not sure	When you say the rule you mean 2X 2Y or XY	2.0
Rory	What if you started out with Bug and tried to smaller	2.0
You can start with a shape and you can get smaller and it could still be the same type of shape just like on a computer when you put a picture and youre like  Oh that picture is too big  you make it smaller same deal still similar	Would that be like negative three	3.0
The first thing is a couple years ago I made a GeoGebra app	Whats a GeoGebra	2.0

Okay table two every time x goes up by one is y going up or down by the same amount	No	0.0
Is that a straight line	No	0.0
Okay so your equation for this one is y equals x squared or y equals x times x which is kind of weird were not going to talk about these for a while after this but you might see them a little bit	Hey I got x by x	3.0
Good	Could it be a constant of proportionality like for table number three it doesnt go to zero then but it would eventually go to zero	4.0
No because for number three	Yes	0.0
Does 10 times 5 get you to this one	No	0.0

Its not very slow but its also not the fastest run that you could possibly do	How long  his age	0.0
What about 5 meters per second	20	3.0
20 seconds I would say its like if anyone in here was to run either as fast as they could I dont know it depends on how fast you are but itd probably be around 20 seconds for the 100meter dash	So goes for my grandpa to	0.0

It needs to have the starting amount and whats happening every week	Money equals 14 minus a week	3.0
Money equals 14 minus a week	Or times a week by 12	3.0
So its 12	Youre going up by 10	3.0
SS right thank you	Can you go up by either 10 or 12	3.0
Youre going to have to figure out a way to put the 144 in the relation	Are you SSowed to go above the graph	0.0
Sure	Write an equation that represents the relationship M money and W for weeks	0.0
Thats a good option	Explain information	0.0
start at 144 and take away	Im not erasing that	0.0
Im not erasing that	I just know that its that	0.0
I just know that its that	Money equals one	3.0
Youre subtracting and then  Whats happening every week	Every class hes like this	0.0
You can go grab your homework	I dont get the equation because I know it	0.0
I dont get the equation because I know it	144 minus quantity of 12 No 144  12 times the number times W 144	4.0

Otis	12	3.0
Did that help a little bit with your question	A little bit but which one is rise and which one is run	2.0
Rise is up and down so its a vertical line and run is the side to side	All right that helps	0.0
All right that helps	Thank you	0.0
Melvin	I have a question	0.0
I have a question	Is it possible for both rise and run to be negative in a regular graph	3.0
Whos got an equation	No I dont have an equation but why is it 1	2.0
Because its going down from left to right	If its going up	0.0

Micha and	For number two or Y and B in the equation do I have to write Y equals	3.0
You should always have the Y equals part	Would it be correct without	0.0
An equation needs an equal sign in it so if you dont have the equals sign then you only have part of the equation	What if its a	0.0
Miles	For line A Y are proportional and linear circled	3.0
Its proportional so when it says circle one I think the best answer is proportional	Its also linear	3.0
If its proportional its also definitely linear	Right	0.0
Niki	For the equations is it always going to be Y equals or whatever the dependent variable is	2.0
Okay	When the dependent is the	0.0
The amount of money depends on how far the walk the distance	Oh okay	0.0
Okay	Yes	0.0
Ivanna	On line C is it okay if I wrote Y X  5 or is that not correct	3.0
X  5 would mean that its going up by 1 every time	Okay	0.0
You can write Y 0X  5	Oh I did that	0.0
Oh I did that	That works	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Nova	For those graphs up there theyre all the same but mine was different	3.0
For those graphs up there theyre all the same but mine was different	Were we supposed to meet all the graphs is the same	0.0
I try to make it so you could go up by ones but you didnt want to go by ones thats fine	Do they have to be the same	0.0
Because it says label each axis for each one so its whatever you wanted to do could work	Okay	0.0
Melvin	Where it shows W but couldnt you also do X even its only becoming from the same number here	3.0
Sure	Yes I like to put X in sometimes	0.0
It might not be as accurate for that situation but its still the equation	If that was on the final do we have to write it under the	0.0
You should try to use	per week	0.0
Thats a little bit more drastic	But it says four weeks	0.0
Say theyre getting paid every day then Kaia would have more money	were setting this up per week	3.0
Yes	Because like at the end of  you get paid after	0.0
This one the nice thing	It just gives the Yintercept	3.0
The Yintercept is  ld like you to write that in on your page	Can we write the seven on the third one	0.0
What does it go up by for Y	Three	3.0
Goes up by three	Do you have to do the 1s	0.0
Piper what do you think	Y43X	3.0
Ramsey	3x4	3.0
First of all is there a Yintercept in there	No	0.0
Lets write in our ratios for rise and run	Theres no Yintercept	0.0
There is but its on the table	No	0.0
Yes because theres no 0 for X right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Should X be seven	3.0
Down here	Yes	0.0
So X goes up by two here Y goes what	Up by 6	3.0
Up goes up by 6	No	0.0
X goes up by how many here	2	3.0
2 and up by	6	3.0
X goes up by	3	3.0
3and y goes up by	9	3.0
9 is that the same ratio	Yes	0.0
26 is the same as 39	Yes	0.0
Okay and then X goes up by	1	3.0
1 and	3	3.0
Your slope is 31 or you could do 93 or you could do 62 its all the same thing and you get 3 again for your slope	Do you have to break the 31	0.0
It might not always be the case but it depends	31	3.0
In between the 3 In the 5 we should write 4 SS agree with that	Yes	0.0
Okay what do you think that the Y value is for 2	5	3.0
What do you think the Y value is for 4	11	3.0
Notice how this connects to the slope from 2 to 5 what is it plus what	3	3.0
3 what about from 5 to 8	3	3.0
8 to 11	3	3.0
11 to 14	3	3.0
Ty what do you think	Y3X1	3.0
All right people last table	I wrote it differently	2.0
How did you write it differently		3.0
What are we going up by here	3	3.0
What are we going down by here	7	3.0
What are we going up by here	1	3.0
What are we going down by here	2	3.0
Plus what	3	3.0
Plus 3	Then down 6	3.0
Down 6 so thats the same ratios here and then last one	1	3.0
1 and then	2	3.0
Ivanna	It will be 2	3.0
What would be the Y value here	13	3.0
13	Yes	0.0
What if we work backwards all the way to 0	19	3.0
19	Not 19	3.0
SS agree with that	Yes	1.0
Yes	Why are you making it go down by 2 because thats the slope	2.0
Melvin youve got an equation for us	Yes	0.0
Yes	Y 192X	3.0
Have we done I to the L	Yes	0.0
Have we done L and with like	Yes	0.0
Have we done peace up and Aokay	No	0.0
On three we are going to switch	That one is easy	0.0
That one is easy	I just did it first try	0.0
Okay three two one switch	I am so good you have no idea	0.0

Melvin can you tell us that equation one more time	Y 19 2X	3.0
Otis	Y 2X  19	3.0
Neil are we doing okay	Yes	0.0
Are we doing okay	Yes	0.0
For the first two we are going to use the help of a graph and for the last two were not going to use a graph	Can we use ratio tables for the last two	3.0
The Yintercept is  and the slope	Is 2	3.0
Paisley	Y 1  2X	3.0
what did you say Paisley	I said 1  2X	3.0
Is it how he said	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes thats what he said	1.0
Can we write 2X  1	Yes	0.0
You can what Paisley said 1  2X or you can do 2X  1	What would happen if we then wrote Y 2X	2.0
Then that does not account for the Yintercept for you	Then it starts at	3.0
Instead of  Harriette question	In here it doesnt really matter if you do 1  2X or 2X  1 but like how the dollar sign before the number its not really wrong if you do it after the number but most people do it before	2.0
In here it doesnt really matter if you do 1  2X or 2X  1 but like how the dollar sign before the number its not really wrong if you do it after the number but most people do it before	Is there a way like that with this	2.0
First of all is this increasing or decreasing	Decreasing	3.0
Then could someone help us out why is this problem more challenging than the first problem	Because its easy	0.0
Melvin why is this one more challenging	We dont know where the Yintercept is	4.0
Yes you dont know where the	There is a way we can know where it is but its not on the grid	3.0
Whats the run	3	3.0
3	3	1.0
3 and what is the rise	9	3.0
9	9	1.0
9	9	1.0
Melvin a question	Does it always have to whole numbers	3.0
No but I think the nice thing about drawing the triangle	I see a 25 first	3.0
I see a 25 first	Yes I thought it was 25 before I did the	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
We are going to go to 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7	Only up to 7	0.0
I want to show you the strategy first	I have a strategy	0.0
I have a strategy	I have a strategy too	0.0
Does everybody agreed these are our two starting points	Yes	1.0
Then what about this one	Thats 3	3.0
Down 3 down 3 down 3	Then if its around there it will be negative	4.0
Then if its around there it will be negative	So for like 8 here is a negative	4.0
Can I work backwards in the table	Yes	0.0
What do I need to add every time if Im going backwards	3	3.0
Ramsey	Is it always like this once you find out that 3 each time	0.0
Is it always like this once you find out that 3 each time	The last point that you have in the graph is 7 x 3  21	4.0
Otis you are with me	Yes	0.0
Okay Miles you have an equation for us	Yes	0.0
Yes	Y  21 3X	3.0
Anybody have another equation Ivanna	3X 21	3.0
feeling like we were a little distracted today but I understand its the end of the day	If it was like Y 21 2X any number X can you also do like Y 21 X to the square	4.0
Id like you to draw a table X Y going sideways table	Is this a ratio table	3.0
Whats the biggest X value out of those two points	7	3.0
Whats the jump from 4 to 7	3	3.0
Whats the jump from 3 to 18	15	3.0
What do you get	5	3.0
3 5 what	8	3.0

23	How can this equation help you	0.0
How can this equation help you	Three	0.0
Three	It must be really small	0.0
It could be any different number but	Theres always 11	3.0
Wynn what do you think	I counted out the coins and theres 5 coins next to the pouches	4.0
I counted out the coins and theres 5 coins next to the pouches	Then I did the 11  5	4.0
Then I did the 11  5	Then since theres two pouches and 11  5  6 I did 6  2 and then that equals 3	4.0
Those six coins get split between two pouches so then you divide it by two at the end right	Yes	0.0
Underneath your problem lets write pouch  3	Can you say it on the box	0.0
How many pouches do we have	Two	3.0
Five so we are going to write  five and right there does this look like an equation that weve been working on	Yes	0.0
Thats our equation for this first problem	Wait	0.0
Yes Abel	Would the X be representing this number of coins inside the bags	3.0
2X part means theres two of them	Two and the number of coins	3.0

Elijah dont touch that	Wait I  anything	0.0
Look you  what strategy it is	For the equation	0.0
First how do we even get an answer	Can I just say what the answer is	0.0
Sure	In these bags are four coins	3.0
How did you figure that out	Well theres 12 overall coins and theres 4 outside of the bag	4.0
Well theres 12 overall coins and theres 4 outside of the bag	I did 12  4 which equals eight	4.0
I did 12  4 which equals eight	Then 8  2 because theres 2 bags	4.0
Its the same	No its not	0.0
Abel	Can I do the equation	0.0
Sure you can do the equation	2X  4	4.0
2X  4	2X because theres two pouches plus 4	4.0
2X because theres two pouches plus 4	12	4.0
Does everybody agree that those are two of the same thing	Yes	1.0
Could I take half of this one as well	Yes	0.0
If a pouch and two coins  6 coins is that really the same answer	Yes	0.0
Could this be written as X  2 over here	Yes	0.0
Does everybody agree that means pouch plus two coins	Yes	1.0
How many sections of that did we have to start	Its two	3.0
Abel	Say this problem was on a test or something would both equations both work be the answer to the problem	3.0
Laim	What if you have an uneven amount of coins on the other side	2.0
Ready to try another one	Yes	0.0
Archer whats your equation	3X  3  30	4.0
Oliver what do you think	In these ones the quantity of X  1  30	4.0
What is my number	Thats the same one	3.0
Thats the same one	Thats the same thing nine	3.0
Abel	I was going to do the steps	0.0
What is it	The way I did it was I Since one of the sections is 10 total if you divide	3.0
Hold on a second because I dont know if we can think about it that way just from the word part	Wait are we asking how to do this	0.0
Abel	You start with 30	4.0
You start with 30	You subtract 3 from 30 which is 27	4.0
You subtract 3 from 30 which is 27	Then you divide it by three because it said triple and you go backwards and you get nine	4.0
Does that sound like the steps that we just did	Yes	0.0
Do those sound like the same steps that we just did	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0

I crossed out the extra change	Then the pouches and nine	4.0
Sure to solve it	Then two pouches then two pouches here so you cross out that cross out those two and cross out those two and you are left with one pouch and nine coins	4.0
Then there are at least two pouches on both sides	Thats what I did	0.0
Thats what I did	That makes it so much easier	0.0
That makes it so much easier	I went up from three	3.0
Then you might notice now theres one pouch and its equal to	Nine	3.0

Kind of	I solved it the same way exactly the same but with the equation	1.0
With the equation	I solved it with the coin and only crossing out two coins and only crossing out two bags and then crossing out two coins on that side and the two bags	4.0
You only did it by crossing out two coins	Yes	0.0
Here	I crossed out two coins and then I crossed out Yes two coins on that side	4.0
I crossed out two coins and then I crossed out Yes two coins on that side	I crossed out two bags and two bags and then I	4.0

Less than would be the same as greater than	No	0.0
What would be a simile for greater than	More than	3.0
How do you know that the answer is no Sophia	Because of 45x950	4.0
Tera	Because youre doing what 45x9 but then youre subtracting	4.0
Because youre doing what 45x9 but then youre subtracting	Then it cant be greater than that same problem when youre subtracting	4.0
How do you know its yes Nessa	Because youre doing 45x9 and then youre adding 8	4.0
This is not acceptable	to your answer	0.0
Bruce	I know the answer is yes because it would be greater because youre adding	4.0
Youre adding	No youre multiplying that number that you get	3.0
Youre comparing it to	Yes	0.0
By	By multiplying	3.0
Youre multiplying it by what	By two	3.0
Abby you think it is less than why do you think so	Because the answer youre aiming for	0.0
Mika why did you know the answer is yes	Because its being divided by two so thats only half to 798212	4.0
Asher how do you know	Because youre dividing it into two groups so I know its exactly half	4.0
Clay how do you know that the answer is no	Because if its times two its going to be double instead of half as much	4.0

Tell me about how you figured out the hundredth	the hundredth	0.0
How did you decide what to do here	Theres one two three four five and I counted all the tenths and then I counted the ones	3.0
You made the tenths first	Yes	0.0
Is this 54	Yes thats 54	0.0
We have Oh wow tell me about how you did the 33 again	I  six right here and then I get 26 and then 26 plus seven equals 33	4.0
Do you guys see that	Yes	0.0
Tell us what you did Angela	First I highlighted the 33 and then I  so I put a four here and then I colored  after	3.0
Is your different	The way I did it is different	1.0
Is that the most interesting one or do you want to talk about a different one	Just that one	0.0
Just that one	What I did is I just first brought down the 33 and then there is  plus seven so	3.0
Please dont do that	Seven plus three seven three and then when I got to this part I just brought down	4.0
There should have been 54	I just made 10 by doing the seven here and then three down here and then I drew seven three	4.0
The only other thing that I was looking for and I dont think anybody did it was there arent any rights or wrongs but just to have shaded them next to each other and then Can I share yours	Yes	0.0
What did you notice about it	They use two grids	3.0
Can you please tell us about it Vicki	I shaded in 64 hundredths and then I knew that I need to cross out three tenths so I crossed out 3 rows of 10	4.0
What was the answer	The answer was 34 hundredths	3.0
Will you come show	I kind of	0.0
Youre just going to explain it differently	Yes	0.0
Yes	Here are my two colored pencils and I colored you cant really see it but thats both of the colors and thats just pink and I colored in 64 hundredths first and then I used my other colored pencil and colored in the three tenths that I needed to cross out then I subtracted	4.0
Do you guys all understand what she did	Yes	0.0
Come show us	So I did	0.0
You did what they did	Actually I did differently	1.0
Good	We used that one	4.0
We used that one	I said orange is our starter like what we started with and then yellow is what were subtracting	4.0
I said orange is our starter like what we started with and then yellow is what were subtracting	It doesnt show very well but that is 64	4.0
It doesnt show very well but that is 64	64 and this is three tenths and	4.0
Audrey	I think I did	0.0
How are you going to show how are you going to use the shading to indicate what your answer is	Then we did what  showed	0.0
Its page 146	This what	2.0

What was your strategy	I added 17 to 46 and then I added the dollar	4.0
Did you do like place value	Yes	0.0
You started with the 146 then what	Then I added the dollars first then I added the cents which would be	3.0
Missy what did you use	I did  so what I did was I added  to get 13 then I added the  to get 5 then I added 1	4.0
Did you do it	I have	0.0
Go Nessa	Yes	0.0
You bring down the decimal	Yes I did	0.0
Now youre going to start in the hundredths place	This is	0.0
What	This is the perfect because I usually go to the strip my mom always have before the change come back she always has  estimate what I think the change will be	0.0
Lisa what is the answer and how did you get it	I got 781	3.0
What strategy did you use	traditional	3.0
All right so can you tell us what you did	I used	0.0
This one	You can do zero minus nine and there are all  numbers with you  to take it from the two and make that into a one and then to make it into a 10	4.0
You can do zero minus nine and there are all  numbers with you  to take it from the two and make that into a one and then to make it into a 10	Then I got one and I did that for the rest of them	4.0
She	Aligned	3.0
Yes come show us	I started with 1219 and I added 081 to make it just dollars	3.0
Yes	and so you have to deal with the cents	4.0
and so you have to deal with the cents	I know 7  3 is 10	4.0
I know 7  3 is 10	Just to get to 20 I will just have to add add 7	4.0

Paul	I just want So wouldnt that be four ninths becauseBruce said Im pretty sure thats how many of the squares there are but its not how much the perimeter is	4.0
Perimeter is something totally different than what were talking about but youre talking about the length of the edges right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Not the inside	3.0
This would be two thirds by two thirds and the area of the shaded rectangle is how much Vicki	Four ninths	3.0
You missed a lesson yesterday so youre welcome to ask for a friends help	I think the answer is four ninths because theres nine in the whole and shaded four of the nine	4.0
Penny did you have something else	You can just do two times two which is four and then three times three which is nine	4.0
If you just use the algorithm that you proved yesterday two what would your number sentence be	It would be two thirds times two thirds equals four ninths	3.0
Did you work withTera	I knew the that it was two thirds and  so I folded it three ways	4.0
I knew the that it was two thirds and  so I folded it three ways	I folded it like this first and then I had to color it again because there was another two thirds and I folded it long way	4.0

33	34	3.0
34	I took out 23 and 34 and then times by the line and then to make it	4.0
I took out 23 and 34 and then times by the line and then to make it	Then I became easy and I shaded it all and then I double shaded this part	4.0
Any questions for Mariah	I dont think so	0.0
Nessa do you have a question for her	Yes how did the denominator	2.0
Yes how did the denominator	We had to multiply you need to get the answer	4.0
We had to multiply you need to get the answer	I did 34  23  612 because 3  2  6 and 4  3  12	4.0
Does her picture prove that 34  23 are 612	No because  isnt shaded twelves it shows two parts	1.0
This is the same as 3  2 over 4  3 to get 612 right	I didnt	0.0
Im going to go to the next Lets see if I can find it in the last one	Thats the same	0.0
Thats the same what	That same one	0.0
Using that work	I have absolutely no idea	0.0
First I would Marco	You would divide the square into thirds and then this	3.0
Then	You would add on this drawing	3.0
In the opposite direction so then youd have thirds in one direction and fifths in the other right Marco	Yes	0.0
Then what	Then you figure out what fractions are those	4.0
Then you figure out what fractions are those	In this case it will be fifteenths	4.0
Then you put that in	Yes	0.0
Thirds this way and Id label it	Yes	0.0
What did you say fifths the other direction	Yes	0.0
Then	You multiply 3  5 and that would equal 15 so its fifteenths	4.0
What do I shade	You find the tick mark for 13 then you share the square right there and you use it	4.0
You find the tick mark for 13 then you share the square right there and you use it	Then you find the 23 or 35 then you shade all of it between 13 and 35	4.0
Touch your shoulder partner dont do anything and just explain what you think the answer is and why	10	3.0
10 and how do you know	Because I know that 5  2 is 10 for the numerator	4.0
Because I know that 5  2 is 10 for the numerator	Then from  the numerator times the numerator	4.0

Dont tell me tell them	We built a bookshelf that was 6 feet tall and 12 yard wide and list what is the area of that bookshelf	4.0
We built a bookshelf that was 6 feet tall and 12 yard wide and list what is the area of that bookshelf	Multiplication of that you do 6 x 12	4.0
They said 6 x 12	Or 12 yard	3.0
It seems like youd have some questions	That if youre multiplying it by 12 yard technically it would be 1 12 feet not just a 12 foot	3.0
That if youre multiplying it by 12 yard technically it would be 1 12 feet not just a 12 foot	Yes but its in 12 yard	1.0
Yes but its in 12 yard	They said 12 of them you carry and then put it in the yard	1.0
By six what	By six	3.0
Michael what do you think	To multiply them you have to convert them to inches first because they need to have the same unit	4.0
Oh so	We did	3.0
We did	We said that 6 feet 2 yards because 3 feet go into a yard so itd be 2 yards so 2 yards x 12 of the yard	4.0
6 feet  2 yards so they converted that first so its 2 yards x 12 yard is the area of their bookshop got it	Yes	0.0

I think they could change it to Johnny had 8 and then he spent 23 on the fish because it seems like they bought the fish with extra money	Then when they were done with that they had 8 left	4.0
If you multiply 8 by 23 what would the question be	Johnny had 8 he spent 23 of the money on a fish	3.0
Johnny had 8 he spent 23 of the money on a fish	How much money does he have left	3.0
What do you guys think about that	How much money he spends	3.0
Oh what did you say Joyce	Thats how much money he spends	3.0
On	On food	3.0
Your table	A man had 45 of 8 he spent 14 of that money to get a tooth drill	3.0
A man had 45 of 8 he spent 14 of that money to get a tooth drill	How much money did he spend	3.0
Are we multiplying 14 x 45	Well its	0.0
Times eight	Yes because you  8 and then you have to find out the 14 of that	3.0
14 x 45 14 x 45 of Good	Johnny bought a pizza when he came home magically 15 disappeared so he had 12 15 of a pizza he only wanted to eat 14 how much should he eat	4.0

What would a number model be for number two	One divided by three	3.0
Clay what would a number model be for number two	One divided by three equals one third	3.0
Did you do a representation or a picture for that	No	0.0
No representations you all did it in your head	I did it	0.0
Okay Zoey whatd you do	I drew a string and I cut it into three parts	3.0
How is problem three similar	Well its not really that similar its half and those ones are wholes	3.0
Well its not really that similar its half and those ones are wholes	But the answer still comes out of there	1.0
All right Penny hows problem three similar to numbers one and two	Problem three is similar to problems one and two because each time youre splitting it into three equal pieces	4.0
If we think about division the three is	This divisor	3.0
What would a number model be for number three Lisa W	For number three maybe one half divided by three	3.0
Talk to your table group	That way you could count how many pieces there are	3.0
Finn I could call on you for this	I dont even know	0.0
Well youre not going to know if you dont even try	How am I supposed to know	0.0
How am I supposed to know	How do I know something if I dont have to try	0.0
Finn is the answer going to be do you think the answer is going to be more or less than what we started with	Less because youre multiplying by a fraction	4.0
We are	Dividing by	3.0
Laura what do you think	You could do what you did on that side on the other side	3.0
Yes so split this into three parts as well	And count how many pieces there are	3.0
A half divided by three is what Asher	Six	3.0
Six	I mean one sixth	3.0
What do you call the answer	Quotient	3.0
We know that the quotients going to be smaller than the what is this	The dividend	3.0
I need Cooper Mariah and Annie	Okay	0.0
What are we dividing	Were dividing one third and	3.0
Okay so one third and were dividing it by what	Two	3.0
What would I split this into	Thirds	3.0
Lisa was	You need to do the same thing that you did on the first one to all of them	3.0
Then there are how many parts	Six	3.0
If we divide one third into two parts we get Whats the answer Matty	One sixth	3.0
This makes sense to you all	Yes	0.0
Zoey were you partner A or B	Partner A	0.0
Zoey when I talk about how the placement of the decimal point will change the language would be I think that the decimal point will move either to the right by however many or to the left so is the decimal point on the four going to move to the right or to the left when you multiply it by 10 square	To the right because you are multiplying you move to the right and when you are dividing you move to the left	4.0
How many place value	Two times	3.0
Tera and Kayla youre not done	Oh yes	0.0
Alve are you partner A or partner B	Partner B	0.0
The rest of you can sit down	I thought that it would be nine	3.0
Okay so the answer is nine	Yes	0.0
Whats going to happen to the decimal	Its going to move	3.0
Its going to move	Its going to move two places to the left	3.0
Wayne are you partnering	Yes	0.0
The decimal place will move	Will move	0.0
Which way	Left	3.0
To the left how many spots	Three	3.0
The answer will be	0805	3.0
805 what	805 thousandths	3.0
Bruce are you partner A or partner B	Parten A	0.0
All right that worked out well too so use a complete sense to tell me what is going to happen with that first factor	I think that the decimal will move five places to the right because since youre multiplying it by five you re	4.0
By 10 to the fifth	Yes youre supposed	0.0
Attaching	Youre attaching five zeros	3.0
What is the answer	The answer is 7900	3.0
Those of you who are standing will you please read the learning intention	I will use	0.0
Go	I will use estimation to solve decimal multiplication problems	0.0
What is estimation	Its you round the factors and the numbers problem to try to find around what your answer will be like close to an answer it will be	3.0
Ready	I will know I am successful when I can solve and explain the strategy used on problems one and two on journal page 219	0.0
Alexander look up here	I started  with addition I added to eight times then I added these two I got 16 so I put the six here to carry the one up there then I added the one	4.0
Mariah you used the same strategy or did you stop in the middle of it	I checked it	0.0
Hudson you want to share your strategy	I used this strategy	0.0
Okay you guys listen up	I did like I know that one block is 12 centimeters tall so I doubled it to see how much two was and got 24 and then I doubled that one more time to get 48 so its how much four blocks is	4.0
I did like I know that one block is 12 centimeters tall so I doubled it to see how much two was and got 24 and then I doubled that one more time to get 48 so its how much four blocks is	Since four times two is eight I just	4.0
Tera why do I have people share their strategies	So that we can see different mathematical thinking	3.0
Okay Finn come on up	I just put one into two different parts	4.0
I just put one into two different parts	I did two times eight	4.0
Oh lets do it this way	Twotenths times eight and then	3.0
Twotenths times eight	16 and then the eight times one and I got eight and then I  8 plus 16 and that equals 96 centimeters	4.0
Annie tell us how would you estimate that problem	I would have done eight plus one	3.0
Eight plus one	Plus two	3.0
EIleen	I would round the 12 down to one and round eight to be eight because thats more simple	4.0
EIleen will you please tell her again	I would round the 12 down to one times eight because thats close to 96	4.0
Can you please repeat that for me	She rounds off eight plus  eight times one and eight times two	1.0
Portia	I rounded eight to 10 and then 12 to one	4.0
Can you repeat that oneKayla	Rounded up eight to ten	3.0
And	And	0.0
Multiplied what	Multiplied 82	3.0
You multiply 10 by what	By one	3.0
Matty	Because you split it up and the estimate is close to it	4.0
How did you estimate	110 times three equals 330 which is near 308	4.0
In the second one how would you estimate that Tera	I did one	0.0
How would you estimate that one	10 times three equals 30	4.0
What did you notice	We already got the answer for 12 times eight which is 96 but for the one right before that where youre multiplying it times eight but then decimals moved over two to the left decimals are left in the answer and when you only have a decimal theres no decimal in the answer	4.0
What do you think Portia	No maam	1.0
Norman tell me about the factors	I was going to say when I noticed that when you go down its just divided by ten to the power of one equals	3.0
Portia what do you think	I also noticed in the answers the decimal point moved one to the right each time	3.0
Okay what else Mariah	I also noticed that in the answers theySShave the same numbers	3.0
What about the questions	In the questions they do too but the decimal is always in a different place value	3.0
Okay because theseSShave different place values right	Yes	0.0
Yes	similar ones that dont have like in 12 times eight and 12 times eight	4.0
similar ones that dont have like in 12 times eight and 12 times eight	In 12 times eight theres a decimal in that one and its not in the eight and the twelve	4.0
Is there a decimal on this one	No	0.0
Where is the decimal go	At the end	3.0
How can you figure out where the decimal goes on any of these	You can estimate	3.0
Clay what does that mean if Im going to multiply these making them into whole numbers	Youre going to estimate them and	3.0
Nope this one multiply	Wait you multiply them	3.0
What am I going to multiply	You are only going to multiply the whole numbers	3.0
Okay so what would that be	Six times two	3.0
Six times two	You are turning it into a whole number	3.0
No so	Wait are you talking about  or estimate  whole numbers	3.0
First youre going to	Estimate	3.0
Second youre going to	Multiply the whole numbers	3.0
Now youre going to	Ignore the decimals	3.0
Yes so youre going to multiply0 what are you going to multiply	Sixpoint	3.0
No youre going to ignore the decimals so this is actually going to be 68 times 21	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	I get it	0.0
Whats the third thing youre going to do Lisa	You place the decimal point	3.0
Got it	Yes	0.0
First step was	My first step was to estimate so I rounded 68 up to seven and then I rounded 21 down to two and I knew seven times two is 14 and then it said to ignore the decimals so I made 68 into 68 and then I made 21 into 21 so it needs to be  as in 428 and then in order to place the decimal I put my estimate and then it was 14 so I knew that was a tenths place so I put the decimal after tenth place	4.0
Wayne are you with us	Yes	0.0
Would it help you to make an estimate with that	No because I think it would be something like zero times zero equals zero and that wont really help you with your problem	4.0
Wayne are you with me	Yes	0.0
Okay are you guys with me	Yes	0.0
Do you want me to do the first one with you	No yes no yes no yes	0.0

Yes Elise	five and the denominator is four	3.0
Can you tell us what youre doing and why	Im just writing it up into a square and then I put the number thats four	4.0
I just wanted you to tell us what youre doing	Im just drawing a square and putting the numbers there  four ones and then onefourth	4.0
Im just drawing a square and putting the numbers there  four ones and then onefourth	One and onefourth	4.0
Left over	No therell be one more whole left over	4.0
No therell be one more whole left over	Since theres four wholes already there is going to be onefourth because four  is a whole	4.0
Since theres four wholes already there is going to be onefourth because four  is a whole	There ll be one and onefourth	4.0
Comment awesome	I agree with your answer but I did it differently on how to figure it out	1.0
You want to tell us	Yes	0.0
Yes	I took the five and put it over  and then I  how many times four goes into five	4.0

I can do it	What I did is I started with the two before the point and so I put a two and I saw there was a four so I put the four there and added to the nine and so it was two and 49 hundredths and then I wrote it out two and 49 hundredths in word form	4.0
Olivia	And is for the decimal	3.0
Evelyn	Because if you wanted a specific number to  decimals then you have to put the two before the four tenths so it is 49 hundredths	4.0

Classidy class	Yesidy yes	0.0
Two and three Charlie	Its like superman	0.0
Okay Charlie	What I did for problem two was I added 6  8 to get 14 and then I had to go to tenths place so I added four and seven and wait I just realized thats	4.0
Wheres your mistake that youre realizing	Now that I realize it because I know 7  3 is like a whole so I forgot an extra yes like a one in the tenths place	4.0
What would the answer be if you put a one in the tenths place	15 and one tenth	3.0
Number three	I started with as if there was a one in the tens place	4.0
I started with as if there was a one in the tens place	I knew that would just be ten	4.0
I knew that would just be ten	The next one I did was I did 7  4 which got me to 11 and then I did zero plus nine which is nine so I did point nine tenths and then I did six plus three hundredths equaled nine hundredths	4.0
The next one I did was I did 7  4 which got me to 11 and then I did zero plus nine which is nine so I did point nine tenths and then I did six plus three hundredths equaled nine hundredths	My answer that I got was twenty one and ninety nine hundredths	4.0
Now looking at this next problem twenty one and thirty seven hundredths is this closer to 21 or 22	Its closer to 21	3.0

Landon can you respond to what Hugh just said	No	0.0
Hugh can you repeat that	Yes	0.0
Yes	We talked about for the algorithm we have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	3.0
So step one multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number	Thats the only step	3.0
Thats the only step	Step two you have your answer	3.0

Otherwise okay	I think five times  is equal	3.0
Cassandra which one do you think was the hardest to answer and why	I think the hardest one to answer was D	3.0
Kennedy	I agree with Cassandra because when all the other ones is like five times five fourths as a large number in spite of  numbers	1.0
Kennedy	Five	3.0
Faye	Five is greater because if you do five times one half its five tenths	4.0
Five is greater because if you do five times one half its five tenths	Five is bigger because its a whole number	4.0
Because if you multiply five by a half it would be five over two	Because five times two is 10	4.0
Why do you say less	Because five is greater than five times 81 so thats Oh its inequivalent	4.0
So 86 over 7 is what Madison	If youre doing five times 86 over seven its only one away from a whole so it will be really close to five but its not	4.0
If youre doing five times 86 over seven its only one away from a whole so it will be really close to five but its not	Its a little bit less than five	4.0
Now look at B Landon what did you put for B	For B I said that five times two and one third was bigger than five	3.0
Jonas	The reason why its bigger because not only are you multiplying it by two which makes it 10 youre also multiplying it by a third which makes it	4.0

Elaine	I think it relates to equivalent fractions because three over three is equal to one and	4.0
Three over three is equal to one	Yes and if you three thirds one is a whole and three over three if you have a pizza and you eat three out of three then you eat the whole pizza for example	4.0
Yes and if you three thirds one is a whole and three over three if you have a pizza and you eat three out of three then you eat the whole pizza for example	Thats equivalent because	4.0
Claire	I think that our thinking was different because I said that the numerator and denominator are the same but therefore you could multiply and add the exact same	4.0
I think that our thinking was different because I said that the numerator and denominator are the same but therefore you could multiply and add the exact same	I think its similar because we both kind of thought of the same thing	4.0
Larry	I would like to add on to both of them because when I think of finding equivalent fractions I know that you have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	1.0
I would like to add on to both of them because when I think of finding equivalent fractions I know that you have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number	So say you have one fourth and you want to find the equivalent fraction you multiply the one by three and then the four by three which is equivalent to one and youll have an equivalent fraction	4.0

One thing I noticed is I saw that on the first problem the whole You were subtracting four from one and that equals three	Then for the top fraction for number two is three	4.0
Then for the top fraction for number two is three	I was subtracting another whole again	4.0
Whitney what was your estimate for number 2	For number 2 I did 32 1	4.0
So 1 was your estimate	Yes	0.0
Sandra	I did 311 2 and I did equals 21 2	4.0
I see Emanual can you say what you wrote for your estimate	I did a little less than 2	3.0
Camella what was you answer for number 1	It was 33 5	3.0
River	Number 2	0.0
Number 2	I stopped working on that because I didn t read it right	0.0
Okay Felix	12 3	3.0
Gordon	That we didn t really have to do that much work	3.0
What step did we not have to do Emmitt	We didn t have to find the common denominator because both have the same denominator	4.0
Astrid	You had to have borrowed from one of the wholes	3.0
Rebecca	31 322 3	3.0
31 321 3 right	11 3	3.0
Francis what do you notice about problem 4	It s	0.0
What do we need to find first	The common denominator	3.0
Go	I think the estimate would be almost 1  10	4.0
I think the estimate would be almost 1  10	Yes	1.0
Yes	Thanks	0.0
Thanks	Because 9  8 is 1	4.0

Edwin so I see your partner is confused how we got to borrow in this problem and they even look a little confused on how to  this one	If you borrow	3.0
Veronica what was the answer for number 3	110	3.0
Gerald can you explain your picture	My picture was I did tenths and I put 910 and then I put a subtraction sign and then I shaded in 810 and then I did the equal sign and then shaded in 110	4.0
Emanual	Either finding the common denominator or having to borrow	3.0
Whitney	What I did was I took 3 4 and I multiply it by 3	3.0
Why	Because the bottom will make 12	4.0
Because the bottom will make 12	I took 1 3 and also multiply it by 4	4.0
What strategy did you use	Multiplication	3.0
Multiplying the	Denominator	3.0
What was your common denominator	It was 12	3.0
You said you multiply this fraction by 3 and then this one by	4	3.0
Were going to try it again	I don t know the answer	0.0

What are your two whole numbers that you see	You have to round up or run down	3.0
He s really trying to explain it to you	Did you add the fractions that you have	0.0
Did you add the fractions that you have	Because Im subtracting	3.0
Because Im subtracting	You got to take away the whole to get 2	4.0
You got to take away the whole to get 2	Im going to add 3	4.0
Im going to add 3	Then you have to  6	4.0
Then you have to  6	Thats what goes in	4.0
Thats what goes in	So 4 x 2 is 8	4.0
So 4 x 2 is 8	3 x 2 is 6	4.0
82 why	Three is 5	4.0
Three is 5	Then 2  1 is 1	4.0
You can just write two	So the estimate is pretty much just that	3.0
Good	3  8	3.0
What times 3 is 6	By 2	3.0
Yes so multiply top and bottom by 2	Im just going to do 6 and 6 and 12	3.0
Im just going to do 6 and 6 and 12	Thats pretty close	0.0

Were showing Nadia active listening you know we expect from each other	What I did was I did 2 x 81 which equals 162 for the numerator and 5 x 1 5 and I figured out how many 5s goes into 162 which is 12 and I had a remainder of 2 so 162 is 12 and 25	4.0
Okay Arthur would you like to add something	I dont want to add but my thinking is similar because I used the same with the way that she got the answer and I did get 1625 but then I didnt know how to convert it so I agree	1.0
Youre stuck on the converting part	Yes	0.0
Cyrus	My thinking was different from it	1.0
My thinking was different from it	I did the exact same thing she did and I got 1625 and then I did 32 x 5 because I want to get a close number to 162 and I got 160	1.0
I did the exact same thing she did and I got 1625 and then I did 32 x 5 because I want to get a close number to 162 and I got 160	I have a remainder of 2 and I got an answer of 32 and 25	4.0
Who can give us a whole step Arthur	You have to divide 162 by 5	3.0
2 x 5 is	10	3.0
3 x 5 is	15	3.0
Plus one	16	3.0
Oh Im making it mad	Oh no	0.0

Did you draw a picture	No I dont like pictures	0.0
Michelle	That we have different denominators	3.0
Calvin how do we find the answer	What I did is I made it I guess since it was 34 and so I made it into 68	3.0
Why did you make it into 68	Because I knew that 34 I couldnt divide that by a 12 because it was odd and odd number	4.0
Okay so we had a half of 34 not 68	No I made it bigger into 68 and then I divided by a 12 or I made that into a half which was 38	4.0
Natasha	since the two denominators are different I had to multiply what times what equals four so two times two and then I multiplied the numerators two times two and then I got 24 and 34 to the same denominator and then I got 54 so I converted it to 1 and 14	4.0
You can just multiply across	Yes	0.0

And 12 is	48	3.0
48	Yes	0.0
Rita explain how you knew	I know that 13  13 is bigger because theyre not the same denominator we have to convert both of those to 6 so 13  26 plus 26	4.0

What did you do first Isaiah	I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	4.0
I took 12 and I put 24 over it and then that was 12 so then I put another 14 next to it since it was being added	So	0.0
We did cross off the 12	Thats what I was going to say	1.0
Julian say it again	I already knew 12 was 24 and 24 is equals 12 and then I knew 24 was	4.0
The next step is 24 plus 14 equals what was our answer	34	3.0
Green	I think its light green	3.0
I think its light green	Wait I think its the purple right	1.0
Wait I think its the purple right	Okay purple it is	1.0
All right does that make sense now	Yes	0.0
Skyler does that makes sense	Yes	0.0
Dont say yes if you dont If youre lying to me dont lie and say yes	I get it	0.0
Ari can you explain how you got your answer to this one	Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	0.0
Im not a 100 now but I know how to get the answer	What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	4.0
What I did was I got a light green and I put it on a 15 and theres three light greens would go on 15 so I knew that 110 wouldnt be enough for a 15	Then thats as far as I got	0.0
Okay then the light green might not be the right one	Its purple	3.0
Did that work with purple	Yes	0.0
Blake can you explain your thinking for this one please	I know 12 is 48 and then I did four plus three is seven so I got 78	4.0
Say that again	I knew 12 is 48 so I did 48 plus 38 and I got 78	4.0
You see the difference there	Yes	0.0
Drew why do we estimate	We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct	4.0
Have you been using them	Yes	0.0
Josh do you have your answer	Yes	0.0
I like seeing youre thinking	I dont get it	2.0
How is this problem different from other problems we did	Because 13 and then 12	4.0
Isaiah	Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	4.0
Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that	4.0
What do you think about that Theo	I think that you just have to find a way that both  another fraction that fits into both of them	3.0
Can you say that again a little louder	You have to find a fraction thats fits evenly in a 12	3.0
Ava can you repeat what she said	You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13	1.0
Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Adam share your thinking for me please	Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then	3.0
Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange	Yes	0.0
Okay	Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	4.0
Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	Then I used the purple pieces to see that it would be like 612 on each side so then I would take away the two that I used to find that and then it would be 1012 but then you can also convert that to 56	4.0
You said you used the 14	I just used those to find out Because then I could put the purple pieces over them to see like Because it was a perfect match if I put that and there was room left for the purple	4.0
So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012	Yes	0.0
Piper	So I learned this strategy at my old school	0.0
So I learned this strategy at my old school	You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	4.0
You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	You can multiply them both by each other	4.0
You can multiply them both by each other	So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it	0.0
You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right	I know	0.0
The first thing I heard you say was that you know you could multiply the denominators	Yes	0.0
Then youd have to figure out 12 is how many 16	Three	3.0
13 is how many 16	Two	3.0
Then you had 36 plus 26 equals	56	3.0
Theo	I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	4.0
I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56	4.0
Were going to do	Do I got to press something  because I have no  for this	0.0
I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think	Yes	0.0
Okay so just do the top one right now 13 plus 14	Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again	2.0
Were going to learn that in another lesson	No I mean like the one that weve been doing	0.0
Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112	412	3.0
Does that make more sense	Yes	0.0
I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make	A lot	0.0
A lot	A lot of more sense	0.0
Adam	What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	4.0
What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	Then that would be 412	4.0
Then that would be 412	Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	4.0
Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	and got 712	4.0
Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to	Not try	0.0
So tell us what youre confused about	I dont know how to add	2.0
Let me see if I can  No for the whole class to hear	Okay	0.0
Okay	Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	4.0
Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	4.0
13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	Then you know that	0.0
Lydia	You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can	4.0
Lydia the 13 and the 14 are what colors	Orange and yellow	3.0
The 112 is which color	Light green	3.0
What does she need to do with 112 Lydia	Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	4.0
Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	That would be 412	4.0
Lydia continue	Then on the 14 do the same thing	0.0
Then on the 14 do the same thing	Which would be 312 and then 312 plus 412 is 712	4.0
Skyler does that make more sense	Yes	0.0
Which math tool	Fraction	3.0
So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer	No we dont	0.0
No we dont	Why is it always doing this	0.0
Which one of those things will make you more successful	Adding	3.0

Is this one feeling easier than the last one	Yes	0.0
Ari  can you share your thinking	Okay	0.0
Okay	Since Josh  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	0.0
Since Josh  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	That one worked and those are 15	3.0
And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they	No	0.0
Theo	I got	0.0
Respond to what Ari was saying	I think that he would  but but he had to convert into 110 because	1.0
To convert to 110 because he	Yes because	0.0
Ari and what do we think about that	I agree with Theo because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410	1.0
What I want you to do open to page 95 in your Math Journal	Should we	0.0

Can you rephrase your question	Right	0.0
Right	Like the three fourths and seven eighths theyre the same thing	3.0
Bella I know your little brain wants to add these two together what do you get if you add those two together	Normally we will get 13 eighths but we actually cannot add them because we dont know the two distances	4.0

Explain your thinking	Part A I did 12 is 25	4.0
Part A I did 12 is 25	I did that 2x510 and 410  equals to 12 and 45 is 9 so thats 910	4.0
Sawyer what do you think about Riley got 910 what do you think about that	I was putting away my	0.0
What do you think about that	I agree with her	1.0
I agree with her	First I did 2x5 it was 10 and then I knew that 12 of a 10 was 510 and then 25t of 10 would be 410 so I did 5410 would be 910 of your candy bar	4.0
Blake	but that didnt work out so then I used my fraction circle and I used my circles to  and I figured out that five of them	4.0
Dylan	I have a question because I thought we were only supposed to solve A B and C but I dont get how they got 910 when its 15	2.0
Can someone answer that JD	In order to add the fractions you have to give them the same denominators so thats why we multiplied and then found the 910	4.0
What were the two fractions we were adding	12 and 25	3.0
They made them 110 so they have a common denominator	Okay	0.0
Does that make sense now	Yes	0.0
Dylan I liked that you asked that question thank you very much	Youre welcome	0.0
Then part B Henly	I drew a chocolate bar and I split it into 110 because I knew  110 equally and then I knew I have 12 could go into 110 overall	4.0

Molly	For C	0.0
For C	My answer is  explaining	0.0
Thats perfect thats fine	I wrote Nick should give 4 and 12 to himself and 4 and 12 to Tasha because there are 910 of the bar so you divide them equally among 2 people	4.0
I wrote Nick should give 4 and 12 to himself and 4 and 12 to Tasha because there are 910 of the bar so you divide them equally among 2 people	2 94 12 so Nick and Tasha will get 4 12 of the chocolate	4.0
How many times is that	Four and one	3.0
12 equals how many tenths	Five	3.0

Allie	Hi	0.0
Hi	Okay so  I think its 12 inches because first of all in this video it says they get to 12 inches and then second of all they look 12 inches because they look like the size of a ruler	4.0
Is there any information from your graph that can help you think that	Yes because at the very end it shows 12 inches so when theyre 20 months they are 12 inches	4.0
Okay Sean what do you think about what Allie said	I agree with her that it said that they grow up to 12 inches because like what Allie said it even says it in the video and on the graph it only goes up to 12 inches and then it goes in a straight line	1.0
Joel whats your thought	I disagree with them	1.0
I disagree with them	I think when they get older they might go to 15 inches	3.0
Do you have any data to back that up	No	0.0

Let s go	Okay so first I just put my thing into I think into 13 going up	4.0
Okay so first I just put my thing into I think into 13 going up	Then after I made it into 14 sideways and then I labeled them	4.0
Then after I made it into 14 sideways and then I labeled them	Then I shaded six of the 112 in because if you multiply three times two that will be six	4.0
Then I shaded six of the 112 in because if you multiply three times two that will be six	Then four times three that would be 12	4.0
All right number two	What I did is at the Y axis I think it is I did 13 and I divided it by 14	4.0
What I did is at the Y axis I think it is I did 13 and I divided it by 14	Then I went up the X axis I think it is	4.0

I don t know	I labelled it 13 and 23 and then I made squares	4.0
I labelled it 13 and 23 and then I made squares	Then I colored the 23	4.0

Can I hear what you wrote for number one Emery	Multiply the numerator and the denominator to get the answer your shading	3.0
When you said multiply the numerators and denominators it starts to sound like numerator times denominator and thats not what you mean is it	Oh yes	0.0
See how if you word like first do this then do this that would be helpful	Okay	0.0
Henry what did you put	I  multiply the denominator with the other denominator then you could just multiply the numerator with the other numerator	3.0
Okay so lets do numerator times numerator denominator times denominator	Okay	0.0
Zoe what did you write	Mine is the algorithm for multiplying fractions as numerator times numerator equals numerator and denominator times denominator	3.0
Awesome Laura	The first step is to multiply the two numerators by each other and then do the same for the dominator	3.0
But you dont have to change it but thats Ava	First you multiply the two numerators and the two denominators and into products to make them a fraction	3.0
Read that again	First you multiply the two numerators and then the two denominators and then you use the products to make them into a fraction	3.0

Did that work with purple	Yes	0.0
Hunter can you explain your thinking for this one please	I know 12 is 48 and then I did four plus three is seven so I got 78	4.0
Say that again	I knew 12 is 48 so I did 48 plus 38 and I got 78	4.0
You see the difference there	Yes	0.0
Sean why do we estimate	We estimate so when we do get our answer we can see if its really correct	4.0
Have you been using them	Yes	0.0
Mark do you have your answer	Yes	0.0
I like seeing youre thinking	I dont get it	2.0
How is this problem different from other problems we did	Because 13 and then 12	4.0
Ari	Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	4.0
Because 12 Because the denominator is  is odd	So when you trying doing 12 its going to be one and a half of that	4.0
What do you think about that Matthew	I think that you just have to find a way that both  another fraction that fits into both of them	3.0
Can you say that again a little louder	You have to find a fraction thats fits evenly in a 12	3.0
Laura can you repeat what she said	You have to find a fraction that evenly fit both 12 and 13	1.0
Okay I know not everybody might be totally finished but can I have Morgan share your thinking for me please	Okay so I laid out the pink piece and the orange piece and then	3.0
Because thats a 12 and a 13 pink and orange	Yes	0.0
Okay	Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	4.0
Then I put a 14 over it then I tried to see how much that would be	Then I used the purple pieces to see that it would be like 612 on each side so then I would take away the two that I used to find that and then it would be 1012 but then you can also convert that to 56	4.0
You said you used the 14	I just used those to find out Because then I could put the purple pieces over them to see like Because it was a perfect match if I put that and there was room left for the purple	4.0
So you did 112 plus 112 and you got 1012	Yes	0.0
Hannah	So I learned this strategy at my old school	0.0
So I learned this strategy at my old school	You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	4.0
You would find one that if it was a small enough number you can multiply them both	You can multiply them both by each other	4.0
You can multiply them both by each other	So 12 I did I dont know how to describe it	0.0
You know how I feel about being able to describe what you did though right	I know	0.0
The first thing I heard you say was that you know you could multiply the denominators	Yes	0.0
Then youd have to figure out 12 is how many 16	Three	3.0
13 is how many 16	Two	3.0
Then you had 36 plus 26 equals	56	3.0
Matthew	I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	4.0
I started off with trying to find out which fractions can go in 13 and I got 16	Then I  36 plus 26 equals 56	4.0
Were going to do	Do I got to press something  because I have no  for this	0.0
I think it would be good for us to do a couple more of this what do you guys think	Yes	0.0
Okay so just do the top one right now 13 plus 14	Ms  how do you do the strategy of it again	2.0
Were going to learn that in another lesson	No I mean like the one that weve been doing	0.0
Okay so that looks like its going to be how many 112	412	3.0
Does that make more sense	Yes	0.0
I went over and helped these gentlemen  use our fraction circle pieces and once you really set the pieces out how much sense did it make	A lot	0.0
A lot	A lot of more sense	0.0
Morgan	What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	4.0
What I did was I first multiplied three and four which is 12 and then I did three times 13 times four equals 112	Then that would be 412	4.0
Then that would be 412	Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	4.0
Then I did the same thing on the other side so that would be four times three equals 312	and got 712	4.0
Remember how I said it is always okay to not know but its not okay to	Not try	0.0
So tell us what youre confused about	I dont know how to add	2.0
Let me see if I can  No for the whole class to hear	Okay	0.0
Okay	Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	4.0
Basically you have to find what so what the denominators what would that go into to make both fractions even	13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	4.0
13 plus 14 we know that three can go into 12 four times so	Then you know that	0.0
Ava	You take 13 and 14 and a few of your 112 and see how many 112 can go into a 13 how many 112 can	4.0
Ava the 13 and the 14 are what colors	Orange and yellow	3.0
The 112 is which color	Light green	3.0
What does she need to do with 112 Ava	Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	4.0
Take some of your 112 and see how many 112 can go onto a 13	That would be 412	4.0
Ava continue	Then on the 14 do the same thing	0.0
Then on the 14 do the same thing	Which would be 312 and then 312 plus 412 is 712	4.0
Haley does that make more sense	Yes	0.0
Which math tool	Fraction	3.0
So from the talking I hear Im assuming that we have our answer	No we dont	0.0
No we dont	Why is it always doing this	0.0
Which one of those things will make you more successful	Adding	3.0
Adding fractions or knowing where the iPad is pointing	Adding fractions	3.0
Is this one feeling easier than the last one	Yes	0.0
Avery  can you share your thinking	Okay	0.0
Okay	Since Mark  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	0.0
Since Mark  some pieces I couldnt exactly for all of them but the closest that I got to it was this	That one worked and those are 15	3.0
And 12 dont fit because 15 dont fit into a 12 do they	No	0.0
Matthew	I got	0.0
Respond to what Avery was saying	I think that he would  but but he had to convert into 110 because	1.0
To convert to 110 because he	Yes because	0.0
Avery and what do we think about that	I agree with Matthew because 12 equals 510 and then you add the 410	1.0
What I want you to do open to page 95 in your Math Journal	Should we	0.0
Alreya	To find equivalent fractions	3.0
Good to find equivalent fractions thats exactly what we did in yesterdays lesson right	Yes	0.0
Vianay what is an equivalent fraction	An equivalent fraction is we looked at so if one fraction can be equal to another fraction	3.0
Delilah	The same amount I think	3.0
Okay so think back to our pizza demonstration from yesterday Mr Jonathan if I eat one half of a pizza that is cut into four slices how many slices do I have to eat to eat half of the pizza	Um two	3.0
Two what	Two pieces of pizza	3.0
Why was it two	Because if you eat three then youre going to have one piece left over	4.0
Have you eaten half	No	0.0
If its only cut into two slices how many of you have to eat	One	3.0
What was the answer for the missing denominator on number one Damian	12	3.0
12 how did you figure that out	Because on the top I on the top I multiplied six	3.0
Multiplied by	Multiplied by six	4.0
Multiplied by six	Because one times six is six	4.0
Good and then	And then I multiply	3.0
Multiplied	Multiplied two times six and I got 12	4.0
Why did you also do it on the bottom	Because whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top	4.0
Whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom	Yes	0.0
Monique what is our missing denominator in number two	12	3.0
Missing denominator for number three Isaiah	Six	3.0
Missing for four Tati	12	3.0
Good missing for five Emiliano	Two	3.0
Two were we missing a denominator on number five	No	0.0
No now they changed it up instead of missing our denominator theyre missing their	Numerator	3.0
All right number six our missing numerator Kim was	Ten	3.0
So you did it right so what does that equal	Ten	3.0
This one that you have written two times two	Is four	3.0
So Kim you did it absolutely perfectly you just wrote down 10 so we had to multiply by two so then on number seven Deneli whats our missing denominator	Twelve	3.0
Valentina missing denominator on eight	Sixteen	3.0
Five times what	Ten	3.0
Five times what equals 10	Two	3.0
Yep whatever you do to the top	You do to the bottom	3.0
So what is six times two	Twelve	3.0
12 All right number nine Abner what is our missing denominator	Three	3.0
And finally number 10 Delilah	Is it 6	3.0
So those we had to use what	Division	3.0
Can you still use multiplication	Yes	0.0
What is the first factor pair we all should know	One and 56	3.0
But if we multiply two times what Gaby	28	3.0
Is there anything we can multiply by three	No	0.0
How about four	Yes	0.0
What is it	Four times 14	3.0
What do you have to do to get from two to four	Times it by two	3.0
Well watch this cool thing	Divide by 2	3.0
Is that it	No	0.0
Now theres the one that you all better know because you wrote it 100 times	Seven times eight equals 56	4.0
Those are all of the factor pairs for the number 56	What about this one Mr C	2.0
What about this one	Eleven	3.0
Yes sir	Could you have 48	3.0
Miss Jessica please give me one factor pair for the number 30	3 and 5 oh wait no 3 and wait no 6 and 5	3.0
So what would our first factor be	One and thirty	3.0
Are there any that we missed	Yes	0.0
So what is one of the missing ones Leslie	Three and ten	3.0
And our final missing one Miss Kim	Two and fifteen	3.0
What does composite mean	Composite means that it has more than one factor more than two factors	3.0
So a composite number is any number that has more than	Two factors	3.0
Two factors ok What is it called when it only has two factors	Prime	3.0
Well did we just prove that 30 has a plethora more than two	Yes	0.0
Hang on Areya has a question	When you have to square anything on this side like right there on this side	3.0
On the left side	Yeah you have to divide	3.0
Thank you maam	That was an easy homework	0.0
Gaby take a guess	The decimal point	3.0
The answer should be zero and five	Tenths	3.0
Decimals must be in take a look at the names of them	With the TH at the end	3.0
Thats the name yes but look at the numbers the numerical system	They go back	3.0
They go back	Theyre a part of the other numbers	3.0
Whats the first one	Tenths	3.0
Whats the second one	Hundreths	3.0
What would the next one be	Thousandths	3.0
Alex	Onetenth	3.0
Ishmail what does one 10th mean	One tenth is like how many slices of your pizza	3.0
Mr Brody	Its like one out of like that number	3.0
Can you give me an example be more specific	Like if you have ten candy bars	3.0
Okay so were going youre doing parts of a set thats fine no you can do it that way	You ate one candy bar and then you have nine more	4.0
So if you didnt hear what Mr Brody said he said that you have 10 candy bars remember like that piggy guy what was his name in the video we saw	Bill	0.0
But remember fractions are not just parts of wholes they are also parts of	Sets	3.0
Raise your hand what is a set Emiliano	A lot of like a whole	3.0
Theres one word that means the exact same thing	Group	3.0
Isaiah	I have another example	0.0
Of	Of the exact problem like onetenth	3.0
Okay lets hear it	So like you know how like we do the multiplication quizzes I just pretended that theyre instead of  fifty multipication questions that theres only ten	4.0
So like you know how like we do the multiplication quizzes I just pretended that theyre instead of  fifty multipication questions that theres only ten	And youre doing it you could do it in three minutes and when the three minutes are up you only got one out of the ten	4.0
So thats an awesome example did you just tell me parts of a whole or parts of a set	Set	3.0
But is that our whole group	No	0.0
So we have how many wholes	Zero	3.0
But Ive taught it already Jessica	And	3.0
That makes sense because what place value on our place value chart is the one in	Ones	3.0
Ones	Tens	3.0
How many wholes do we have	Zero ten	3.0
You forgot our decimal point	Zero and three ten	3.0
Kim	Ten	3.0
You just said it what would our denominator	Ten	3.0
So our denominator is going to be 10 because its broken into 10 pieces and what would our numerator be	Three	3.0
Yes sir	So each time you have like 05 or 02 does the zero	0.0
Zero and	zero and three does the zero	0.0
And I think its going to answer the question youre asking but go ahead	And does the zero turn into a ten	3.0
And if we have three parts out of 10 of a piece of pizza do we have a whole pizza	No	0.0
How would you say that decimal Alex	One and three tenths	3.0
One and	Im telling you that the camera isnt recording	0.0
What	It isnt recording right now	0.0
You just said it how	One and three tenths	3.0
So how many wholes do we have Brody	One	3.0
And then is that decimal still gonna look the exact same way as the decimal up here	No	0.0
Deneli question	So if its like zero dot like zero dot	3.0
Zero	And three but	3.0
And three what	Threetenths	3.0
Good always say it right	But what happens if its hundredths	2.0
Isaiah	So like if the decimal when its like two or one lets just say that was	3.0
Are you asking about this one	Yeah	0.0
May I see it please	Yes	0.0
You do huh	Check it out	0.0
Isnt it the same thing	Yes	0.0
Yes because does it matter how many zeros we have to the left of the decimal	No	0.0
And zeros are worth what	Zero nothing	3.0
But what are zeros	Placeholders	3.0
What is that number Valentina	Four	3.0
Its four yes its four now is that the way that you write the number four	No	0.0
But the thing is when you have the number four wholes are there any parts	No	0.0
So we all know that thats the number four right	Yep	0.0
Who can tell me what that number is Mr Jonathan	Its still 4	3.0
What place value is that zero in	Tenths	3.0
One to the left of the decimal	Ones	3.0
And what place value is the four in	Tens	3.0
So what is the answer	40	3.0
So look at that doesnt that look similar to what we just did just in reverse	Yeah	0.0
Whats the first one word Leslie	Four	3.0
It cant be four still cant it	Because the zeros dont count	4.0
They dont count because theyre not placeholders right	Yeah it doesnt matter	3.0
Now whats it worth Vianay	Four	3.0
Did you put your hand down unless your name is Vianay Vianay hows it still four	Its because its behind the decimal point	4.0
And so does it matter how many we add	No	0.0
Okay well if were all so sure of this that the zeros dont matter then this must still be four	No	0.0
I have the exact same number of zeros here that I have here correct	Yeah	0.0
But yet youre telling me that that ones not worth four	Its not four because theres too much zeros where the four is	4.0
So hang on hang on Deneli let me stop you for just a sec does it matter more about the number of zeros or where the decimal is	Decimal	3.0
Does that zero matter	Yes	0.0
So we all agree thats four right	Yes	1.0
If I add a zero here is it still four	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
If I had a zero here is it still four	Yes	0.0
How do we say that one	Zero and four hundredths	3.0
Which is written like that	Yes	0.0
Tati	Zero point four hundredths	3.0
Did you just say point	Zero and four hundredths	3.0
What is it Tati	Forty	3.0
Its not hundredths anymore its the next one over say it	Thousandths	3.0
Turn to your tables and tell your table mates if you think thats true or not	Its true	3.0
And why you think its true	I want to guess	0.0
Who havent I heard from Emiliano what do you think	I multiplied by ten to the 4 and then multiplied ten by the hundred	4.0
What is 100 times 10	100000	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
So what is four times 10	Forty	3.0
I said are they the same	No	0.0
We talked about this yesterday but they are	Equivalent	3.0
Jessica what do you think	I think that theyre not the same because of the amount of each number	4.0
Alreya	Because the numerator has an extra or has a zero and thats 40	4.0
Are our denominators	No	0.0
Is 1000 the same as 100	No	0.0
Tati what do you think	That theres more pieces	3.0
The one in the box how many total slices would there be	1000	3.0
And how many of those pieces Damian do we want to eat	40	3.0
We want to eat 40	Thousand	3.0
40 what what are we eating	40 slices	3.0
Of pizza right	Yeah	0.0
So we want to eat 40 slices of pizza out of	1000	3.0
Leslie	Four slices	3.0
Anybody want to do it	No	0.0
Miss Gaby what do you think	So its like theyre equivalent because like if you multiply four by 10 you get 40 and if you multiply 100 by 10 you get 1000	4.0
So lets go back to this one four tenths and four hundredths	Theyre not equivalent	3.0
But what about four tenths and 40 hundredths	Yes	0.0
So Mr Alex in the number 40 hundredths how many total pieces of pizza are there	There are 100 pieces of pizza in there	3.0
How many are we eating	40	3.0
Mr Ishmail in the one on the left four tenths how many total pieces of pizza do we have	Forty	3.0
How many total pieces of pizza do we have Ishmail	Six	3.0
Oy yi yi Deneli how many total pieces of pizza do we have in that one	Four	3.0
Four	10	1.0
Kim	10	3.0
Alex	How many slices of pizza	3.0
We have 10 slices of pizza total and Mr Ishmail how many do we want to eat	Four	3.0
So those are the same right	No	0.0
No but they are	Equivalent	3.0
We keep coming back to that word equivalent because thats whats important understanding that they are an equal	Amount	3.0
And this is the question that I asked over here here how many slices are we eating	Four	3.0
How many here	Forty	3.0
Are those equal	No	0.0
Theyre not equal when were dealing with whole numbers right	No	0.0
But when were dealing with fractions they can be because what matters is the size of the	People	3.0
Its a regular sized slice right because most pizzas are cut anywhere from six slices to 10 slices	But the slices are smaller	3.0
But the slices are smaller	You do to the top	3.0
Comes from because if we change the total number of slices of pizza that we have were also changing the number we have to	Eat	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Ms Deneli question	Whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom so 10 times 10 equals 100 and 10 times 4 equals 40	4.0
So as soon as you get your paper first and last name please and todays date	We may begin	0.0
So lets see if you can figure them out	So its kind of like were teachers	0.0
All right you two ladies you can go ahead and solve these and prove to me that you know what youre doing and then I can make you coaches to help my Ss	Ok	0.0
Yes sir	Will you help me	2.0
Try again	Will you please help me	2.0
So how do you say this fraction	Eight times ten	3.0
Its a fraction eight out of	eight out of 10	3.0
So think about pizzas if we have if it needs 10 slices to make one whole pizza and we have eight of them do we have a whole pizza	Uhuh	0.0
So its zero whole pizzas and	10 eight	3.0
You are not done	I dont know how to convert with 3s	2.0
But as for the other ones theyre a little bit trickier	Yes	0.0
Yes	Im done	0.0
Im not so sure you know decimals to fractions even though you guys should really pay attention because this is the exact same thing you wrote over here	Oh yeah	0.0
Now how do we write that as a decimal Miss Leslie	Zero and eight	3.0
Zero and eight what place value as it in	Eight tenths	3.0
All right so the first one was pretty easy right	Yes	0.0
Now many of you got this right because you know that that is equivalent to onehalf because whatever you do to the top	You must do to the bottom	3.0
It is equal to	Zero and fivetenths	3.0
Why do you think this is equal to this	Because you need ten tenths to make one whole and five is half of ten	4.0
Miss Kim what is that fraction	Twofourths	3.0
Twofourths two out of	Four	3.0
The answer is	None zero	3.0
What do you need four of to make 1 Alreya	Four quarters	3.0
Four quarters so four times	25	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
What is two times 25	50	3.0
Is this fraction the same thing as this decimal	No	0.0
Its not the same but it is	Equivalent	3.0
What can I divide by both 50 and 100	Two	3.0
What about this one	Yep	0.0
What about this one	Yep	0.0
What about this one	Yes	0.0
What about this one	Yes	0.0
Any one of those would work right	Five	3.0
Wow I have other people named Ishmail in this class	Five	3.0
10 divided by 10 class	Ten one	3.0
One so 100 divided by 10	One ten	3.0
One hundred divided by 10	10	3.0
So now ladies and gentlemen is that true	Yes	0.0
Answer to number four is class zero and	Five tenths	3.0
Number 5 is zero	And six tenths	3.0
Its zero and six	Tenths	3.0
Number six is zero	And seven tenths	3.0
Number nine is the same as number five it is	Zero and six tenths	3.0
Like two thirds	I dont know	0.0
So Isaiah if I were to do that how many twos are there how many threes are there in the number two	None	3.0
So what would be here	Zero	3.0
Look 20 minus 18 leaves me with	Two	3.0
Same process just a different number	Oh because six divided by 2 is 3 and then its not	4.0
How many times does three go into one	Zero	3.0
And these are all	Zeros	3.0
How many times does three go into 10	Three	3.0
Whats three times three	Nine	3.0
Leaving us with	One	3.0
How many times does three go into 10	Three	3.0
Three	Thats cool	0.0
So this one will keep going on and on and on forever just like the other one except this one is now 33 instead of 66	Nobody got that part right	1.0
Whoops	I got it	0.0
Deneli	Four of	0.0
What	Quarters	3.0
Quarters	25	1.0
25	25 hundredths	1.0
25 hundredths	Is zero point 25 hundredths	1.0
Is zero point 25 hundredths	Thats cool	0.0
The cool way to think about this is does anybody know how you write the amount for a quarter	No	0.0
Its what	The whole dollar is actually kind of	0.0
Is it what	Its split into parts	3.0
Alreya	So you just technically imagine the four like a quarter	3.0
Exactly because you need four quarters to make 1 and you only have how many of them	One	3.0
One minute	Done	0.0
Done	Done	0.0
Done	Done	0.0
This one is called greater than	Less than equal to	3.0
Miss Laurie	Because theres not a common denominator	4.0
What does that mean	The sizes arent the pieces arent the same size	3.0
George	Try to find a common denominator	3.0
Whats the cheat you can always use that Mr Parker work Marie	Multiply 6 times 9	3.0
Perfect well not six times nine were doing denominators multiply	8 times 12	3.0
But remember you must not only do the denominator because whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
Mr Josh	96	3.0
And how did we get to 96 on the left side of the equation and however we did it on the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
Okay so Mr Julian has the right answer	The cameras not recording	0.0
Max	12	3.0
This is what your paper should look like whatever we do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
So if we multiply the bottom by 12 we have to multiply	The top	3.0
Marie I know youve been working on your twelves what is six times 12	76	3.0
Robin	72	3.0
Now we must go to the other side and Alreya when we got 96 on this side what do we have to multiply times 12 to equal 96	Eight	3.0
Eight so whatever we do to the bottom	You must do to the top	3.0
Have you noticed that I keep saying that over and over again	Yes	0.0
Do you think thats gonna be a big part of fourth grade	Yes	0.0
So do you think theyre mildly important	Yes	0.0
Find a	Common denominator	3.0
And whatever you	Do to the top you must do to the bottom	3.0
What did she say	Um	0.0
Michelle	Because the denominators are not equal	4.0
What did she say why we could not compare them originally Noah	Cuz the pieces are not the same size	4.0
So Mr Max why do we find a common denominator	Becuase you want to know what the warm up was about	4.0
Ay yay yay Hunter why do we want to find a common denominator	So we could um	0.0
Alreya	Because the pieces are not the same size	4.0
You cant order them you cant add them or you cannot subtract them unless they are the	Same size	3.0
Truman	Onehalf	3.0
And that fraction is written like this correct	Yes	0.0
Jack what is it now	Twofourths	3.0
Why is it twofourths Savannah	Is it twofourths because we multiplied the top number by two and the bottom number by two	4.0
Are we changing just this part	No	0.0
Are we changing just the part that we did eat	No	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Isabelle	Because thats what we multiplied to get 96	4.0
You went over one too many fingers start and count over eight not nine	Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneight	0.0
Mm hmm	72	3.0
So now ladies and gentlemen is it clear to see what the answer should have been	Yes	0.0
So guess what were going to do today	Find the common denominator	3.0
Well just turn it off	Cant you just get a different computer until its working	0.0
Is everybody listening to my directions	Yeah	0.0
Noah	Can you use scratch paper	0.0
Why is it that for number one you can find the answer even without finding a common denominator Marie	Because it has a little bit of work	4.0
Hernan	Theres the same number of pieces	4.0
So it has a common	Numerator	3.0
We could multiply them both together and get what	Eight	3.0
Eight or is two a multiple of four	Yes	0.0
Now do you see that twofourths is bigger than one fourth	Yeah	0.0
How many are you going to do	Five	0.0
List your	Factors multiples	3.0
Whats three times 8	24	3.0
24	Can I please go to the bathroom	0.0
So number two Mr Jack what two fractions are we trying to compare on number two	Onehalf and oneninth	3.0
Onehalf and oneninth	Onehalf and oneninth	1.0
Onehalf and what	Oneninth	3.0
What two fractions are we comparing	Threeeighths and twothirds	3.0
So if I multiply three times eight Isabelle what Mr Parker I get	24	3.0
Tell him I already know	Because three times eight equals 24	4.0
Mr George is a world renowned teacher at Harvard University and he has been kind enough to come back today and teach us simple things like finding common denominators	So basically we multiply those two together eight times three and then you get 24	4.0
Pick somebody to help you out	Robin	0.0
Ok Miss Robin teach	So how we get 24 is we times	3.0
Did you just say we times	No we multiply	3.0
I was getting a little nervous there	You multiply eight times three to equal 24	4.0
You multiply eight times three to equal 24	So what you do was	0.0
Alright lets see if Robin can explain it	So why we do it is eight times three equals 24 because we multiply	4.0
Not to mention youre wearing a hat in my class which doesnt make me happy	When you multiply the two numbers	3.0
Dont talk to the board the board doesnt care	You multiply eight times three because when you multiply if youre like trying to figure out which faction is bigger you have to multiply the denominators and youre always going to get your answer	4.0
Youre saying the same thing Robin said who said the same thing George said	Because you can always multiply	4.0
Miss Polly please tell our class why multiplying eight times three gives us our common denominator	Multiplying eight times three gives you your common denominator because 24 is a multiple of both the numbers	4.0
Ladies and gentlemen remember me teaching you factors and multiples and saying how important theyre going to be	Yes	0.0
You can go help your team real quick and then you can come back and finish the problem	Yes	0.0
The answer is	Nothing	3.0
Whats three times 5	15	3.0
Whats three times 6	18	3.0
Please tell us how you knew 48 would work	48 would work because three can be 48 is a multiple of both 8 and 3	4.0
What can we multiply 24 by to equal 48	Two	3.0
Two	Thats my short cut	3.0
24 times two is	48	3.0
How did we get to where were at so far	Ok so you multiply	3.0
The board doesnt care	Ok so to get to 24 we multiply 8 times 3 and we get 3 and 2 and then we multiply by 3	4.0
Ok so to get to 24 we multiply 8 times 3 and we get 3 and 2 and then we multiply by 3	To get to 24 on this side we multiply by eight and we have to do that to the top and 2 times 8 is 16	4.0
Youre not done	Sixteens bigger than nine	3.0
Sixteens bigger than nine	Yes	0.0
Alreya please tell me which two fractions we are comparing in number 3	Foureighths and seventwelfths	3.0
We just did one just like this	96	3.0
Is seven more than half or less than half of 12	More	3.0
What am I missing	A numerator	3.0
And we know that whatever happens to the bottom has to happen to the	Top	3.0
So Mr Hunter what did I multiply by eight to get 96	12	3.0
So what am I gonna multiply four by	12	3.0
And when I do what do I get	48	3.0
Evan whats missing on this side	Your numerator	3.0
So how did I get from 12 to 96	Times eight	3.0
So what am I gonna have to multiply seven by	Eight	3.0
Jack	56	3.0
So which one is bigger	56	3.0
Miss Laurie huh	Thats how I did it	3.0
Oh I thought you did it with a	No I did different ones on 4 5 and 6	3.0
Mr Abner what two fractions are we comparing on number four	Twothirds	3.0
Twothirds and	Eleventwelfths	3.0
No wonder Jesus beat you huh	36	3.0
Multiplied by	12	3.0
So what should I multiply two by	12	3.0
And what is 12 times two	24	3.0
Miss Jessica what do I multiply 12 by to equal 36	Three	3.0
So what must I multiply 11 by	Three	3.0
And if I multiply 11 times three what do I get	33	3.0
So the first thing I did was see if I could multiply anything by three to get to twelve	And	0.0
Did everybody hear what she said	Yes	0.0
What did she say Truman	She said she was going to multiply three times twelve	3.0
And thats okay because it was a little quiet please repeat what you said	So the first thing I did was see if I could multiply anything by three to get to twelve	3.0
Mr Max	Because its a denominator of twelve	4.0
The answer is could we do my way	Yes	0.0
Does Lauries way work too	Yes	0.0
Why	Because I dont have to cut it into as many pieces as you are	4.0
So what are you trying to accomplish by multiplying three times four	By getting a smaller by cutting it into by cutting it into more than three pieces but less than 36	3.0
Go ahead and write out what you did Laurie so she can see it	So I figured out that three times four equals twelve	4.0
Julian	Lauries way is gonna work because three times four is 12 and 12 is the common and 12 is the common denominator that we need	4.0
Does it matter what your common denominator is as long as your two numbers are multiples of it	No	0.0
Multiples of	12	3.0
Because is three a factor of 12	Yes	0.0
Three times what	Four	3.0
Whats so great about her way versus my way Josh whats so great about her way versus my way	Because it gives you more pieces	4.0
Uhhuh	Shes reducing the fraction	1.0
Who did more work	You	0.0
Noah	Because we always have to try to find a less denominator	4.0
How many multiplication facts did I have to do	Four	3.0
How many did she have to do	Two	3.0
Mr Parker this work every time	Yes	0.0
What could we multiply two by to equal four	Times two	0.0
Now whatever we do to the top	We do to the bottom	3.0
Whatever we do to the bottom	We must do to the top	3.0
Whatever we do to the bottom	We must do to the top	3.0
So what do we get	You would get twofourths	3.0
Who do you think up there Truman you Mr Parker work the best with and listen to	I dont know	0.0
Pick	Its hard to make decisions	0.0
I have to get through the rest of class you have 3 seconds to do this	Noah	0.0
Wheres your sheet Truman	You didnt give me one	0.0
Coaches come pair up	Are we working on this side or this side	0.0
How many rhombuses does it take to make onehole hexagon	Three	3.0
If we want one out of those what would my fraction be	One third	3.0
Miss Isla what did you pick	I picked three triangles	3.0
Count them again	Four	3.0
Look at what they have and how could you make the same shape they have without using four triangles or two rhombuses	This correct	0.0
You do it	No you hes number  Im number one	0.0
Number twos are doing this one	Number two	0.0
I wonder whos got it	I know	0.0
I know	Im number two	0.0
Alright you may talk as a table now	wait	0.0
wait	Yes and can we do it  Can you	0.0
This doesnt work	What	0.0
Miss Lauren how did you determine what the answer was	My group helped	0.0
You have no idea why thats the answer	I was trying to check it on my paper but I couldn t make sense of it	0.0
Okay so do you think they have it right	I don t know	0.0
What is the blue one worth	Two thirds	3.0
One third plus one third equals	Two thirds	3.0
What does that give us	Four sixth	3.0
Four sixth	Four sixth	1.0
Josh what does it give us	Four sixth	3.0
Well is four sixth the same thing as two thirds	No	0.0
Not the same thing but it is	Equivalent	3.0
If I have two thirds and I have four sixth if I put my triangles on top of my rhombuses does it work	Yes	0.0
What is my trapezoid worth	Three	3.0
How much of my whole is it worth	Three	3.0
Whats the right answer	Four	3.0
How much is it worth	One	3.0
How many days does it take to make a hole Dylan	Four	3.0
How many do we have	One	3.0
Cats	And dogs	0.0
Melanie	You can t add them together because theyre not	3.0
So what must we do first	Find the common denominator	3.0
Alex how do we find a common denominator for that	Multiply four by three and then the common denominator on both sides is going to be 12	4.0
Okay cool	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	3.0
Why did you say there at the end whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Because if you cut the pizza more youre changing the number of slices that you care about	4.0
Good so whatll my numerator be	Three	3.0
Ladies and gentlemen what will my actual answer be	Three twelfths	3.0
We have three in this numerator we have one in this numerator	Four	3.0
Four	And the answer is	0.0
But now we have a problem is four twelves equal to those other ones	No	0.0
Anybody figure out which ones wrong	No	0.0
You guys all said that this was one sixth yes you did it its right there but what did we establish how many of these did we need to fill the entire shape		3.0
We needed 12 so each one of those shouldnt have been one sixth what should it have been	One twelve	3.0
One twelve	two	1.0
What does the board say is equal to one		3.0
But what is the problem that were trying to solve say what was one whole	Two hexagons	3.0
Mr David how many rhombuses do you need to fill them all	Six	3.0
If you take one of them out of there whats your fraction	Five	3.0
One out of how many did you need	Six	3.0
Did it work	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Were going to compare two fractions now in which we must find a common denominator	What if you already know the answer without the common denominator	2.0
Gabriella are you waiting for something	No	0.0
Explain to them	They all got it	1.0
So explain it to him	I know no	0.0
I know no	Do I need this	0.0
Do I need this	Which is bigger	3.0
Which is bigger	Two sixth	3.0
Help him to understand why you know the answer	This is a six take two of these but equal	3.0
This is a six take two of these but equal	Then this is one third so which is bigger	2.0
Then this is one third so which is bigger	Isnt it	0.0
Isnt it	Thats one so what you get	2.0
Which one is bigger	This becomes six  so its equivalent	4.0
Simple	Thats what I did	0.0
Nobody had this is as an answer and this is the right answer	I realize now	0.0
I realize now	I now realize	0.0
Doesnt this look the same	Yes	0.0
Why does it not work	Because the triangles are upside down	4.0
Are these the same	No	0.0
Are they the same size	No	0.0
We added	Cut	3.0
But could I do it this way	Could have glued  together	3.0
So then one third and one third are they the same	Yes	0.0
What are you doing youre just grabbing things	No	0.0
What shape would break it into three pieces	This	3.0
This	No thats a whole	1.0
Your eraser	No	0.0
You all take a whole and put the shapes on until you find one that cuts it into three even pieces	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Wait no I need one more	0.0
You guys have no problem with this question the way I wrote it	I have problems	3.0
Alex whats the problem	With nothing we have on here can go on to one hexagon twelve times	0.0
What is the largest denominator we could possibly make with the shapes we have	Six	3.0
Six	Six	1.0
Six	This is too big	3.0
Because somebody has too much	Who has too much	0.0
Who has too much	I don t have any	0.0
What is that giving us	You still need one more triangle	1.0
But youre comparing which ones bigger	I know which is bigger	0.0
Which one	You just need one triangle right here	1.0
You just need one triangle right here	We just need a triangle right here and a triangle right here	1.0
So Miss Isla how do we find a common denominator	multiply both	3.0
No way we could come up with a common denominator without multiplying these two together	When power	0.0
Lincoln	Two times three	3.0
Whatever we	Do to the bottom we must do to the bottom	3.0
Whatever we do to the bottom we must do to the bottom	No	0.0
Thats what you just said	We got confused because everybody else was	0.0
The point of todays lesson was that you should be able to understand how to break things into pieces but isnt it just easier to do it mathematically	Yes	0.0
Close up your notes	Can I go get	0.0
I can t hear you	Is that our homework	0.0
Mr Asher which one is larger	Seven ninth	3.0
Seven ninth	Wait	0.0
I cant hear	Seven ninth	3.0
Can we use eight	No	0.0
No	maybe	1.0
Can we use 12	No	0.0
What about 16	No	0.0
What about 20	No	0.0
What about 24	No	0.0
What about 28	No	0.0
32	No	0.0
36	Yes	0.0
If we want to get 36 as our denominator Mr Dylan what do I multiply four by to get to 36	Nine	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You also do the top	3.0
Melanie	Four	3.0
Lovely	Whatever we do to the bottom	3.0
Lee	The new numerator is going to be 12	3.0
Which ones bigger		3.0
If you can get it all done showing all your work you have no homework	It looks like another homework we had	0.0
What do we get when we multiply these together		3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	Also to the top	3.0
So give me my answer	Mr Parker can I please get help	2.0
Did you write what I put on the board	Yes	0.0
You cant tell which ones bigger because you didnt leave a space to put it	What	0.0
Do the trick	Nine	3.0
We want each one to equal 18 right	Yes	0.0
Whatever we do to the bottom	We must do to the top	3.0
Tell me whats nine time one	Nine times one is nine	3.0
Eight times two	Eight times two	0.0
Eight times two	8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16	3.0
Whats bigger sixteen eighteenths or nine eighteenths		3.0
Thats how you do it	Okay thank you	0.0
Jessica which of these two words are you familiar with	Fractions	3.0
What do fractions mean to you	Parts	3.0
Mr Easton	Parts of a set	3.0
Parts of	Group	3.0
Bennett	I have heard of it but I dont know what it means	0.0
Okay Adam what do you think	I think it means I dont know	0.0
Okay Dominic	Decomposing mean when something breaks apart	3.0
Jessica what do you think	It means that it grabs some stuff and I think they turn it into dirt	3.0
Thats close	Turn stuff into fertilizer	3.0
Does anybody know just what it is that earthworms redworms use to create fertilizer	Trash	3.0
Trash and	Soil	3.0
They create nutrients for the soil	They use food	3.0
Thats one of the things they will do	Dirt	3.0
They dont necessarily decompose the dirt they add the nutrients to the dirt	I think maybe leaves	3.0
Animals that are in nature where do they go to the bathroom	The woods	3.0
We are going to be decomposing	Fractions	3.0
Luis	Breakdown	3.0
How could I break this down fractionally	Ripping like half	3.0
Okay so how would I do that	Down in the middle	3.0
As long as I cut along this line here this should be half correct	Yes	0.0
But essentially what have I done	You discomposed it	3.0
Ive decomposed one Kleenex into	Two Kleenex	3.0
Do you agree with him	No	1.0
Are these two Kleenexes	Yes	0.0
Youre telling me that thats two Kleenexes would everyone agree with Finn that that is two Kleenexes	Yes	1.0
When I took my scissors and cut this in half did I cut it into two Kleenexes	No	0.0
How about size are they the same size	No	0.0
When I cut that original Kleenex into two pieces those pieces are not wholes are they	No	0.0
What are these pieces	Halves	3.0
Halves	Two Halves	1.0
As we know from our work with fractions in the last unit two halves put together makes	One whole	3.0
If I only have one of these pieces so if I were to cut it in I use that one and I still have this one left do I still have a Kleenex	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	You have one	3.0
No	Half	3.0
Half	Half	1.0
Anybody want to bet me	No	0.0
Now nobody thinks its a half just because I said it wasnt	They do	0.0
You just said that what I did was I took a whole Kleenex and I cut it in two pieces and if I have one its 12 right	Yes	0.0
Its actually how much	Four halfs	3.0
What do you think	One fourth	3.0
Okay but to make 14 dont I need to have two cuts	No	0.0
Did I make two cuts	No you did one but then you rip the other one	3.0
I promise I did not rip anything I say	Can we say open it up	3.0
To make 14 how many cuts do I normally need	Two	3.0
Did I make two cuts	No	0.0
What do you guys think	I think it is 14	3.0
I was just talking to that group they thought that too but the problem with that is to make 14 of something how many cuts do you need to have	Two	3.0
Did I make two cuts	No	0.0
What do you guys think	I think its 12	3.0
I think its 12	I think it is 14	1.0
Lets hear the 12 first	Its four pieces	3.0
Its four pieces	Did you see that the original 12 was a whole and then you split it into two it will become a half because if it was a 14 it could become smaller piece	4.0
Adam what do have to say about	Because the two pieces you chose if you connect them they make 12 of a whole	4.0
Because the two pieces you chose if you connect them they make 12 of a whole	It takes four pieces to make a whole	4.0
What you think it is and why	I think its 12 because if the 12 of the whole was a whole and you would split it into two it will be 12	4.0
Tell them not me	I think it is 14 because two pieces of tissue make a 12 of the whole because it takes four pieces to make a whole	4.0
Im not going to tell you what the right answer is	Were going to figure it out	0.0
Tell us why	Theyre already connected like this	3.0
Theyre already connected like this	However if you split into two this way you could both	3.0
You said you thought that Sadie was right	Its hard	0.0
This time those of you that think Adam is correct you are going to try to convince the others that you are right here we go go	Because yes he did cut the tissue in 12 and when you ripped it apart	4.0
Are we convincing them	Were trying	0.0
Bennett who did you agree with Sadie or Adam	Sadie	1.0
Who did you side with	Sadie	1.0
Is there anybody in here who feels so strongly that they are correct that they would be willing to make a wager with me	Whats a wager	0.0
What do you have to know Laurel	How many cuts youve done	3.0
How many	One	3.0
What other evidence do we need to know as to who is right Dominic	That you opened it into two	3.0
That you opened it into two	You opened each piece into different things things	3.0
What do you mean by each piece explain	You open the pieces that you cut in half and then there are four pieces	3.0
It was like there was a hidden piece	Yes	0.0
Okay good	The number of pieces changed and the	3.0
Did I make any additional cuts	No	0.0
Because you all thought when I cut it in half that there were how many pieces	Two	3.0
This is one whole Kleenex as far as you know correct	Yes	0.0
Mathematically what changed	Nothing	3.0
Wrong	What	0.0
What changed Lola	What changes is that you had one whole but now you decomposed it into two	3.0
I didnt actually start with one whole I started with two holes but under the pretense of even though these are two separate pieces when they were together did we view them as separate pieces or as one whole	One whole	3.0
This one whole even though I didnt cut it when I separate it how many pieces that I actually make	Two wholes	3.0
Because if I would have separated them first like so what would I need to do to those two to make them look like these Rosalie	Cut them both in half	3.0
Because if I just took this first one and I cut it right down the middle I mean this isnt going to be perfect because Im just ripping it right now but if I cut it right down the middle do I have the same thing	No	0.0
Really how many cuts did I make	Two	3.0
What I did was I cut at one time it looked like two pieces of paper but when I pulled them apart how many did I actually have	Two	3.0
Two	Four	1.0
What was the first thing you had to do	Had to find the right one	3.0
How did you know what the right one is	I had to attempt to put them in circles	3.0
What do you mean	Originally I first started looking for the green ones	3.0
And what happened	Grabbed three of them and they did not make threefourths	3.0
How do you know	Because this is onehalf	4.0
Told you	Oh its more	3.0
Whats the first thing you tried to do Selena	I looked for my fourths	3.0
I love that but what do you mean by I looked for my fourths	I looked for ones thats equal to fourth like big fourth	3.0
Whats the first thing you have to figure out	Look for the color that only has four pieces	3.0
Could you still figure out they were fourths even if you had 10 of them	Yes	0.0
Derek how did you know	I knew it because we had four pieces of it the two parts are covering the top half and the two bottom ones one on the bottom half then equals threefourths	4.0
Luis	All right	0.0
All right	When you put four of those pieces together equals  equivalent to a whole	3.0
Of our fraction which of the two pieces are you actually looking for the numerator or the denominator	Denominator	3.0
You need to identify which of these pieces does it take four of to make one circle then once you put all four of those yellow ones on you simply take one off and what is left	Threefourths	3.0
I dont want to discourage you because thats good thats an equivalency but I want the actual fraction threefourths but with no number three	One and a half out of two	0.0
For now	Six eighths	3.0
Six eighths	Is this	0.0
Dominic your hand is up what	The part that is shaded is threefourths	3.0
Thats just the picture theres no fractions there	Oh	0.0
Okay	Do I have it	0.0
Watch what Tessa did and see if it makes sense to you	I did onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth	3.0
Tell them why did you choose onefourth plus onefourth plus onefourth	It would equal that when you added these three together because theyre equals three but you never add the denominator	4.0
Does everybody understand that	Yes	0.0
Use your words to describe what you see	I see three out of four circles	3.0
Out of one circle	Yes	0.0
If you have one yellow piece in your circle Ben what do you have	One	3.0
How many of these did we need to fill the whole thing up	Four	3.0
You have one out of	Four	3.0
What you should currently have in your first circle is this correct	Yes	0.0
Leslie what is it you see	Twofourths	3.0
Derek is that what you see	Yes	0.0
Anybody see anything different	Yes I do	1.0
Mr Griffin you have your hand up now you didnt see twofourths what did you see	They are onefourth	3.0
Somebody who did what they actually Lets see something else Easton what do you see	Onehalf	3.0
Uhoh Easton didnt say he sees twofourths he said he sees onehalf so whos right	Both	1.0
Talk to your tablemates why are they both correct	But its also twofourths	3.0
Tell them I already know	look like foureighths to you	1.0
Whos right	Both	1.0
Why	Because theyre adding	1.0
If youre doing onehalf theres no adding so how are you saying theyre both right	Because they  the same	1.0
Huh	Theyre equivalent	1.0
Thats just it because theyre equivalent	I said they are both half of	1.0
When you say that Hope what do you mean	That they  the same amount	1.0
What do you see in front of you do you see onehalf or do you see twofourths	I see both	3.0
Youre all wrong theyre not both right	What	0.0
Because	Theres two	3.0
Keep going theres two what	Theres two pieces	3.0
Go	Wait on our papers or	0.0
Heres my question are those the same thing	Not really	0.0
Theres no not really the answer is no they are not	It takes two pieces to make	3.0
But are they the same amount	Yes	1.0
May I borrow	Yes sure	0.0
If I ordered a pizza and I had this much left and it looked just like this and I wanted to eat this Easton what would I be eating	Onehalf	3.0
If that remaining pizza was cut into two pieces that looked like this what would I be eating Hope	Twofourths	3.0
What if I only ate this guy	Onefourth	3.0
And then if I eat this guy	Twofourths	3.0
But does it look the same	No	0.0
Yes now try to do another one	The  pieces	0.0
How many of these does it take to make a whole	Six	3.0
Correct	Yes	0.0
Yes	Okay I wrote threesixth	3.0
Wow you guys are doing good at this I wasnt sure if you guys would pick this up did you get it	36	3.0
No because in order to be onehalf it would be these or these but theyre not	Oh	0.0
Get it	I got 28	3.0
To make a whole circle	Six	3.0
Six becomes our	Denominator	3.0
How many of those blue shapes do you see Ishmael	Three	3.0
What is that one worth	16	3.0
How many of those did you say we had	One	3.0
Class what would it be equal to	36	3.0
Which we also know because were superintelligent people is equal to	Onehalf	3.0
This is what we actually see with the blue shapes correct	Yes	0.0
Now is that correct	Yes	1.0
Why dont we multiply six times three and get 18 on the bottom	You dont multiply denominator because its still	0.0
You dont multiply denominator because its still	Hes correct	1.0
Why	Because 16 times three is 16 plus 16 plus 16	4.0
Please tell your classmates what you just told me why that is correct	That is correct because 16 times three is 16 plus 16 plus 16	4.0
Repeated	Addition	3.0
Well heres one group heres two groups heres three groups and when we put them together we get	36	3.0
Yes	Is the math homework hard	0.0
I dont think so	Are you going to come back when	0.0

Do I now have a complete sentence	Yes	0.0
Talk as your table do I have a complete sentence on the board	Yes	0.0
Tell me why or why not	He doesnt have	0.0
Why do you think its a complete sentence	Something was running home	4.0
Something was running home	Its usually not	0.0
Why do you think that is a complete sentence	Because without an answer its not wholly complete	4.0
But is that the right answer to complete that sentence	No	0.0
Do you think its a complete sentence	Wrong answer	3.0
Ashley why do you think its a complete sentence	I think its a complete sentence because you put a number which is incorrect	4.0
I think its a complete sentence because you put a number which is incorrect	So an incorrect answer	4.0
If I hear you right what youre saying is its a complete sentence its just an incorrect complete sentence	What	0.0
Blake read me that sentence out loud please	I flew like a fish	0.0
Is that a complete sentence	Yes	0.0
Is it a good sentence	No	0.0
Even though it is a complete sentence does it make sense the way its written	No	0.0
No	I flew like a bird	0.0
What about now	Yes	0.0
Is everybody understanding what a number sentence is	Yes	0.0
What is that trapezoid	Onehalf	3.0
One half of a donkey	Onehalf of a whole	3.0
A donkey	Hexagon	3.0
Sit down	Broke	0.0
What would I have to put with that red trapezoid to make one whole Diana	Another trapezoid	3.0
Everybody agree	Yes	1.0
Please finish your number sentence	Thank you	0.0
Yes have we completed it	Is a trapezoid	3.0
Is that a complete sentence	Yes	0.0
Is it true	Yes	0.0
Does onehalf plus onehalf equal one whole hexagon	Yes	0.0
Really Knox what did he just do	He says he grabbed three	3.0
Wrong	I said rhombuses	3.0
Whats the point of me saying I want you talking and working as a team Lucy	What the point is that to share what the persons thinking and to help each other	3.0
If Seth is not talking to him about it is that helping Simon to learn any of this information	No	0.0
Aiden if you dont understand what somebody is doing should you be asking them questions	Yes	0.0
All right Anybody needs more time with this or do we think weve all got a pretty good grasp of these first three	We all have a good	0.0
Mr Tanner can you give me one of your other two number sentences youve created	We have one thats threesixth plus threesixth	3.0
What shape Only Tanner	So its three rhombuses and three trapezoids	3.0
Am I holding up one whole	Yes	0.0
Everybody is in agreement that I have one whole	Yes	1.0
Mr Chance please tell me one of the number sentences your team came up with	When you put onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth	4.0
How many onesixths did you have Mr Chance	Six	3.0
Do you think we are doing what we are supposed to be doing when we are talking in groups	No	0.0
Does it do it any good for Mr Chance to have an answer onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth if he doesnt know what it means	No	0.0
Would everyone agree that we have one whole	Yes	1.0
Would everybody agree with that	Yes	1.0
Mr Charles please tell me what it is	Our team came up with onethird plus onethird plus onethird	4.0
What was your answer in fraction form	One whole	3.0
What fraction would you get by adding one half plus one half	Two halves	3.0
Does everybody agree	Yes	1.0
Why is two halves the same things as one	Youve got both pieces so youve got	3.0
It doesnt explain why twohalves equals one whole	Yes but  doesnt understand	2.0
Yes but  doesnt understand	Why do you	2.0
Twohalves why does it equal one	Twohalves equals one because	0.0
Why	Because we have onehalf	4.0
Because we have onehalf	I know	0.0
Mr Javier why is twohalves equal one whole	If you have a whole right here and	3.0
If you have a whole right here and	Because the numerator is the same as the denominator which means that you  by two pieces to  add a two to make one whole	4.0
Because the numerator is the same as the denominator which means that you  by two pieces to  add a two to make one whole	If we take one piece away we would have a half so this is one half and this is onehalf	4.0
If we take one piece away we would have a half so this is one half and this is onehalf	But if you only had one  out of the whole then it wouldnt be a whole	4.0
But if you only had one  out of the whole then it wouldnt be a whole	So  add another half so it will be a whole	4.0
Explaining your math thinking isnt always easy is it	I can explain it	0.0
All right Mr Charles please stand up and tell the class why you think twohalves is equal to one	One half plus one half is two twos because you dont add the denominator	4.0
But why is two twos as youre calling it twohalves equal the one	Because if you have enough pieces that theyre equal to your denominator then it makes a whole	4.0
So following up that Diana can you help him out finish this out	Okay	0.0
Okay	So the denominator is how many pieces that you need to make one whole and if the denominator is two and the numerator is two so you have enough to make one whole	4.0
Because what does the numerator tell us	That you have two pieces	3.0
Twohalves one well its because of what they just said your denominator tells us what Chance	How many pieces you have	3.0
Jessica	How many pieces we have left over	3.0
No thats the remainder	How many wholes we have back in store	3.0
What does the denominator tell us	How many pieces we need	3.0
Walker	The total amount that you have	3.0
Daniel	The denominator tells you how many pieces in the total	3.0
So when we were dealing with our halves if this is a whole Erics what shape do I need two of	23	3.0
23	What	0.0
What	Two	3.0
Two what	Two trapezoid	3.0
So in my fraction 1212 if I put them together that equals	One whole	3.0
Show me what my improper fraction would look like	Two	0.0
For the second one what shape are we talking about for number two	Triangle	3.0
How many triangles Tanner do we need to make one whole	Triangles	0.0
Triangles	6	3.0
So if I have 6 triangles whats my numerator	Two	3.0
How many triangles do I need to make one whole again	Six	3.0
So I have six out of	Six	3.0
Theyre the blue ones	Oh	0.0
Theyre question number three	Oh yes you need three	3.0
So if I have three of them do I have one whole	Yes	0.0
Go	We what	0.0
Go	Okay	0.0
Now can you make a number sentence of that	Yes	0.0
Lets see it	Yes I can make it	0.0
Now can you make me a number sentence of that	I already did that	0.0
So Leila please explain to me visually what shapes you used to make your whole	A triangle	3.0
A triangle	This triangle plus one rhombus	3.0
What are the other ones called	A rhombus and a trapezoid	3.0
Everybody agree with that	Yes	1.0
Mr Blake	16131	3.0
16131	Oh my God	0.0
Oh my God	Oh my God thats scary	0.0
Would everybody agree that thats what we	Yes	1.0
Yes	But we did it in the wrong	3.0
Our answer should be three elevenths	What	0.0
table what did I do wrong	You never add the denominator	3.0
You never add the denominator	You should	0.0
what did I do wrong	You never added the denominator	3.0
Denominator	Yes	0.0
Okay	Because if you add the denominator	3.0
That thing	Yes that thing	0.0
Yes that thing	You get the wrong answer	3.0
So that is the right answer	No	0.0
I heard Seth say that six we should use as our common denominator so I did	Oh yes	0.0
I got it right right	No	0.0
The answer is threesixth	No	0.0
He said its six	Make six a common denominator	3.0
So my answer is right	No	0.0
No	Because whatever you do the bottom you must do to the top	4.0
So I have to multiply them all by six	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
Now I have the right answer	No	0.0
No	I didnt say you have to multiply everything by six	3.0
Its what you said	No I wasnt	0.0
So my answer should be	No	0.0
Three halves	No	0.0
You guys are all quick to point out that Im wrong but youre having a really difficult time telling me why	Im trying to tell you the top one	3.0
Talk to your team	I get three times one	3.0
I get three times one	I dont get it anymore	2.0
I dont get it anymore	I was getting it	0.0
Talk as you do so	how you find a common denominator	0.0
Did you fix	No	0.0
When we put on our trapezoid	No that is the wrong answer	3.0
No that is the wrong answer	Oh my God	0.0
Oh my God	I dont know what that means	2.0
I dont know what that means	Were not doing that	0.0
Is there anybody who can come up here and be the Mr Parker and tell us why	No	0.0
Miss Leia is now the Mr Parker	So you got three numbers and since this is the denominator	4.0
So you got three numbers and since this is the denominator	So what  because you covered three triangles on one half	4.0
So what  because you covered three triangles on one half	So the one half becomes threesixth	4.0
So the one half becomes threesixth	Then the onethird covered two	4.0
Does everybody understand what shes talking about when she says that	Yes	1.0
Everybody	Yes	0.0
Lucy how did Leia your teammate get threesixth out of one half	Because out of one half because you put three triangles on the rhombus	4.0
Does everyone agree	Yes	1.0
What Leia did was she said one half equals threesixths and when shes saying one half equals threesixths shes saying that we need to break it into six pieces	Oh	0.0
How did you go from two to six	Because if you multiply two	3.0
so talk to the classmates tell me what to do	So you multiply two times three because it equals six	4.0
Okay then	and then you get your answer threesixths	3.0
Does that look familiar	Yes	0.0
All right what about the next one Leia	Onethird becomes twosixths	4.0
Onethird becomes twosixths	If you multiply three times two and then one times two you get twosixths and onesixths is	4.0
Four	I made a fish	0.0
Take a look at this one up here	I got	0.0
Why can we not use three thirds and two halves in this problem talk	Thats why two out of two didnt work	4.0
Thats why two out of two didnt work	Then you got this	4.0
Then you got this	How many times did this go into this	2.0
You can answer this question now	You can not do two halves	3.0
Charles youre not one of those three youve done all the talking in your team but I want other people to talk	Simon talk you never talk	0.0
Is two halves equal to one	Yes	0.0
Is threethirds equal to one	Yes	0.0
Is threethird equal to one	Got any ideas	2.0
Got any ideas	No idea why its not two out of two or three out of three	2.0
No idea why its not two out of two or three out of three	How many times could this go to this	2.0
Why wont they work	They wont work because we cant multiply anything to three to get two and we cant multiply anything to two to get three	4.0
Why do we want to get to those numbers	Because	0.0
If I take two thirds can I make a half	No	0.0
No	You have an extra one	3.0
And if I have a half does it equal a third	No	0.0
What does work	is	0.0
What denominator does work	Six	3.0
Are all of those shapes the same	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
Its possible	I think you just	0.0
Walker let other people think about what you are saying	We can all cover	0.0
Because it feels at first like nothing	You know how Mr  when you were talking about	0.0
What do those three shapes have in common	That they can	0.0
That they can	The can all be	0.0
The can all be	He said no using triangles	0.0
He said no using triangles	Tri means three	3.0
One word	Triangle	3.0
You were so close	Dividable	3.0
Charles	Sixths	3.0
Got it	What	0.0
As you work this is a team assignment today	Okay	0.0
Do we all know what collaboratively means	Yes	0.0
Yes	Were working together	3.0
I always ask you to show your work right	Yes	0.0
I always ask you to show your work right	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Juliana did you have a question	Do you finish the  first and go over one answer at a time	0.0
You hear now Mr Sean	Yes	0.0
Yes	Thank you	0.0
Everybody hearing that	Yes	0.0
Brian what is the first question wanting us to do	Wants to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers	3.0
Good but which improper fraction do they want us to convert	385	3.0
Now you should be writing this in your journal	You do not have enough space on your paper unless you want to use the backside to do this	0.0
Get to a sheet on your paper where you can do this	Should I get a new paper	0.0

You think you can handle it	No	0.0
Come on somebody be brave be bold	I can not do all three	0.0
What do you think I would talk about first off	You will talk about how do you convert them to a mixed number	3.0
What have I made the biggest deal about lately when dealing with fractions in general	Common denominator	3.0
Youre about to lose your classroom dude	Hes going to get fired	0.0
I would start this lesson by talking about what does our denominator tell us in this problem	Our denominator tells us	0.0
Lets do this you talk Ill write	What does the denominator mean in this problem	2.0
What does the denominator mean in this problem	What	0.0
What	Pete	0.0
Pete	Denominator is the main problem	3.0
Denominator is the main problem	What	0.0
What	Andre	0.0
Andre	A denominator	0.0
In this problem	In this problem the denominator is five so	3.0
The board doesnt care Mr Parker	Five	3.0
Five	How many do we need to make what	2.0
Repeat what you said	The five tells us how many pieces we need to make one	3.0
What one	One whole	3.0
One whole	One cow	0.0
One cow	One whole	3.0
When I taught yesterday what did I use as my wholes	Used marbles	3.0
Used marbles	No	1.0
Who can tell our Mr Parker what I used as wholes yesterday	Candy bars	3.0
Whether I was talking about candies or marbles what was my whole	Six	3.0
Now that you know what were dealing with	So then its 385	3.0
So then its 385	We need to find out how many pieces go We need to find out how many bags we have	3.0
If were dealing with marbles and bags	How many bags we can make that are full	3.0
Joanna	How many candy bars fit in the bag	3.0
Can we use marbles and bags	Marbles	3.0
Remi	How many enclosed in the bag	3.0
If that improper fraction represented our marbles and how many marbles and how many marbles went in each bag what would our answer tell us	How many complete	3.0
Juliana	It tells us how many bags we need to put all the marbles in	3.0
Now ironically when we create a mixed number will they all necessarily be full bags	No	0.0
How would I go about solving this using the class	You would draw a picture	3.0
First Id ask the class	What is the first thing we have to do	2.0
What is the first thing we have to do	Camden	0.0
Camden	Draw a picture	3.0
Emerson	You have to dray 38 circles and make groups of five	3.0
You said I have to draw 38 circles	Yes	0.0
Yes	Draw 38 circles	3.0
What would I say	We should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	3.0
Thats what I would say	groups of 10 because since theres five to fill a bag each row should have	4.0
And because 10 is a friendly number	So next	0.0
So next	What do we do next	2.0
Thats what I like to do	Milo	0.0
Who can be able to help	Jake	1.0
Talk louder	Convert the proper fraction	3.0
Call on somebody else	Jack	0.0
Jack	You would sort the circles into bags	3.0
Your answer is right but just be more specific	You can	0.0
How many go in each one	I think its 5 or 10	3.0
Thea Can you clarify	Youre going to make group of five in each row	3.0
Why	Because thats how many are going to fit in one bag	3.0
Speak up	A whole	3.0
What does our denominator Marie tell us in this problem	How much can fit into the bag	3.0
How many poodles	How many	0.0
Donkeys minivans spaceships	Marbles	3.0
Keep going	Can fit in the bag	3.0
Five marbles equals what	One whole	3.0
Is that kind of important in this question	Yes	0.0
Okay Mr Parker keep going	Jacob what do you do now	2.0
Now can you put numbers inside	Yes	0.0
Do you have to	No	0.0
If you think you can do an accurate count  you dont have to but if you think youre worried about your count make sure youre drawing numbers inside so count	One two three four five	0.0
One two three four five	That will be seven	3.0
That will be seven	You should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	1.0
You should probably be doing what we are doing on the board	I already did it	3.0
What would I do now Mr Gale	Count how much wholes you have	3.0
Mr Gale what question do you think I would ask right now	How much circles are these	2.0
Its how many	How much the wholes is	2.0
How much the wholes is	There are seven wholes	1.0
Seven whole what	How many do we have left	2.0
Start talking louder	Camden	0.0
Lets call on somebody who was paying attention please	Juliana	0.0
Juliana	Theres three left  not enough to fill a whole bag	3.0
Theres three left  not enough to fill a whole bag	Three what	2.0
Three what	Three marbles they dont have enough to fill a whole bags	3.0
Three marbles they dont have enough to fill a whole bags	Now whats the  the problem Thea	2.0
Now whats the  the problem Thea	The total of the fraction what the fraction is	3.0
The total of the fraction what the fraction is	The fraction is 7 35	3.0
Angela	I forgot what I was going to say	0.0
I forgot what I was going to say	Whats the mixed number	3.0
Whats the mixed number	Whats the mixed number	2.0
Whats the mixed number	7 35	3.0
7 35	The question should be asking for the fraction	3.0
The question should be asking for the fraction	How did we get that	2.0
How did we get that	How did we get the 35	2.0
How did we get the 35	Antonio	1.0
Do you need your Mr Parker to repeat the question	Repeat your question then	0.0
Repeat your question then	Huh	0.0
Huh	Repeat your question	0.0
Hes in the back of the room	How do we get that answer	2.0
The question was how did we get the 35	We got the 35 because the remainder was 3 then theres a 5 so its going to be 35	4.0
Why isnt it 7 338	Because its the numerator that change	4.0
This class is just inspiring	Juliana	0.0
Good thing I talk a lot	Because you need five to fill up one bag and theres three left so you dont have one full bag	4.0
Five chicken to fill up the KFC bucket	Yes KFC	0.0
Yes KFC	You left with a sack and you have three marbles leftover to fill up a sack but you dont have all the five and you need five have to fill up the sacks you got three out of five left	4.0
Everybody agree with that	Yes	1.0
Does that help them understand why we do that	No	0.0
What would we call this method	Picture	3.0
Picture	Picture	1.0
Multiplication addition subtraction anything what is the benefit of doing multiple methods	You can get better at something	3.0
Antonio	Why and how it works	3.0
Why multiple methods works and why when you do partial products you should always check your answers with division	So that with multiple methods we can see if	3.0
So that with multiple methods we can see if	we get the same answer	3.0
What happens if we dont	We have to return our	3.0
Now if you do multiple methods and you get the same answer what does that pretty much tell you	Its right	3.0
Michelle	5x7	3.0
Very good and Ms Michelle what is 5x7	35	3.0
Then when we subtract Ryan what are we left with	Three	3.0
Is three less than five	Yes	0.0
Lets do this since that marker clearly does not like	Well use another marker	0.0
Every time we take away five of our marbles that equals one more of what	Sacks	3.0
Every time we take away one group of five marbles that equals one sack right	Yes	0.0
We would have 33 we take away one more sack were left with 28 23 18 13	Eight	3.0
Eight	Then three	3.0
How many sacks would that be	Seven	3.0
Seven	Seven	1.0
What do these three represent	Marbles	3.0
We have 7 38 sacks of marbles	38	0.0
Any questions	No	0.0
No	No questions	0.0
Question	Should we do the bottom as well	0.0
Thats  the exact same thing because a decimal represents the separation of wholes and parts so when we say 7 35 our wholes are 7 and we are separating our parts	Which one are we doing	0.0

Youre done	Biggest number minus	3.0
Biggest number minus	Yes	1.0
Yes	So seven minus	3.0
So seven minus	Seven minus	1.0
Lacy	into different parts	3.0
what does partial mean	Part	3.0
What does partial products mean to you when we did partial products	Partial products means splitting multiplication of bigger numbers into smaller numbers	3.0
Michael	I think partial products means when you have a big multiplication problem you break it up into tiny pieces to get products	4.0
I think partial products means when you have a big multiplication problem you break it up into tiny pieces to get products	Then at the end you add all the products	4.0
Cameron	So that it could be easier	4.0
Youre right but what do you mean by easier	Its a little bit easier to solve the problem	3.0
Think about it	Because if we dont want to multiply a big number	3.0
We are multiplying big numbers but think of exactly how were doing	so many times	3.0
what do my horns do	Your horns  the value	3.0
Were multiplying singledigit numbers with what at the end of them	Zero	3.0
Whats seven times five	35	3.0
whats it called	The dividend	3.0
What does this tell us Cameron	How many pieces	3.0
Keep going Cameron	in total	3.0
Total	Marbles	3.0
Daniela	Divisor	3.0
Lacy	Number of marbles per bag	3.0
Lynn	The	0.0
Already got that one	How many bags like	3.0
How many bags like	How many bags you have	1.0
How many bags you have	how many bags you have	1.0
how many bags you have	Groups	1.0
If the six tells us the number of groups then this tells us	Oh its just backwards	3.0
Make sense	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense to everybody	Yes	0.0
Guess what you do in your thinking box	Think	0.0
What could you use that for	Thinking	0.0
Does Cameron know know exactly what we should use	No	0.0
Thats when you  but the problem is how many times does six go into five	Zero	3.0
Delilah how do we know	By place value	3.0
Does the question change	No	0.0
The question is what it is right	Yes	0.0
It is we need to figure out how many times six goes into our total as close to it as we can get without going	Over	3.0
why cant we use that	Because its larger than the dividend and if you try and subtract it from your divided then its going to be a negative	4.0
Explain it using the marble problem	You would have 135 marbles but you wanted to take away 600	4.0
You would have 135 marbles but you wanted to take away 600	You cant do that because you dont have 600	4.0
Jack why cant I do this	Because of the	0.0
Zach why not	Because its bigger than the dividend	4.0
What does that mean	We cant multiply it	3.0
Lacy please restate what Ms  said so that Jack and Zach can hear it and pay attention this time	You cant do 600 because if you only had 135 marbles you couldnt use 600	4.0
If I tell you to go and clean the windows with a squeegee can you do it	No	0.0
Why not	Because you dont have a squeegee	0.0
If I tell you to ride your bike down the halls can you do it	No	0.0
Table one what do you think we should start with	I think we should start with six times 5	3.0
Table two	We did six times 20	3.0
Table three	6 times 10	3.0
Table four	Six times	3.0
Table four	6 times 20	3.0
How many of you want me to tell you which ones right	Which one	0.0
Arianna	Its not too big and its not too small	4.0
Now Lacy do you have that down	Yes	0.0
Can I use that to solve the problem	Yes	0.0
But is it my best choice	No	0.0
Why is it not my best choice	What did you say	0.0
Why is it not my best choice	Because  and then its kind of hard when youve got a remainder to subtract	4.0
Same exact problem no tricks but I want to show you that you can have a plethora of choices in which to solve this	60	3.0
What am I multiplying times 6	10	3.0
6 times 10 equals	60	3.0
Youre following Vanessa	Yes	0.0
Youre following Zach	Yes	0.0
Really	Yes	0.0
Do I have a six	Yes	0.0
Do I have a 10	Yes	0.0
Do I have a 60	Yes	0.0
How many bags was I able to make	10	3.0
Ms  what does it tell me	How many marbles are left	3.0
That are still	In the bucket	3.0
Is my bucket empty	No	0.0
How did I get seven	You crossed  to five you made it four	4.0
Why am I not done with the problem	Because you still	0.0
Isnt that what I was trying to do	No	0.0
What do I still have Roman	You still have 75 marbles	3.0
Isnt the goal of division to try to divide everything youve got out evenly	Yes	0.0
Ms	You know when your problem is done is when a number is smaller than six like three is smaller than six	4.0
Because what	Make another group of 10	3.0
Marcus	Because  by six	3.0
That as soon as we get a number thats smaller than six were done	Because we dont have enough marbles to fill another bag	4.0
Zach what are we trying to do in this problem	Trying to	0.0
Cameron	Were trying to accomplish how many bags	3.0
Lynn what are we trying to accomplish	We are trying to accomplish how many marbles fit in that bag	3.0
What are we trying to figure out here Lacy	Were trying to figure out what our portions is	3.0
Jason	Were trying to figure out how much bags we can make	3.0
If the question is asking how many full bags of marbles we will have do we care about the three that are leftover	No	0.0
Did you when I first taught it to you	No	0.0
Go ahead	We multiply by 10 again	3.0
We multiply by 10 again	We can	0.0
We go back to our	Thinking	0.0
Do we need to write anything else on the thinking box	No	0.0
No we can do this one again can we	Yes	0.0
60 is less than 75 right Jack	Yes	0.0
What are you waiting for	I dont know	0.0
What	Please may I go to the bathroom	0.0
Lynn	We have to subtract 75 from 60	3.0
You mean 60 from 75	Yes	0.0
Will why are we subtracting 60 from 75	Because were taking 60 marbles out of the bucket and putting them into groups of 6	4.0
When we subtract were trying to figure out	How many	3.0
Are we done	No	0.0
Brian	Because we can still have more in the bag	4.0
Now we go back to our	Thinking box	3.0
Jonah	Two	3.0
Six times two which is	12	3.0
Whats six times three	18	3.0
Lets use that one	No	0.0
What do you mean no	Because its over 15	4.0
Do I have 18 marbles	No	0.0
Class what goes on the outside	Two	3.0
What goes on the inside	12	3.0
Arianna	Three	3.0
15 takeaway 12	Is three	3.0
Are we done	Yes	0.0
Brielle how do we know were done	We knew were done because	0.0
Because three marbles left can we fill up another bag of six	No	0.0
10 plus 10 plus two is	22	3.0
How many marbles do we have leftover	Three	3.0
Three but how many marbles do we need in order to make a full bag	Six	3.0
Six	12	3.0
Now some of you most of you hopefully realize at this point that this is the same thing as	12	3.0
Were going to do 6 times 10 because we know 60 works right	Yes	0.0
Whats six times two	12	3.0
Six times 20 is	120	3.0
Can we do that one	Yes	0.0
Class whats six times three	18	3.0
Add a zero	180	3.0
With this one what do I know	That you cant do it because its bigger than	4.0
Could we do this one	Yes	0.0
Could we do six times one	Yes	0.0
What is six times one	Six	3.0
Can we do it again	Yes	0.0
Are we done	Yes	0.0
Which one of these two is better	Both	3.0
Yes Emily	What happened with	2.0
What happened with	What happened Does it really have to be from the divisor	3.0
I dont know what youre talking about	Like you have	0.0
We want two bags how many marbles are we putting in	3	3.0
Two bags	12	3.0
Lynn	Can we use either one	0.0
Yes Katie	When we are doing the more easier because if we dont want to  when You know how you did 15 and we did	3.0
Down here	Yes	0.0
Yes	Do we have to find another multiple to multiply it again	3.0
Do you see how once we got to 15 we did it two different ways	Yes	0.0
Either one of those works Brian	Do we always have to write the remainder as a fraction	3.0
Is this the right answer	No	0.0
We dont care about those three extra marbles but if it said how many bags would we need to put all of the marbles in what would my answer be	23	3.0
What	You cant write like R then put the number that you have for the remainder	3.0
Lets get about 10 minutes in here and lets see what we can figure out	May I go to the restroom	0.0
Three minutes	Wait I have a question	2.0
Yes maam	Do we use this the dividend	3.0
Do we use this the dividend	Or do we use the	3.0
All alright Mr Jack	Jack	0.0
The answer is yes always because the divisor tells us either how many groups were going to have or how many per group we have right	Yes	0.0
Did everybody hear that	Yes	0.0
Gavin what did I just say	Use	0.0
Without that number you cant do a thinking box	You cant do it backwards like	3.0
No your first number is always your divisor	Always your divisor okay	0.0
Jack what did I just say	You said that your divisor is always your first number in your thinking box	0.0
Gavin what did I just say	That your divisor is always your first number in your	0.0
What did I say Roman	The divisor	0.0
Is always	is always	0.0
the first number where	The first number in your thinking box	3.0
Now are you all going to have the same number over here	No	0.0
Arianna	Because if you do 5 x 100 you get 500 and 500 is bigger than 260	4.0
You can do 5 x 30 if you want to	Ill do that	0.0
You can start there but if youre not good at your multiplication facts what should you start with	10	3.0
Why not	Because you need to fill in another bag	4.0
This time Im going to take my divisor 5 and what should I multiply it by to get me a number of less than 16 but close to it	13	3.0
5x13	Thats 150	3.0
5x3 why did you pick 5x3	Because 15 is the closest number I could get with the 5	4.0
Ms Emily how many am I left with in my big giant container	One	3.0
Am I done	No	0.0
Whats 403	43	3.0
This is our answer and our remainder is	One	3.0
Out of	Five	3.0
Ms Emily what is our question	Is the fraction	0.0
Is what	If we put the remainder as a fraction	3.0
Guess what your homework is tonight	This	0.0

Finley	You could try 2 and 23	3.0
Someone new what is the strategy for finding the greatest common factor using prime factorization Laura	You see what the longest strand is that they share and so in this case it would be the 3s in each of them	3.0
You got it	Then because of that because they share 2 3s it would be 3 x 3 which would be 9	4.0
Stella did you do that	No  but is the greatest common factor three	3.0
The greatest common factor is nine because they both have 2 3s	Oh	0.0
Did you get to the least common multiple	Yes	0.0
Awesome whatd you do	Its 360	3.0

How  I divided it by 10 on each side and that literally takes in 24	Then how do I get to 15 for the Mrs Reevess if you cant go into 36	2.0
Its still 720 but youre now getting to every 15 cans the Mrs Reevess had	The Mrs Reevess would have 15 and then these kids would have	3.0
Then a thirdgrader	They would have 5 cans and they would have 15 cans	3.0
Yes so its still this ratio	720	3.0
Mrs Reevess is 720	Oh yes	0.0
Yes so try that instead I think then youre going to have more success okay	I did what this did and whats 72	3.0
Like four or five of these up here	Yes	0.0
Maybe draw the lines remember when we talked about	Okay	0.0
Okay	Whats 72   2	2.0
Whats 70	40	3.0

I love it	Can I show you what I	0.0
Oh my gosh am I even going to be able to talk about this	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	Plus this is the rough draft so we might need to be using	0.0
Of course this is	I  to be able to figure it out	0.0
Would you guys go if youre finished	Yes	0.0
Ill give you my  and then I want to solve it	This isnt the whole problem	3.0
Oh	This will lead you to the problem the answer of these and you have to  lots of that lots of these  Then if youre  the two the first  would be C	4.0
Are these the answers	Yes yes	0.0
Yes yes	These are the answers	0.0
I would love to	Yes	0.0
Yes	the number	0.0

You what	Can I	0.0
Everyone over here what did I just say	Grab one of them	0.0
So you need to be up out of your chair  and grabbing one	Yo were going to grab them	0.0
Well now your warmup you have in your folder	Oh we do	0.0
Yes	Oh so I just grab these	0.0
Now jump to here and see if you can get more specific	Do I shade the wrong one	3.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Some really good thinking so far nice job	Are we supposed to do the warmup	0.0
You could try and figure out the exact percent but really were just going to be talking about estimation	Not quite	0.0
No youre not	You think we should	0.0
So what do you see there	Nothing	0.0
Did you read up here	No	0.0
Nice job	I actually love decimals because 6 is 6 point something and maybe 27	3.0
Okay cool	Its like each bar is 1620 which should point whatever	3.0
Angel	You can divide 240 by 6	3.0
So why would I divide 240 by 6	Well you can find out what number goes into each box	3.0
What did you get for 240 divided by 6	Oh 40	3.0
Margo whatd you do	I counted the boxes and they were eight	3.0
Okay so theres eight boxes	Then divided 160 by eight and I got 20	4.0
Then divided 160 by eight and I got 20	Then basically I counted that 20	4.0
Yes why	Why not	2.0
Clay youre ready	Yes	0.0
What would be a reasonable estimate for a percentage of freethrows for Team 1 Paulina	Maybe like around 80	3.0
Around 80 Why is that reasonable	Its closer to a hundred percent than	3.0
What percentage	50	3.0
No sorry between 50 and 100	Oh 75	3.0
Rebecca	60	3.0
Okay 60 how did you get that	a little more than half	3.0
60 maybe its a little over 60 a little under 60 I dont really know but were just estimating if thats a reasonable estimate	One way to  60 then 50 to 60 is 10 so you dont get to 90 so maybe we dont	4.0
50 60 70 80 90 Roge saying because theres only four blocks it has to be a little bit more than 10 then its probably 62 or 63 or 64 somewhere there right	It might be wrong but the first one might correct with 90	3.0
Okay	Yes what do I notice	0.0
Roge what else	50 people voted and in  a hundred	3.0
Okay so how did you get that	I added 69 to 31 and I got 100 and then did 17 and 33 I got 50	4.0
Rebecca	We have to really keep it the same	3.0
Well were really keeping it the same its true but were going to just put different clothes on it anyways so we can look at it so Michelle how could we do that	Would you add another set of	3.0
Why would we do that	Im not sure if you add another	3.0
34 its that easy so which community is more in support of building the gym	Miya	3.0
The sportswriter for East Middle School newspaper wanted to report the percentages of fans for each school use the ratio table to account for a total of a hundred spectators so we now have how many spectators at the game		3.0
Why is it going to 100 useful	Well can I explain what I did first	0.0
Well first I want people to know why we go to a hundred and then I would love to	Its easiest to get a percent when you have a 100 as the denominator	3.0
Yes its easier to get the percents when you have a 100 as the denominator as the per per 100 so we are trying to go there and did you do like the quickest jump	No I did not	0.0
No I did not	First I got it in half so I get	3.0
Okay perfect because Im trying to remind people that multiple jumps are good	Yes so that will be 200	3.0
400 divided by two gets us to 200 our goal is 100 so this is a great step Im just doing what I can do mental math to get where I want to go okay so what did you do then	Then I divided 240 by two which I got 120	4.0
Everything is getting divided by two and that way the ratio is the same so 240 divided by two is one 120	160 divided by 2 is 80	3.0
Im going to let	We decided to calculate that percent	3.0
Oh yes Whatd you figure out	For team Y its 886	3.0
886  oh okay good good job yes thats awesome and I think	Well point sixeight if thats right	3.0
Oh sorry thats 49	Yes 83	3.0
So if Im going to go from 200 spectators down to 1 River what am I going to do	Divide 200 by 2 to get 100	4.0
Nice	Then 240 divided by 2	3.0
Rebecca	40	3.0
All right whats the percent of West fans		3.0
Whats the ratio of East to West fans	East to West	3.0
East to west	For every 6	3.0
How else could I write that	46	3.0
Is this simplest	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	23	3.0
Nice job	Thats what I said	1.0
So if I say write a comparison statement for this ratio what were you about to say	For every two East fans there are three West fans	3.0
What else Rebecca	For every four East fans there are six West fans	3.0
Hermione	To ratio of East fans to West fans is 23	3.0
To start if this is the ratio like the base ratio how many people are they talking about		3.0
Clay if you want to get to percent you want per how many	Hundredths	3.0
What do you know about the relationship between 20 and 100	Far apart	3.0
They are far apart yes youre right	Or even numbers	3.0
If there were 100	We say numbers	3.0
What have you guys got	Im confused	2.0
What is your responsibility	Ask around	0.0
20x50 is 1000	Oh times five	3.0
You said it hes just doing what youre doing	Okay	0.0
So what do we do with the top numbers	Five degrees	3.0
The questions are on the back so if youve kind of figured out the table you need to flip over your page and answer the questions about your table	What table do you have	2.0
How is that going to break	Add 180 and then you would add 180 to each one of those	3.0
Right or 20 x 4	Equals 80	3.0
Yes are you  the ones in the back like I just said	I tried	0.0
Sitting back and hanging out and you dont know what  Whats your strategy	It doesnt work there	3.0
These two	Yes	0.0
How are you guys doing	I have a question	0.0
Then put the  All right	Were doing the multiple	3.0
Yes	This one  Down here is your camera	0.0
Uploading a file okay	Then you get a	0.0
Right here	65	3.0
Im sure thats what you got but youve just got to look at your sheet	I got 75	3.0

I dont have it	I said theres	0.0
For instance for ATT when they charge three cents per text message if I send two text messages how much am I spending	six cents	3.0
If I send one text message with ATT how much does it cost	No dollars	3.0
No dollars	Three cents	1.0
Three cents but if I send one text message with Verizon how much does it cost	Twenty dollars and one cent	3.0
Serena	if you were at Verizon when theres 1500 to 2500 texts and its cheaper at ATT where its zero to 500 text theyre the same at a thousand texts	4.0
Theyre the same at a thousand but really whos the better deal at 999	ATT	3.0
If youre someone who sends a lot of texts this is not the cellphone company for you	Is this is per month	3.0
Ian	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	ATT is the first one	3.0
Up this one	We cant find our paper	0.0
We cant find our paper	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Weve looked everywhere	0.0
Really today I wanted to get to 33 on top of that so lets pull that out	The Wild World	0.0
Should I reread this right here	Yes	0.0
Ian	Well if you have 100 points and for every ride that you take that it gives your card more	3.0
Whats happening to your card	Its taking away money	3.0
Its taking away not money	Points	3.0
How many points is it going to take off my card	Six	3.0
Six	Six	1.0
What is it doing	Taking six points away	3.0
Taking six points away	Taking	1.0
What do you notice from five to seven	Two	3.0
What am I taking away	Twelve	3.0
If I take away 12 what do I have	Fiftyeight	3.0
So 7 to 10 how many rides have I taken	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Fiftyeight take away 18	Forty	3.0
Forty	Forty	1.0
Then 10 to 15 how many rides have I taken	Five	3.0
Five	Five	1.0
How many points is that off	Ten	3.0
Ten	Oh no	0.0
Does everyone see how I got 30 here	Yes	0.0
If I know its six points each per ride and its a hundred points on my card the equation were about to create would help me solve Well how many rides can I go on	Sixteen	3.0
Howd you get 16	Because were at 15 rides and you have 10 but if you subtract six its four	4.0
Because were at 15 rides and you have 10 but if you subtract six its four	Thats not enough for that ride	4.0
How many more rides can I take with 10 points	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
Have I used all my points	Yes	0.0
No	Actually you cant buy another ride	3.0
For this Im really just looking for a general sentence thats like What are we doing when were solving for any number of rides	We subtract six points every time you go on a ride	3.0
Slim	A hundred	3.0
A hundred what	Points	3.0
When youre thinking about creating an equation wheres your shoe	I have	0.0
We could say well Ian	I just want to edit  otherwise well just go and well be like Okay a hundred rides	3.0
How would we create part of a yes	Youre sure to say it	0.0
You said N is the whats N	Number of rides	3.0
P equals	Points left	3.0
Griffin	You could just take away the X and	3.0
Griffin	E  6	3.0
What part of this whole	E  6 to R E  6  R	3.0
What part of the equation shows the number of bonus points at the start	A hundred	3.0
A hundred	Uhoh	0.0
What do you think Serena	I think the points left is dependent and the number of rides is independent because I mean the number of rides is just like you just go around how many times you want	4.0
I think the points left is dependent and the number of rides is independent because I mean the number of rides is just like you just go around how many times you want	It doesnt depend on anything	4.0
It doesnt depend on anything	The points on the card and  and all that depends on how many rides youre on	4.0
If my N is zero wheres my points left	A hundred	3.0
So think as rides increase whats happening to your points that are left	Should I write it down here and then the point outside	0.0
You got it	It only goes straight up	3.0
I love that youre challenging yourself with that but its picking up a whole another layer that we can discuss	Can I go change my binder	0.0
Can I go change my binder	I have to be	0.0
All your stuff that you need	Yes	0.0
Very good	Like this	0.0
Hell help you	and then you just write it	0.0
Yes well really I just wanted you to draw the relationship and just think about	This is good then	0.0
Its great but I wasnt looking for that specific just a general Hey what would happen to the line	Oh so just	0.0
Did you go out at lunch	Yes	0.0
Was it warmer	Yes	0.0
I just dont like the breezing	Is it okay if I go	0.0
Did you get a cut here or is it	Yes	0.0
Not inside	I was probably kicking around on the street  I turned my head and I see a huge ice ball coming to my face	0.0
I was probably kicking around on the street  I turned my head and I see a huge ice ball coming to my face	It hurt so bad	0.0
Gryphon what are you doing	Im watching this piece of metal	0.0
Yes	I have a question for you	0.0
Yes	right now	0.0
Do you	For that cheese	0.0
Youve got cheese	No but we cant If I had to I wouldve guessed	0.0
As I go this way as the number of rides that Ive taken increases what would I expect to happen to my number of points left	Decreasing	3.0
So at zero rides this is zero how many points do I have	One	3.0
You guys in back totally thought about this and I love it is that when I have zero points left how many rides have I taken	Eighteen	3.0
Eighteen	Fifteen	1.0
What did we say	Sixteen	3.0
Thank you for really asking	Can we stay in here	0.0
Okay tell me one thing an architect needs to consider when theyre building a gingerbread house Maddy	How many materials they need	3.0
Okay Eli	How much they cost	3.0
Yes the cost of materials	Material	0.0
Sarah	Measurement	3.0
Carrie	How much of each thing they need how long maybe	3.0
How long what needs to be	The materials theyre building with	3.0
Who can add on to that Maria	How long or wide the gingerbread needs to be	3.0
How long or wide the gingerbread needs to beMia	Area	3.0
Danielle	I think that the architect would need to consider the area because if you dont consider the area you might have a nonequal house or it might be lopsided or something	4.0
Sarah I see youve got a burning idea	Also with area you want to know the area because if your house is too big it could hit other buildings and then it would be bad	4.0
You would want to think almost about city planning	What about perimeter	3.0
Do you think we need to consider perimeter as well	Yes	0.0
Jackson	The amount of inches and how wide and how high it should be	3.0
The amount of inches and how wide and how high it should be	Basically volume	3.0
You learned about this at the very very beginning of the year	I know how to do it	0.0
You dont know what Im going to ask	is talking to me about volume here	0.0
Chloe tell me when you measure volume what are you measuring	Length	3.0
Ivy can you add to that	Width and height	3.0
Width and height	Volume	1.0
Volume	Volume	1.0
Volume	Volume	1.0
Width and height	Miss volume	3.0
Tell me more about what you mean when you say timesing it out length width and height	Timesing I used	3.0
Eli	It means youre measuring the inside of a threedimensional shape	3.0
Carrie	How much of something between sides but if you do the thing that means timesing the length width and height	4.0
How much of something between sides but if you do the thing that means timesing the length width and height	If you had eight for the height you would times it by the width lets say the width is five	4.0
If you had eight for the height you would times it by the width lets say the width is five	Then you do it again by the height and length	4.0
Maddy	Weve gotten the little cubes and then put them inside of the whole	3.0
Yes weve used cubes to measure volume	Weve also used multiplication to help us measure volume by measuring how tall it is and how long it is and the width of it because then wed multiply them together to get the volume	4.0
Okay Sarah	Rulers because yardsticks would be too long but a ruler would be a good size to figure out the size if you want squares and they would help	4.0
Jackson	Depends on the size of it	3.0
Depends on the size of it	You could use a meter stick for any of those things	3.0
Could you use	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
Yes why not	Because gummy sharks theyre not really straight	4.0
Because gummy sharks theyre not really straight	When youre building you want things to be straight so theyre not weird or lopsided and gummy sharks theyre straight and theyre also a little bit harder since theyre not necessarily flat and that could be harder and theyre very small	4.0
Danielle what do you say about gummy sharks	I disagree with Sarah because if you use the gummy sharks for the length and width you could just like This is how many gummy sharks how long it is or how tall it is	1.0
Danielle argues that you could use gummy sharks to measure the volume	I disagree with Danielle because if you want to try and measure the volume and fill it up with gummy sharks and try and measure that	1.0
I disagree with Danielle because if you want to try and measure the volume and fill it up with gummy sharks and try and measure that	Gummy sharks aint squared and the same on both sides all the sides	3.0
Okay Im going to give you some other options could you measure the volume of the gingerbread house with mini marshmallows	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Luis what do you think	Yes I guess	0.0
You guess	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Tell me a little bit more about that	Because I dont know	0.0
Chloe	I think you can because the little marshmallows are kind of like a seven unit so you can say If you measure with four you can say its four seven units long	4.0
Yes	I disagree because you need a solid thing to measure because those can easily be squished and then the house will be messed up	1.0
Okay another important consideration I havent thought about before	If theres gaps in the  they might be smaller	4.0
Why Smarties	Theyre more close to a square	3.0
You dont know	and theyre probably going to be the most accurate	3.0
Is that the shark	Yes	0.0
Yes	They get so weird	0.0
What unit would you choose and why Adrian	I would choose the mini sharks because theyre long and it might be easier to play with it	4.0
What did you say Maria	I chose Smarties because its a solid candy and it wont For the marshmallows if you squish them together its not going to be the measurement  four centimetres	4.0
I chose Smarties because its a solid candy and it wont For the marshmallows if you squish them together its not going to be the measurement  four centimetres	If you squish them its not going to be the same measurement	4.0
Can you share what you told me about the Smarties	No	0.0
Mia do you remember what he said	They stack easily	3.0
Remind me again what the word equivalent means	Equals to	3.0
Equal to	Yes	0.0
Yes	Its like a multi which means like multiple	3.0
Clarry tell me some more	Im pretty sure because its like a skip counting sort of	3.0
Im pretty sure because its like a skip counting sort of	So 2 4 6 8 10 12 et cetera	3.0
Yesterday she says its really helpful	Wow	0.0

Yes	Thats true	1.0
Thats true	Yes	1.0
Alicia is suggesting to just use eight	Because its the smallest	4.0
Two 28 and 58	78	3.0
What questions do you have about this strategy	None	0.0
23  59	Thats easy	0.0
Prove it to me	I dont have a marker	0.0
Get a paper and a pencil	This way seems really long and complicated	0.0
Its not the most efficient strategy	No I have like three different other strategies	3.0
I wonder if one of them might be the next one were going to talk about	What we did the last time	0.0
What we did the last time	So were solving the problem	0.0
So lets start	Yes	0.0
Whats the new fraction	23	3.0
Let me do this side to multiply the top and the bottom by three	We have a different strategy	3.0
We have a different strategy	Okay	0.0
Okay	Whats it	2.0
Whats it	Do you like pizza or	0.0
So did you look at the larger denominator then and you noticed that	Do you have any money in your account	0.0
I see Connor	I know what happens with	0.0
It looks like you do understand	That was in California	0.0
So I see	I do see  I think	0.0
69  59 is	119	3.0
119	Or one and two thirds	3.0
Okay  draw out  the denominator	We have multiples	3.0
We have multiples	Do skip counting by two	3.0
Thats the second problem  the second problem	That number one because  using because some people think youre counting up by	3.0
They think youre going to count up by one every time	Yes	3.0
I could see why that would have Thats why we practice with lots of different numbers	Yes	0.0
Yes	When you know how to do multiplication its easier to do fractions when youre trying to find	4.0
Why do you think that is	Because you know it in your brain	0.0
Because you know it in your brain	Its memorized	0.0
Daniel why do you think that might be	Because its required for most strategies that were using in this subject right here	4.0
Can you show the class how you solved the problem	Sure	0.0
It was 23  59	How I solved this was like that	0.0
How I solved this was like that	I know that three is a multiple of nine so I multiplied 3  to find a common denominator	4.0
I know that three is a multiple of nine so I multiplied 3  to find a common denominator	I multiplied two and got a six and then I added both of those together which would give me 119 which equals 1 and 29	4.0
Alicia	Thats what me and Christine did yesterday when we write fractions	1.0
Does his answer match Alicias	Yes	1.0
Was his strategy pretty different	Yes	1.0
You guys ready to learn another strategy	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
Thumbs to the side if youre kind of in the middle	Well if you dont want to use it you dont really like the way if fits	0.0
If you dont like it you do not have to use them	I always use Robs strategy	1.0
I always use Robs strategy	I just think it takes more time	0.0
I just think it takes more time	I only use Robs strategy	1.0
Does that sound good	Yes	0.0
Yes Daniel	I know that strategy	0.0

What two numbers will you multiply together	Six and five	3.0
What is that	Thirty	3.0
Harper what do you think	Add them	3.0
What did Rob tell us we have to do when were multiplying a fraction	Youve got to multiply the opposite denominator so for	3.0
Youve got to multiply the opposite denominator so for	Numerator and denominator	3.0
Numerator and denominator	Numerator	3.0
Numerator	For 16 you multiply 1 by 5	3.0
What did I multiple five by to get 30	Six	3.0
Six so now I need to also multiply 3  6 and that is	Eighteen	3.0
What did I multiply six by to get 30	Five	3.0
I also need to multiply one by	Five	3.0
Then I can add 1830  530 is	2230	3.0
2230	693000	1.0
Im listening for a correct answer	2330	3.0
Give me a thumbs up if you want to try quick common denominator in the next problem	No	0.0
You want to use a different strategy	I already did that one	0.0
I already did that one	I didnt do that one	0.0
Lets put  my board is getting awfully covered	Yes I think that is my strategy actually	3.0
You decide	I already know what the answer is	3.0
Do you know what that is	Twentyseven	3.0
Im going to multiply 7  3 because thats what I multiplied 9 times	Twentyone	3.0
Now to get 27 over here I multiplied the 3  9	What did you get	2.0
Now you can sum them together	Miss Im done	0.0
Which strategy do you want to try multiples or the quick common denominator	I have toilet paper	0.0
I have toilet paper	Are you sure	0.0
I want you to do that and after youre done write it underneath the fraction part and Im going to come back and check it	What did you get	2.0
What did you get	3927	3.0
3927	Why	2.0
Why	What you get	2.0
Hows this table doing	Thats 69  79	4.0
Thats 69  79	Thats 139	4.0
Is this your common denominator	Do you need help Connor	0.0
Do you need help Connor	For this problem	0.0
Is this the problem were working on	Its because I do my nine and my fours like this	0.0
Its because I do my nine and my fours like this	I put my nines like this	0.0
Make sure youre working on this problem right here	23  23	0.0
How did you find that	Okay	0.0
Okay	So if we	0.0
So if we	I got 1 and 49	3.0
I got 1 and 49	Two	3.0
Two	Two whats next	2.0
Two whats next	Then I multiplied 9  6	3.0
Then I multiplied 9  6	Then I got	0.0
Then I got	Those  three	0.0
Those  three	Six nine 18	3.0
These are the denominator	79 which one of these has the same denominator	2.0
Is that right	Whats 7  6	2.0
Whats 7  6	See thats easy	0.0
Can I show you a tool you can use	Okay	0.0
Okay	So its 39ths	3.0
So its 39ths	Whats the other  9 and your whole number in there	2.0

Were going to ask them questions and give them advice about what to do	I can see that you did try and multiply the problem originally	1.0
Do we need to change any of the numbers that are being multiplied	Yes	0.0
Which numbers need to be changed	The nine the seven and the	3.0
What should Marianne multiply first	Well for me how I do it is I dont think that she should multiply these numbers	1.0
Well for me how I do it is I dont think that she should multiply these numbers	I think that she should multiply these numbers but what I would do is I would change those number to try to get a common denominator	1.0
What numbers are you referring to	For me I would go with 3 because its 39	4.0
The quick common denominator strategy what two numbers get multiplied together	The denominator	3.0
Has Marianne drawn number models to multiply the denominators together	No	0.0
So what should be your first step Marianne	First youre going to change	3.0
Yes and three times what	Nine	3.0
Are her other number models correct	Yes	1.0
Harper	Because you multiply the nine by three then youre going to multiply  by three and you multiply the three by nine and then youre going to multiply three by nine	4.0

Then Louis youre going to decide if you agree or disagree	I think its going to be the same	3.0
I think its going to be the same	Go to 70 to 81 because I did a line if that makes sense	4.0
Go to 70 to 81 because I did a line if that makes sense	I made a sailboat	0.0
We go in here	didnt mean that	0.0
didnt mean that	Im sorry	0.0
All right I need you guys	I think that its going to be the same but bigger	3.0
How	Multiply it by two	3.0
You started what you did 81 to 51 so come back to these two points	I think thats supposed to go down to that too right	3.0
Now youre going to come down to 1 2	Oh I see that	0.0
Thats where your next point would be over one and up two	Because when you multiply zero by a number its still zero	4.0
Because when you multiply zero by a number its still zero	Zero is still zero	1.0
That is correct good	Because its going to be this part multiplied	4.0
Yes	I put it last time	0.0
Were all making the same pictures	This straight edge is really helping	0.0
51	8 and 1	3.0
5 7	Theres a new rule	0.0
Did you talk to Liz about what happens when youre multiplying by zero	No	0.0
No	Yes you did	0.0
All right Liz can you tell Louis again what happens when you multiply by zero	When you multiply by zero its still zero because youre	3.0
When you multiply by zero its still zero because youre	Wait do I leave this one zero	3.0
Before you start plotting them though I want you to make a conjecture which is a prediction based on what you know about math about what will the new sailboat look like	I think itll be way bigger	3.0
I hear you say three size and Holly is saying two times the size	Wait will the sailboat look the same	3.0
I dont know	It might be the same or it might be a differentlooking one	3.0
It might be the same or it might be a differentlooking one	It should look the same	3.0
It should look the same	I think it might be the same	3.0
Why do you think it will be double	Because no one cares and it doesnt matter	0.0
If youre doubling the value of the points Interesting	That times two	3.0
How are you girls here	Im finished	0.0
Before you plot the points I want you to make a conjecture or a prediction  math what do you think the new sailboat will look like	Bigger	3.0
What do you know What about your math background knowledge makes you think itll look like a yacht	I think not like a yacht like a bigger boat that you dont really need one of these for	3.0
A sail	Kind of like  like a surfboard with a sail on it	3.0
Do you think that doubling the points will change the shape of the boat	Yes	0.0
What do you know about math	Mine will look nothing like yours	2.0
Where is your new sailboat	I finished that sailboat	0.0
What did you find out	Its the same thing just bigger	3.0
Just bigger but how much bigger	Two times bigger	3.0
How do you know its two times bigger	Because we multiplied the coordinates two times	4.0
How will it look different	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	I just know its going to look different because its not changing the coordinates a lot differently because its not multiplying both making it look the same	4.0
I just know its going to look different because its not changing the coordinates a lot differently because its not multiplying both making it look the same	Its going to look different because youre multiplying one part	4.0
Because only one part of the coordinates is being multiplied its not going to maybe retain this in shape but look a little more different	Yes	0.0
Yes	Then some part of it will	0.0
Do you think it will get taller or wider in that boat in that new shape	Probably taller because most of the  but only the first one got bigger	3.0
Probably taller because most of the  but only the first one got bigger	No then that means it will be wider because thats the xaxis	1.0
When we changed when we make the xaxis bigger	Its wider	3.0
Do you want to work on new sailboat one or do you want to jump in where Liz and Louis are and work on a new sailboat	Where they are	0.0
Why do you agree	It goes to zero because it doubles the zero zero	4.0
You cant say its because shes smart	How do you double zero	2.0
How do you double zero	Because it makes more sense	0.0
I want you to go ahead and graph that new sailboat and then well see if it really does look	You only double the	3.0
Okay	Im not supposed to double zero right	3.0
Can zero be doubled	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
What are you starting to notice about the sailboat	Its looking the exact same but just really big	3.0
How much bigger	Big	3.0
Big	Wait times two bigger	3.0
What makes	Because we have to multiply this by  and	4.0
When you look at the  that the scale gets bigger by looking at the numbers	Oh it is on but you shouldnt be doing it	0.0
Oh it is on but you shouldnt be doing it	Thats not helping them	0.0
Thats not helping them	It is wider	3.0
How much wider is it	Two times wider	3.0
How do you know it was two times wider	Because we multiplied the first number by two and thats the xaxis	4.0
Okay did anything change on the yaxis	No because	0.0
What do you think is going to happen in  sailboat number three	Taller	3.0
Why do you say taller	Because its the yaxis and if youre going to multiply that its going to get taller	4.0
How much taller	Two times taller	3.0
Are you looking Is the coordinate that you want to plot 02	Yes	0.0
Then on the yaxis	Yes	0.0
I know we didnt get to do all the sailboats	Im almost there	0.0
When might someone have to do this in real life	It would be a reallife map and if youre  and you have to change places to go	3.0
Youre going to play the game	Is this right	0.0
All right were going to wrap up in just a minute but what are your thoughts on the new sailboat that you built	I am not smart	0.0
Yes you did all aspects of it doubled by two	Yes	0.0
Yes	What are you doing	0.0
Think about whether it matches your background and what you know about subtracting fractions or subtraction in general	I dont understand	2.0
I dont understand	Wait can you solve it	0.0
Tell me why you think this is my favorite mistake that I saw in the exit tickets	Ms	0.0
Ms	Do we even have to solve the whole thing to find it	0.0
Do we even have to solve the whole thing to find it	I already found it	0.0
I already found it	I found it	0.0
Yes you might not need to solve the whole problem to find my mistake	I already found it	0.0
I already found it	Someone stole my marker a minute ago	0.0
Did you try that one	No	0.0
I think some of your classmates are still looking for the mistake so can we give them another	This one dont work	0.0
This one dont work	Lets go	0.0
Ellis	This one	0.0
Paula	A mistake that you made is when you were subtracting 8 and 18 24 subtracting 5 and 24	3.0
A mistake that you made is when you were subtracting 8 and 18 24 subtracting 5 and 24	You cannot subtract 18 from 20	3.0
Someone at Maggies table	You cant subtract 20 from 18	3.0
Miguel	Then youre going to get	0.0
Were not going to go there right now but	You cant do that in fractions can you	3.0
Why do you think that so many kids rhere were probably five kids showed this work on their exit ticket	They just werent thinking about it at the time	3.0
Jeremiah why do you think so many kids showed that work on their exit ticket	Because they werent doing the work they were just doing what they know from normal subtraction which is 18  20 is 2	4.0
What did these students need to do Gabby	They need  8 into a 7 and then 18  24 which is 42	1.0
Eileen	You have to add 24 to 18 which you would get 42	4.0
Now you just told me that 24  18 equals what	42	3.0
Now do I have enough to subtract	Yes	0.0
This is 2 and	2224	3.0
Whats another way of saying that Lindsay	2 and 1112	3.0
Did we talk about reducing or simplifying in 4th grade	Yes like the  class we would get  if we didnt simplify or we were supposed to simplify	3.0
Yes like the  class we would get  if we didnt simplify or we were supposed to simplify	I dont remember doing that	0.0
Do you know what it means to simplify or reduce a fraction	Reduce a fraction I might know	0.0
Tell me what that means	I know youre doing this earlier on TTM and I got most of your  correct	0.0
Do you know what it means to reduce or simplify a fraction	Kind of like this like if the numerator on this was 12 then this would be 6	4.0
Feel free to talk to classmates at your table spot partners as youre drawing your picture	I already  figured it out	0.0
Tell me how you figured it out already	Because 13 of 24 is 8 and then 23 is 16 because 3 x 8 is 24	4.0
Ms Rossi I heard someone say Im doing this on TTM right now so you might have peers that have background knowledge about these kinds of problems	Do we have to draw a picture though	0.0
Thats one way that mathematicians communicate	I dont know	0.0
Mr McCourt did what	He bought a case	0.0
How much juice was there	13	3.0
Lindsay where did you start	I started out by making 24 boxes of juice 24 boxes in the case	3.0
Did you boxes look It looks like it It kind of looks like a grid like this	Yes	0.0
Then I see youve got four columns and six rows	Yes	0.0
Did you find that using addition helped you solve the problem	Yes	0.0
Did you use anything other than adding fractions to help you though	Not really	0.0
Yes	What I did was I just found out what 13 of 24 is and then what 23 of 24 is and I got 8 and 16	4.0
You found out what 13 of 24 and what 23 of 24 is	That adds up to 24	3.0
You found when you were just working with numbers	I think that theres 16 boxes of one flavor and then 8 of the other	3.0
Lindsay or  tell me a little bit more about what you did next with the pictures	Then I split in into 6 so 16 26 36 46 56 66 and I know that 26 is equal to 13 so I know that those would be grapes which meant there are 8 grapes	4.0
Then I split in into 6 so 16 26 36 46 56 66 and I know that 26 is equal to 13 so I know that those would be grapes which meant there are 8 grapes	Then I know that 46 is 23 so I covered the rest of those and got 16 cranberries	4.0
Then I know that 46 is 23 so I covered the rest of those and got 16 cranberries	4 8 12 16 yes	4.0
I want to hear from someone else who used a picture to solve the problem but maybe their picture looked a little different from Lindsays	I kind of had a picture but I just basic I mostly had arrows	3.0
Maggie tell me what you did	I put them in  and I found out that 38 equals 24	4.0
I put them in  and I found out that 38 equals 24	I put 8 right here because that needs to be equal to 13 and 16 here because 8  8  16	4.0
Yes	She drew the fraction and then the 8 and 16	1.0
What does she know about 8 and 16 as they relate to 24	Very little	0.0
I would argue she knows a lot because she got the problem right and she modeled it in a way that we can understand	Maybe she knows that 8 x 2 is 16	1.0
Maybe she knows that 8 x 2 is 16	Since 13 x 2 is 23 8 x 2 would equal Would 16 be equal to 23 because its the same as 13 and 18 just times 2	4.0
Paula	7	3.0
Rachel	35	3.0
what do you think	Five fives	3.0
Tell me why you think that	Because if you skip count by fives you can reach 35	4.0
Who can add on to that because I know if I skip count by sevens I can also get to 35	Because 5 x 7 is 35	4.0
I just want to hear why you think so	You should cut it into fives because it says what is 35 of 35	4.0
Go ahead and cut your bar into five equalish pieces	I have an answer	0.0
What is each one of these worth	7	3.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
Grant why do you agree	Because 7 x 5 if it equals 35 then we can easily do 3 x 7	4.0
Did we solve the problem	No	0.0
No	Not fully	0.0
Why not yet	Because you dont have You didnt write on the board what 35 of 35 is	4.0
I didnt write on the board what 35	You havent counted to 35	3.0
You havent counted to 35	You need to put	0.0
You need to put	skip counting by sevens in the column in the rows underneath so 7 14 21 28 35	4.0
Im going to draw what Maggie did because its kind of cool	You still need to find an answer	1.0
How many of those five parts do we need to put together	Three	3.0
No what is 35 of 35	21	3.0
Eileen whats your question	Its not really a question	0.0
Its not really a question	Its another way that you could solve it	0.0
Tell me another way I could solve it	Another way you could solve it is figuring out that 7 x 5  35 or doing 355 which equals 7	4.0
Another way you could solve it is figuring out that 7 x 5  35 or doing 355 which equals 7	Then you can do 7 x 3 which would equal 21	4.0

Am I missing a remote	6	3.0
6	6 yes	1.0
What do you know about this problem Paula	I know that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	3.0
Paula say it nice and loud and proud	I said that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	3.0
I said that one dozen equals 12 and two dozen equals 24	She said I said one dozen equals 12 and two dozen is 24	1.0
I dont have any right now so get a pencil for it	Split into fourths because 6 x 4  4	4.0
Show me what your tape diagram looks like	I mean 6  4  24	4.0
I mean 6  4  24	and 12  12 is 24 so that means that 12 roses are white and the other 12 roses are red	4.0
I know this	I respectfully disagree with her because were doing fourths not halves and its 34 of red roses	1.0
I respectfully disagree with her because were doing fourths not halves and its 34 of red roses	Were trying to figure out what 14 is equal to	3.0
What do you notice about what  diagram	Its in fourths	3.0
Ms Rossi All right talk to me about tape diagrams	I figured it out	0.0
I figured it out	4 is a multiple of 24 right	3.0
4 is a multiple of 24 right	We want to know how many since 34 roses are red so	3.0
Lets see if it matches	24 so	3.0
How many of the roses were red	How many white roses are there	2.0
34	Yes	0.0
Yes	How many are red	2.0
How can you find how many are white	It looks like I got it right	0.0
It looks like I got it right	I dont know red or white	0.0
I dont know red or white	16 red	3.0
Here	Wait 18	3.0
The rest how many are left	Think outside the box	0.0
Paula will you come up and draw your tape diagram	It is fair	0.0
It looks like you used a different strategy	Its an easier strategy	0.0
Its an easier strategy	I can share the easier strategy with the class	0.0
Whats the same about them	Theres 13 and theres 12	4.0
Theres 13 and theres 12	Its the exact same like 6 6	4.0
Its the exact same like 6 6	That equals 24 and then	4.0
All right if you dont	tape	0.0
Eileens going to tell us what she sees in Paulas tape diagram	What I see in Paulas tape diagram is that she figured out that she should split the diagram into fourths	1.0
How many pieces did Paula split the tape diagram into	Four	3.0
How many pieces	Four	3.0
Jeremiah whyd she split it into fourths	Because 24 is equal to 4 because it goes up like 4 8 12 then 16 then	4.0
8 16 24 by twos 2 4 6 8 10 12	Or 6	3.0
Rachel	Because 34 on the bottom the denominator is four	3.0
All right Eileen tell us more about what Paula did	Since its split into four she divided 24 by 4 and noticed that it was 6 for the answer	1.0
Since its split into four she divided 24 by 4 and noticed that it was 6 for the answer	244 which would equal 244 which equals 6 so she put 6 in each box so she knows that each fourth equals 6	1.0
244 which would equal 244 which equals 6 so she put 6 in each box so she knows that each fourth equals 6	Underneath each box she put Underneath the first box she put 6 and since 6 x 2  12 she put that underneath the second one and since 6 x 3  18 she put that underneath the third box and she put 24 underneath the last box because that is the whole number	1.0
How could you use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer Eileen	You could use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer because since we know 34 of the roses are red we could use the third box the third number underneath the third box to help us figure out that 34 of the roses are red	1.0
You could use Paulas tape diagram to help you find the answer because since we know 34 of the roses are red we could use the third box the third number underneath the third box to help us figure out that 34 of the roses are red	We could use 18 since its underneath the third box as a representation that 18 is 34 of the roses	4.0

Whats something that you could draw strategy that weve learned just today	Tape diagram	3.0
If youre stuck and this is a little bit confusing this problem what could you do	I	0.0
All right Maggie I see you drew your tape diagram and you split it into how many parts	Three	3.0
Whyd you split it into three	Because three is the denominator	4.0
Ms Rossi Rachels feeling ready	Yes	0.0
I see youve started your tape diagram	I dont know which one like what I can actually	0.0
Whats the whole	I have to do fractions and decimals	3.0
I have to do fractions and decimals	These two are probably going to be more easier	0.0
I hear you saying that because 17 is an odd number youre thinking youll have to use a fraction or a decimal	equals 32	3.0

What am I going to do with the remaining two	You could put it into a fraction	3.0
What would you do with the remaining two	You turn it into 23 because 3 and 23 You turn it into this	3.0
You turn it into 23 because 3 and 23 You turn it into this	You split it into 23 because you split each remainder into thirds	4.0
You split it into 23 because you split each remainder into thirds	Boom like that	0.0
Boom like that	Then you make  because I can put in one and turn it into	0.0
What do you think Lindsay	I dont know	0.0

5 and 23 but when I think about related to the fabric how much of the fabric does it represent	13	3.0
If Mr Calis used 13 of the fabric how much would he use	5 and 23	3.0
Use a tape diagram to help you solve what is 13 of each	Thats easy	0.0
Thats easy	I got my answer	0.0

How many slices is this pizza cut into	Two	3.0
What would my numerator be for just this piece	One	3.0
What would my numerator be for just this piece	One	3.0
One if I put them together what do I have	Two	3.0
Two	Four	1.0
Two out of two which equals	Four	3.0
This is the same as two out of two which equals	A whole	3.0
Thats going to be tricky	It probably is	0.0
I might be huh	Yes	0.0
Questions about why we labelled our numerator something or why we labelled our denominator something	How do they come from being	0.0
Question yes	How do they become both two out of two	2.0
How do they become two out of two	Yes	0.0
Thats a good question	Thank you	0.0
Anybody give that one a shot Sophia	Because they are like if you put them together it will be like  and then that because that one whole is one whole	4.0
Somebody else want to give Jeremiah an explanation why those two pieces when we put them together equals two out of two	Its because if you equal both of them like the bottom and the top it will be whole it will be four and two so thats why we dont add the bottom number twice	4.0
If we eat the whole pizza how many slices did we eat	Two	3.0
If we eat the whole pizza how many slices did we eat	Two	3.0
Two	One	1.0
One	The whole thing	1.0
Let me ask you again this pizza right here if we eat the whole thing how many slices did we eat	Two	3.0
We ate two slices which means we ate the whole pizza does that help	Yes	0.0
Lets look whats our next color	Orange	0.0
How many pieces is that cut into	Three	3.0
How many	Three	3.0
Three so whats my denominator going to be	Three because I have three pieces	4.0
Three because I have three pieces	Denominator	0.0
What would my numerator be for each of those pieces	One	3.0
One my pizza is cut into three slices if I eat all of the slices I would eat three out of three I would eat the whole thing right	Yes	0.0
Alright watch this cool thing we are going to bust it open now we have three pieces	Its like a watermelon	0.0
I got rid of that piece over there Im only going to eat these two slices	Its still a lot of pizza	0.0
Thats still quite a bit of pizza right	A lot	0.0
Sarah you think you might know	No	0.0
No Austin	One two	3.0
Do you think its one out of two	Yes I think its one two	3.0
Sorry Austin Ive got people that disagree with you	Two out of three	1.0
Two out of three	Two out of three	1.0
Why this one and not this one	Because	0.0
Adam	Because one half is like one half of it and thats very narrow but if its two thirds and then its two thirds then that means if you take out one it cant be two thirds	4.0
What Adam is saying is if we compare it to one half to the Austin says is one half are those the same	No	0.0
Lets take that piece back over there were going to go backwards	What happens	2.0
Why two thirds why does two thirds work James	Because you ate two out of three slices	4.0
How many slices are in this pizza	Three	3.0
Three how many did we eat	Two	3.0

What do you think	Yes	1.0
Is that five tenths	No	0.0
Is that five tenths	Yes	0.0
Does that look life like it is equivalent to one half	Yes	0.0
Those are all the ones weve looked at	No	0.0
No	We havent looked at all of them	0.0
We said those fractions are equivalent to one half	Yes	0.0
Do you see a connection between these numbers	Yes	0.0
Luke what kind of connections do you see	The numerator is one two three four five	3.0
The numerators we actually have one two three four five	The denominator is carried by twos	3.0
The denominator is carried by twos	Theyre all equivalent to one half	3.0
Yes	They are all like the four is divided by two	3.0
Im trying to understand keep going	Its half of like four	3.0
Youre saying the numerator is half of the denominator	Theyre all equivalent	3.0
Is three half of six	Yes	0.0
Is four half of eight	Yes	0.0
Is five half of 10	Yes	0.0

Does this	Yes	0.0
What did we just make here	Four twelfths	3.0
How many pieces do we have	Four	3.0
Four out of	12	3.0
Luke what do you think	Three	3.0
Does it work	No	0.0
Its not purple	Its because when its theres not enough theres one more than nine	4.0
Its because when its theres not enough theres one more than nine	If it was nine putting together would equal that	4.0
Okay	Does one work	0.0
Does what work	One	3.0
Adam	Dark Blue	0.0
Alright how many pieces in the dark blue	Eight	3.0
How many pieces Andrew	Three	3.0
Do we have nine there	We dont have nine	3.0
Do you agree	Yes	0.0
Now looking for connections just like we had connections between our one half equivalent fractions what do we have going on here	One three four three six twelve	3.0
If I were to divide six by three if I have two three four five six if I have six and Im going to divide it into three pieces how many in each one	Two	3.0
What is it	I think it gives you four because its basically two sixths combined so of each one gives you double amount	4.0
Tessa you watching	Yes	0.0
I have one pizza that Im going to share with three people Im going to cut that pizza into three slices and everybody gets one bite what if they chopped up that pizza for me already and they gave us six slices still three people but now Im going to share six slices how do I know how many slices each persons gonna get	You just need put them like three and three and just give them to each one	3.0
What if the pizza comes and its in 12 slices Piper	Divide by four	3.0
But I want to share it with three people	No divide by three	3.0
If my pizza comes in 10 slices and theres three people is that really easy to share	You will have one leftover which you can cut it	3.0
We know that when we had our circle cut up by 10 we could not make something that was equal to one third because 10 doesnt divide up evenly for three people	Nine is the closest to ten that really confuses me	3.0
Nine slices three people how many pieces	Three	3.0
We said that one third is equivalent to two sixths yes	Yes	0.0
Are you listening	Yes	0.0
Ezra	You can combine it with another three	3.0
Okay so we could add three plus three whats another way	You could multiply it times two	3.0
What can I do to one to get two	Add one	3.0
Tessa	You could just add one	3.0
Do we see any connections from our numerator to our denominator	Yes	0.0
Looking at what I did what do you see	You just need to add it twice like double it	3.0
Yes	One times four	3.0
Three times four	Four	3.0
Lets go back to this one half one half we said was equivalent to fivetenths Im I right	Yes	0.0
What can I multiply one by to get five	By five	3.0
I should see more hands what can I multiply one by to get five Austin	Times five	3.0
Times five what can I multiply two by to get 10	Five	3.0
Times five does it work	Yes	0.0
Is 10 half of 20 so is this equivalent to one half	Yes	0.0
Whatever I do the bottom	Whatever I do to the bottom	0.0
I do to the top	I do to the top	0.0
Whatever I do to the top	Whatever I do to the top	0.0
I do to the bottom	I do to the bottom	0.0
Easy enough right	Yes	0.0
You have two supports you have the rule I just gave you whatever you do the bottom you do to the top and you have your fraction circle so were looking at page 71 Math journal page 71	I have a question	0.0
Whats your question Ezra	Can we start	0.0
Do you see the chart	Yes	0.0
But I get to eat how many	Zero	3.0
Can we make another fraction thats equivalent to nothing	Yes	0.0
What could it be Willow	Zero twelfths	3.0
My pizzas cut into 12 I get nothing	Zero tenths	3.0
Zero tenths	Zero sevenths	1.0
My pizzas cut up into seven slices I get	Zero	3.0
That one works as long as my numerator is what	Zero	3.0
James what one fraction you wrote thats equivalent	Zero hundredth	3.0
Whats the fraction you wrote Austin	Zero seventh	3.0
Easy enough right	Yes	0.0
Right	Yes	0.0
Id say two to three fractions for each one	Well thats easy	0.0
You have your fraction circles and you have the rule I gave you whatever we will do to the bottom	We do to the top	3.0
Then you can go on to imagine	Can we switch it	0.0
Can you switch it up	Yes	0.0
Everybody know what theyre doing	Yes	0.0
Chihara	We did about to compare fractions	3.0
We were comparing fractions	We did about equivalent fractions	3.0
Jade you want to add to it	We were comparing fractions	3.0
What do we use Harley	We use less than greater than	3.0
We have one more option	The equal sign	3.0
Are you ready	Yes	0.0
Which ones bigger	Okay	0.0
Okay	Which ones bigger	0.0
Which ones bigger	Its ones	3.0
Judith what do they have in common	They both have a one	3.0
Ally	They both have a one for the numerator	3.0
If they both have a one for the numerator how many pieces are we getting	One	3.0
The number of pieces doesnt change but the size of our piece change so 13 or 17	13	3.0
Viviana	Because 17 the pieces are smaller and on 13 one piece is bigger than the one piece of 17	4.0
Youre telling me that the slices over here are bigger	No theyre smaller	3.0
But the numbers bigger	The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	4.0
We cut that piece into more pieces for our slices actually got	Smaller	3.0
Does everyone agree that 13 is greater than 17	Yes	1.0
Ready for another one	Yes	0.0
Emmanuel	The dominator is the same number	3.0
The denominator is the same so what does that tell me about my pieces	Thats theyre less in size	3.0
Sonia	Which pieces youre getting	3.0
How many pieces Im getting so in that first fraction 25 how many pieces do I get	Two	3.0
In 55 how many pieces do I get	The whole piece	3.0
The whole thing	Yes	0.0
25 is greater or 55 is greater	55	3.0
How would we read Xavier	25 is greater than	3.0
Josh help him out	Less than 55	3.0
Could we read it backwards	Yes	0.0
Yes if we started over here what would it say	55 are greater than 25	3.0
Oh my goodness	No	0.0
Do we have a common denominator	No	1.0
Harley	The bigger the denominator the smaller the piece	3.0
Sonia	Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	4.0
What do I want to make	A fraction thats equivalent	3.0
Which one should I be multiplying to is it that first one or the second one	The first one	3.0
What do we want to make in common		3.0
Let me ask you a question do you think it matters	No	0.0
What do you want to try	Top	3.0
Were going to change the denominator and we want to have a denominator of	25	3.0
Where are you guys today		3.0
I want to make my denominator what		3.0
If Im starting with five what do I have to do to five to get 25	Multiply	3.0
Multiply	By five	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
Whats my new numerator	Five	3.0
We ask again whats my new numerator	Five	3.0
Five because 1x5 is	Five	3.0
Which ones bigger		3.0
1025	Yes	0.0
Are the size of my slices the same	Yes	0.0
How many pieces do I get here	Five	3.0
How many pieces do I get here		3.0
Where do I get more pieces		3.0
Somebody explain this to me	Because if you had the fractio if you had a pizza and then you had over 25 pieces and then you ate 10 you had more than 525	4.0
Compare 13 to 49	49	0.0
Are my denominators the same	No	0.0
I saw some good strategies dont get me wrong but are pictures always going to be reliable	No	0.0
Lets look at this should I change my first fraction or my second fraction	First	3.0
First	Second	1.0
You want to change this one	Yes	0.0
Yes	Ill change the three	3.0
To a what	A nine	3.0
Lets get a common denominator here	Multiply by three	3.0
Multiplying by three so if I want to make a nine 33 is going to give me nine whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
Whats 13	Three	3.0
Renata which ones bigger	49 because you get the bottom part its the same and youre going to have different slices but at the top you dont get how many pieces so you get four pieces is more than three pieces which is more in 49	4.0
Renata tells me that four is greater than three	If you did it with one of those circles and you did nine for each you will have to color in three for 39 and then for 49 you will have to color four and youre going to get four for 49 and three for 39	4.0
Lets see if we get this same answer here	Probably not	3.0
How did I go from one to four	Times four	3.0
Whatever I do to the top	I do to the bottom	3.0
34 is		3.0
Now Im comparing 412 to 49 if this works 49 should still be bigger right	No	0.0
Let me ask you is 49 bigger than 412	Yes	0.0
Are you sure	Yes	0.0
How do you know	If the denominator is bigger the pieces are smaller	4.0
If the denominator is bigger the pieces are smaller	It has nine so the pieces should be bigger	4.0
Getting the same number of pieces but these pieces are bigger	Yes	0.0
You with me	Yes	0.0
You have the fractions 19 13 110 12 and 16	The smaller the pieces or smaller the fractions	3.0
Whats that little rule I gave you	The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	4.0
Does that help	Yes	0.0
Youre quiet does that mean you have an answer	Yes	0.0
PH whats our smallest fraction	110	3.0
Why	Because its a big denominator so thats a big piece	4.0
Because its a big denominator so thats a big piece	Its no going to be a big piece its going to be a little one	4.0
Its no going to be a big piece its going to be a little one	They do a lot of those	0.0
When we look at our list of fractions theres something in common right	Yes	0.0
What do they have in common	The numerator	3.0
Harley which ones next	19	3.0
Byron	16	3.0
Josh	13	3.0
HH	12	3.0
Jade what were you thinking	Lets say you have a pizza and theyll cut it up to 10 slices and then theyre smaller thats why I put it here	4.0
Lets say you have a pizza and theyll cut it up to 10 slices and then theyre smaller thats why I put it here	12 I thought of a pizza	4.0
Emanuel	I made it like the denominator that was the biggest number to the smallest number	3.0
Was this pretty easy	Yes	0.0
What do you think made it so easy	The one	3.0
We have a numerator in common	If it was two and then three	3.0
Guess what Im going to give you now	Youre going to choose the one way out	0.0
Youre going to choose the one way out		0.0
	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	Easy	0.0
Renata howd you start	I started with 120 because all the denominators are the same number at the bottom and all the numerators numbers at the top is how many pieces you will get so I did 120 first was the smallest	4.0
Did you hear what she said	Yes	0.0
Im getting 5 here 7 1 3 19 pieces so the smallest amount that I could get is what	120	3.0
We talked about our smallest whats our biggest	1920	3.0
Why	Because you have 20 pieces but youll only eat 19 and the others are the ones and 19 is the biggest	4.0
Tenths	Yes	0.0
Eric	The next one would be 320	3.0
Israel	520	3.0
Somebody I havent talked to Eli	720	3.0
Questions	No	0.0
All right here we go 34 110 26 1112 and 52100	Do we put it in order	3.0
Oh my gosh yes I want this in order	Thats hard	3.0
Why is this so hard	None of the numerators are the same and none of the denominators	4.0
So it is 5200something yes	1112	3.0
Xavier	The largest is 1112	3.0
You think the largest is 1112	Yes	0.0
Because	Because almost all the pizzas you just have one more left	4.0
Anybody else think 1112 is the biggest	Me	1.0
Im going to push back on you and Im going to say 34 were eating all but one piece	It splits	3.0
It splits	Thats the second biggest	3.0
Thats the second biggest	Second	3.0
Why is this one bigger than this one	Because theres one more piece left but pieces are bigger	4.0
Can we all agree that 1112 is the biggest fraction	Yes	1.0
We figured out our largest could we figure out our smallest	Edith youre shaking your head over there	0.0
Whats our smallest one	110	3.0
You can pick somebody out if you want	Gene	0.0
Martin what do you think	I think that after 110 its 26	3.0
You think 26	Yes	0.0
Why	Because you only ate two out of six pieces of the pizza	4.0
If you eat 26 is that more or less than half of the pizza	Less	3.0
I ate less than half of the pizza	Its only a third of a pizza	3.0
52100 is really close to 12 right	Yes	0.0
34 is it greater or less than 12	Greater	3.0
So I know its going to go on this side	Yes we got it	0.0
Yes we got it	I got it right too	0.0
Did you get it	Yes	0.0
Yes	I got it	0.0
You guys think youre ready to try some on your own	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Hey Diana thank you for listening and paying attention what do you notice	What I notice is that the denominator is the same but the numerator are not	3.0
Xavier	The numerators are all the same	3.0
My numerators are all the same and Im comparing the size of my denominators and I know the bigger the denominator	The smaller the pieces	3.0
When I get to number three what do I see	Hundreds	3.0
I see hundreds	And tenths	3.0
Could I easily make those 10 denominators into 100 denominators	Yes	0.0
By multiplying by 10 right	Yes	0.0
When you multiply by 10 you add a	Zero	3.0

Do you guys all agree	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes we do	0.0
Yes we do	Its straw	3.0
Why do you say its 300	Tenths	3.0
Tenths	I wrote 1003 you still get a half 1000100 and you say that 3 under the 100	4.0
Grenada	3100	3.0
Do you guys agree its 3100	Yes	1.0
What do I have to do to 20 to get a hundred	I am going to have to times	3.0
Times what	Times five	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
10 x 5 2 x 5 what do I get		3.0
60	Yes	0.0
Now can I turn it into a decimal	Yes	0.0
Whats our decimal	06	3.0
Grenada what did you do	I divided it	4.0
I divided it	Like this one this fraction at the bottom I divided by 2 and the top I also divided by 2 and then I got 610	4.0
12 divided by 2 is	Six	3.0
Ready to try another one	Yes	0.0
Hard one	No	0.0
Isnt he	Does he have a microphone	0.0
Does he have a microphone	Maybe more microphones	0.0
In order to make a fraction what do I have to do	You have a point	3.0
You have to have a denominator of 10 or		3.0
We could go to 100 by multiplying by		3.0
2 times 3 is  and 20 times 3 is  60	They are the same with just a zero	3.0
However when we write this 610 looks like		3.0
60100 looks like		3.0
Yes because if we do this as a picture would we have any whole pieces	No	0.0
Do we have any longs	Yes	0.0
How many	Six	3.0
Do we have any babies	No	0.0
Do I still get the same amount	Yes	0.0
Yes	Its like if you have 35 and times two	4.0
Its like if you have 35 and times two	It would get six	4.0
It would get six	How would you get the tenths for it to get 610	2.0
Say that again	How would you get the six how would you get the twos to make 610	2.0
How did we get 610 here	No	0.0
No	How did you get those twos that are three	2.0
I know my fraction down here is going to be 100 out of how many pieces do I get	Eight	3.0
How many do I get	Eight	3.0
Ariana		3.0

Kyle what is my fraction going to be	14	3.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
Yes Bud	I will say it in a different way 14	3.0
Does that mean the same thing	Yes	0.0
Sonia what does it mean	Its a fraction that has the same amount	3.0
Were looking at that equal part right	Yes	0.0

I agree	Yes	1.0
We agree	Yes	1.0
What do we do	First you have do 1 x 2	3.0
Why are you doing 1 x 2	To get the numerator	3.0
Okay keep going	At the bottom you do 4 x 2	3.0
Because	Because whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom	4.0
1 x 2 is 2 and 4 x 2 is		3.0
If we were to go over to our picture and we were to now make eight slices of pizza did I change how much I colored in	Yes	0.0
Did I change this black part over here	No	0.0
I just made my pieces	Smaller	3.0
Which reminds me the bigger the denominator	The smaller the pizza	3.0
Sonia		3.0
What am I going to multiply one by to get two	Two	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
Is that going to work	No	0.0
Judith	416	3.0
What am I going to multiply my numerator by to get four	Four	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
4 x 4 is		3.0
Does that work	Yes	0.0
Are you remembering this	Yes	0.0
Is that what youre telling me	No	0.0
Lets go	Why do you stop	0.0
Why do you stop	Do you get tired with each one	0.0
I want everybody to come up with at least one	Can you try another one	0.0
Give me an equivalent fraction for 13	26	3.0
Whats another one	3296	3.0
What do you think she multiplied our numerator and denominator by	1 x 32	1.0
Why do you think she multiplied by 32	To get something times Anything by one is the same number	4.0
In order to go from one to 32 she had to multiply by		1.0
Renata	Another one that I have is 128 at the top and 384	3.0
Kai do you have another one	No	0.0
No	I dont know anything about that	0.0
I dont know anything about that	Even if I was Im trying to figure out what the higher number is	0.0
EH what do you think	1664	3.0
What did you multiply by		3.0
Whats another one	515	3.0
What do we multiply by	By five	3.0
What else	217	3.0
Im sorry what	217	3.0
Could we multiply by anything	Yes	0.0
Is there a rule	No	0.0
I have the fraction 13 I want an equivalent fraction that has a denominator of 12	Got it	0.0
Jeremy what are we going to do	I dont know	0.0
Kai what are we going to do	Ive figured it out it takes four threes because First turns into six nine	4.0
Ive figured it out it takes four threes because First turns into six nine	Then it turns into 12 so just make that 1 x 4 and its four	4.0
Did you pick up on the starting	Can I please multiply 3 x 4 which is 12	4.0
Can I please multiply 3 x 4 which is 12	Then putting the 4 x 1 which he got four because	4.0
Because whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Miss Calice because shes so amazing said Whatever you do at the bottom	We do to the top	3.0
Now we have 1 x 4 is	Four	3.0
Youre with me	Yes	0.0
You heard that one	Yes	0.0
5 x 25 is 125	I think I got it	0.0
5 x 5 is		3.0
Something times five is going to give me 100		3.0
I could also think about something like	Skip counting	3.0
5 times what equals 10	Two	3.0
5 x 2 equals 10 so 5 x 20 equals 100	I thought of that	0.0
What	Then I did 20 x 2 I got 40	4.0
Then I did 20 x 2 I got 40	No its 38	1.0
How are you feeling	Good	0.0
Youre remembering something	Okay	0.0
Okay	Got it	0.0
Martin what have you got	I think its 04	3.0
Youre so close Martin	Zero and 40	3.0
Zero and 40	You add a zero here	3.0
Is 410 equivalent to 40100	Yes	0.0
Was Martin super wrong	No	1.0
He gave us an equivalent decimal	He was super close	1.0
He was super close he just needed that extra	Zero	3.0
Judith	26	3.0
Aaron	56	3.0
Do you agree with that	Yes	1.0
Israel whatd you do	Because if you add 3  2 is five and the denominators are the same so you just add 3  5  5 and 56	4.0
what do you think	Because theyre all the same	4.0
Does that have anything to do with how many slices I ate	No	0.0
No thats just telling me the size of the slice that I ate really not telling me how many right	The number never changed or theres nothing else to add there because its the same thing and theyre not two different numbers theyre just one just showing the others theyre basically a mirror just the top of the mirror is not the same	4.0
The second time I go how many do I get	Three	3.0
The size of my pizza didnt change the shape of my pizza didnt change	Its how many	3.0
You want to try some more	Sure	0.0
Sure	I think shes going to do the opposite of what she did now	3.0
All right lets stick with six lets stick with the denominator of six	Lets do the	0.0
46  36	Thought we did that to all denominators	3.0
You did yes but did I ever teach you any of that	No	0.0
Renata tell me your answer and walk me through it	My answer is one whole and 16 equals It went over number six and you got one whole and then there was no  for this one so its 16	4.0
EH	We just add those two but since it makes a whole youre grabbing another slice	4.0
When we added these two what did we get	Seven	3.0
Do we have to do anything to our denominator	No	0.0
Did I ask you to go that far	No	0.0
She added her numerators one plus five is	Six	3.0
Raise your hand if you got this answer	Should have picked me	0.0
All right youre ready for something a little more challenging	Yes	0.0
All right lets say for Avorys dress I need 1 and 23 of yard of fabric	Can I go to the bathroom to get some water	0.0
That accurately represent what I want	Yes	0.0
How many whole yards do I already have	You have two	3.0
Look at this if I were to just add these wholes what do I get	Two	3.0
Can I add two thirds plus one third	Yes	0.0
Yes	That makes a whole another	3.0
That makes us three thirds or	A whole	3.0
How many yards do I need	Three	3.0

What did we get	57	3.0
Does everybody agree	Yes	1.0
Do I need to do anything to my denominators	No	0.0
How do I feel	Kind of easy	0.0
Do we feel like we need more practice	No	0.0
You want a hard	No	0.0
Above and beyond what you need for todays math work	I want to see what happens	0.0
Whats different	The denominators are not the same	3.0
What did I tell you we have to have in order to add	You have to do the same to the bottom and the top	3.0
We want to have the denominators the same in order to add because if the denominators match we know all we have to do is add the numerators right	I have an answer	0.0
What is it	Times five	3.0
If I can change this to denominator 10 will I be able to add	Yes	0.0
In order to change this to a 10 I have to	Multiply by two	3.0
Multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
12 is	Two	3.0
Now can I add	Yes	0.0
What do I get	410	3.0
The work that you need to do today	Is on	0.0
You dont have to do any changing of denominators and there are no whole numbers	What page is it	0.0
Are we ready	Yes	0.0
Ali what does it say	It says Use fraction circle pieces the red circle is the whole	0.0
It says Use fraction circle pieces the red circle is the whole	Make two different combinations of fractions that the pieces that form one	0.0
Make two different combinations of fractions that the pieces that form one	Get each combination write in fraction or addition	0.0
Eli do you want to start with something like what kind of fractions you want to add	Onetwo	3.0

Did we make a whole circle	Yes	0.0
We have one half right	Yes	0.0
Following me	Yes	0.0
Could I write any number sentence using these fractions	Yes	0.0
Martin we use our model what does that equal	Three fours	3.0
Haley what do you think	I think it equals one whole	3.0
Why do you think it equals one whole	Because the two fours and one equals to two	4.0
One half	One half	3.0
One half	They both cover one piece of the whole one side of the whole	3.0
Thats what you did to prove it	Sure	0.0
Do you think it equals one whole	Yes	0.0
Did I cover if I were to look at this do they cover the whole thing	Yes	0.0
If we were talking pizza if half of the pizza and went back and got a fourth and then another fourth did I eventually eat the whole pizza	Yes	0.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	Add it to the top	3.0
Do we agree	Yes	1.0
What kind of fraction could we cover that with	Eighth	3.0
How many eighths do you want to use Jahaira	Four	3.0
Jahaira says four eighths	If you put them on top the circles and	3.0
If you put them on top the circles and	If you put the other one	3.0
Ill show you something different I dont know why it wont let us add a six	Three	3.0
Three	10	1.0
Are these tests	Yes	0.0
Yes	We need a whole	3.0
What fraction were those pieces	One threes	0.0
Let me ask you is this statement true four eighths plus five tenths equals one whole	Yes	0.0
Do you agree with that	Yes	1.0
Does my picture prove it	Id say if you put in on top of the circle it wont make a whole because its	3.0
What do you think Judith	48 is the same as 12	3.0
Do you agree with that	Yes	1.0
4   4 is	One	3.0
8   4 is	Two	3.0
Do you agree that five tenths is the same as one half	Yes	0.0

Equals	Whole	3.0
You dont get the what	The bottom part	2.0
Youre going to working on the sheets	Byebye journal	0.0
You have to say Yes Emmanuel or do you have to say No its not going to work	Does she have to be in that land	0.0
What do you think from the question	Yes	0.0
Yes	her house	0.0
No she says that she wants to divide it among her three daughters so shes not included in the division of the land	She wont have anymore land	0.0
Think of the way to use fractions to divide the land	Whats a diagram again	2.0
Sonia	Its somewhere where it tells you where it say  almost like a diagram  where it shows you where the nose or the  something where it is	3.0
If were drawing a diagram of the land we might have a picture of the land and slice it up depending on who get which piece	Can we put names	3.0
Can we put names	Can we give the daughters name because I want to show which ones which	3.0
That will work	Okay	0.0
Okay go ahead	Is she a queen	0.0
Yes shes a queen	Okay I hate this	0.0
Ali why do you say no	Because the oldest daughter gets like half the land then the third daughter will get like a a third the other one will get 110 of the land	4.0
Why do you say that	Because if its in thirds it has some in the middle like on the bottom  theyll only get a little piece	4.0
Because if its in thirds it has some in the middle like on the bottom  theyll only get a little piece	But its a half	1.0
Ali say it again	12 would take up half of the 13	3.0
This is supposed to be her piece of the land but half of it is getting given to the older sister	Its not going to be even	4.0
Its not going to be even	Because if they are three and one of them is supposed to get half of it and one of them is supposed to get a whole of 13 then the other one is supposed to get another one but it cant be even she cant do that	4.0
Yes Renada	I proved it because it is bigger than  because 12  13  13 does not equal a whole	4.0
What does it equal	It equals more than full and it equals	3.0
In order to add my fractions together which one do you choose	denominator to another number	3.0
What do I need to do to two to turn it into six Emanuel	You need to add 13	3.0
2 x 3 is	Six	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Whats our numerator	Three	3.0
We are going to multiply by two whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
Whats my numerator going to be	Three	3.0
Renada	Seven	3.0
Seven	76	3.0
Is that figure then a whole	Yes	0.0
Actually can Queen Ann split her land that way	No	0.0
And the oldest daughter she wants to get more than what the other two daughters have	She can	3.0
What are the fractions	This	0.0
How much does each one get	Daughter one	3.0
Do you feel like you need to talk about it	Yes	0.0
Jade tell me how you did this or whats your thoughts	How I did it is basically I did 12  28  24 because the oldest should have like in this part and then the youngest one can have the green part	4.0
You took the yellow part and you just had one yellow part Jade	No I had two	3.0
Okay look at this if I have two yellow parts	But then we had a pink and  the youngest gave two of the blues on top of the yellow	4.0
Jahaira says she has another way Jahaira what did you do	How I did it was I know that the queen is going to get a half and then from the dark blue I got four because I know that the two little girls are supposed to get 13 from the smallest one and the bigger has to get two because they are going to be the bigger	4.0
You said	One for the  the other for the other little girl and then two for the big girls	3.0
Are they equivalent	Yes	0.0
Emanuel	The girls did actually get 23 but  said in 12	3.0
So the queen got 12 queen has 12 and then	24	3.0
How many sisters are there	Three	3.0
You got confused on the queen part	Are we supposed to be doing on the	0.0
Okay did you come up with this you were able to divide it up like this	Yes	0.0
Hold on one second to that did you have a hard time coming up with this	No	0.0
Yes	We didnt know how big the total  should get because maybe they are not even	3.0
Because why say that again	Because we didnt know if the girls could share one but we can see that the smallest ones can bring a lot of space for the two girls	4.0
What fractions are we adding here what is my fraction equation that you wrote Caleb	12  14  18  18	4.0
Im waiting for you guys	Two four six eight 10 12	4.0
Okay stop lets list our multiples of four	Four eight 12 16	4.0
Stop lets test our multiples of eight	Eight 16 24	4.0
What is the lowest number they have in common	They all have eight	3.0
Two times	Four	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
I do to the top	One times eight	3.0
What do I need to do to four to make it eight	2 x 2	3.0
Whatever I do the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
Eight eighths which is the same as one half did we prove it	Yes	0.0
How do you feel	Good	0.0
Do you think Queen Ann is going to be happy about your suggestion	Yes	0.0
Do you think so	She gets more than	3.0
What else is true	You have a 10 but you have also 100 you have to change the 10 to be 100 it cant be in	3.0
What did we have to do	Add the top so you	3.0
Yes so Viviana do we only add the numerator	Yes	0.0
Yes you want to add something to that	Change the denominator	3.0
Do you think these two things apply to subtracting fractions as well	Possibly	0.0
Do you think we have to have the same denominator	Possibly	0.0
Eva What do you think	Five	3.0
Give me a complete sentence	Theres 58 of the pizzas left	3.0
Its true for subtraction also	They do	3.0
We didnt add them this time we did what	We subtracted	3.0
Kaylee	The denominator is going to be 12 because of the other denominators	4.0
The denominator is going to be 12 because of the other denominators	Five take away two is three	4.0
Kaylee says our denominator stays the same so we keep our 12 and we just look at five minus two and get	Three	3.0
Did you get it	Yes	0.0
Jade walk us through it	The answer is 4500 feet if you do if you subtract 67 from 22 its 45	4.0
Okay what about our denominators	The denominators are the same	3.0
Sorry I should have had this ready	What time does it say it is	0.0
I think our internet is moving as slow as we are today	Then we might have to do it on paper	0.0
Then we might have to do it on paper	In computer most of us had hard time getting into Exclusive	0.0
Eli walk me through it	The answer is 28	3.0
Whatd you do	I took 78 and then minus 58 and then I subtracted 75	4.0
You got	28	3.0

Keith what did you do	What I did is since 110 isnt the same denominator as a hundred I can multiply by 10	4.0
Say that again	Because 10 isnt the same denominator as a hundred so I had to make that all the same thing in order to	4.0
Did you pick up what hes saying	Yes	0.0
Hailey	Now you use	0.0
Now you use	The denominators has to be the same so you just put a hundred as the denominator then you add 10  25 and 0  5  5 1  2  3	4.0
The denominators has to be the same so you just put a hundred as the denominator then you add 10  25 and 0  5  5 1  2  3	So 35	4.0
Heres the other answer I got	Because he did it	0.0
How do you think people came up with 126	They didnt multiply or add the denominator	1.0
They didnt multiply or add the denominator	They did not	1.0
What do you think their mistake was Viviana	They didnt make the 110 into ten hundredths	1.0
The number one rule when were adding and subtracting fractions is that what has to be the same	The denominator	3.0
Walk me through it Sonia	You multiply 2  5 to get 10	4.0
You multiply 2  5 to get 10	Then you have	0.0
Am I ready to add now	Yes	0.0
How do we feel about that	Yes	1.0
Should I show you what the other	Yes	0.0
Yes	Is it a hundred	3.0
Is it a hundred	It does equal to that	3.0
It does equal to that	But did he get	1.0
But did he get	But does that still count	1.0
Is it equal to 12	Yes	0.0
Yes	I guess	0.0
Is it equal to onehalf	Yes	0.0
Equal to 12	Mmhmm	0.0
We know that 5 is half of 10 but we also know that we could divide how many times	No	0.0
Would that give us 12	Mmhmm	0.0
Renata Xavier Hailey Martine Jeremy Josh Viviana Sonia  Judith	You okay	0.0
You okay	Youre okay	0.0
Identify the first thing	We have to get the same denominator	3.0
We have to get the same denominator	Change the denominator	3.0
Change the denominator	Yes	1.0
Do they match	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	You have to change one of them	3.0
Caleb what would you change	I would change 13	3.0
Why would you change 13	Because if you multiply 3  3  9	4.0
Because you know that 3  3 is going to give you	Whatever we do to the top we do to the bottom	3.0
Kai	It would be 1  3 is 3	4.0
It would be 1  3 is 3	There would be a three where the one was and also a nine where the three was	4.0

Are we done	Yes	0.0
Pretty easy huh	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Yes	1.0
Ready	Mmhmm	0.0
Are you sure	Mmhmm	0.0
Talk with your table about what youre going to do	Because the denominators are not	3.0
Because the denominators are not	So first Im going to start multiplying 4  3 to make it  and then times three	4.0
So first Im going to start multiplying 4  3 to make it  and then times three	Ill have 3  3  times 3 then 6  and then the answer	4.0
Once you think you have a game plan go ahead and go	Six times three Oh do you put a 12	3.0
Ally whats my first step	You multiply your numerator and denominator	3.0
Why	So you can get	0.0
Xavier	First you have to have similar denominators for those two	3.0
Right	Mmhmm	0.0
Josh	Three times four	3.0
Three times four	Three times three	3.0
Is that all of you	No	0.0
No	You have to do it on the top	3.0
You have to do it on the top	No	0.0
No	You also do it to the top	3.0
What is my new numerator	Six	3.0
Now what Israel	We have 6  1  7 and	4.0
Renata what makes it tricky	I think trying to figure out what times four because we usually do the half of the denominator	4.0
When our denominators get tricky making that change	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Yes	1.0
Really are there a lot of steps though	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Do you want to try another one	Mmhmm	0.0
Talk  table	The denominators arent the same	3.0
The denominators arent the same	I multiplied 3  2 which is 6 and then I did 3  1 which is 3 and then I added then I got 56 and its probably not even	4.0
Do you think we have some answers	No	0.0
No	It is the same thing	3.0
It is the same thing	Sure	1.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Eli	I did 3  2 which is 6	4.0
Why did you change this fraction	Because its not the same denominator	4.0
So youre making your denominator	Balanced	3.0
Balanced	Then I did 33	4.0
Then I did 33	I did 3 1  3  3	4.0
Okay	25  55 I mean 56	3.0
How did he do	Good	1.0
Good	He did really good	1.0
Raise your hand if you got the same answer	Well I got 46	1.0
Do you see where your mistake is	Yes	0.0
Whats different	Theres a mixed number	3.0
Viviana whats different	Kind of its a mixed number	3.0
Does that change our steps	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Kind of	1.0
Judith how would you change our steps for this	Because you first have to do 1 and 23 as an improper fraction	4.0
Judith says First lets make it improper then lets check our denominators then we can add and possibly we might have to go back to what	Mixed	3.0
Mixed	Mixed	3.0
You think you can do it	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
Lets see what you can do	Im pretty sure I know how to Im going to plus make it improper	3.0
Im pretty sure I know how to Im going to plus make it improper	You just done it	1.0
You just done it	No	1.0
No	Im not even  add those	3.0
What did he do to add them	What did you do	2.0
What did you do	I remember you	0.0
I remember you	I add	3.0
I add	To improper you have to  2  2	3.0
To improper you have to  2  2	I know	1.0
I know	53  16 so that 3  2 is 6 and then 5  2 is 10 so you have 16	4.0
We decided our first step should be to make it	Improper	3.0
Right	Yes	0.0
One times three is	Three	3.0
Plus two is	Five	3.0
Right	Technically it does	3.0
Do our denominators match	No	0.0
So what do we need to do	Times two	3.0
How do we feel about Elis choices here	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Two times five is	Ten	3.0
Ten	the denominator	1.0
Kai	Its improper so you have to put it to proper again	3.0
We still have to add	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Add	0.0
Judith	6  16 is	3.0
6  16 is	I know its a mixed symbol	3.0
Are we done	No	0.0
No	We have to change	3.0
Now we have to go back to	Mixed	3.0
Do I have enough to do two wholes	No	0.0
After seeing it like this was it really that hard	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
Take it one piece at a time	Yes	0.0
What am I going to do Renata	Youre first going to turn them into a mixed number into an improper	3.0
How did you turn the mixed number into an improper fraction	I put  in between them the one and the five and the plus	4.0
I put  in between them the one and the five and the plus	Did one 1  5 and it led me to five then I add 5 5 and then we get we dont change the denominator	4.0
Right	Mmhmm	1.0
Now what	No	0.0
Now what	You do 2  5 and thatll equal 10	4.0
Clara	We have to add 12  6  18 and then we have  improper fraction	4.0
As hard as were making it	No	0.0
Lots of steps	We have to think about it	3.0
Could you know how to do all of the steps	Yes	0.0
Once youve finished this problem youre going to check with me and then you can move on to imagine and get some lessons passed	Can we have this next	0.0
Sounds good	Yes	0.0
Are we ready	Yes	0.0

Yes	When you divide it theyre separated into groups	4.0
She said	When you divide you separate it into groups	4.0
When we think about groups is there another thing where were putting things into groups	Dividing	3.0
Dividing	No	1.0
No	Multiplication	1.0
Were we doing some kind of grouping with fractions too	Yes	0.0
12 divided by 3	Thats the easiest one	0.0
Thats the easiest one	Its easy	0.0
Do you know what 12 divided by 3 is	Yes	0.0
Kai what are you thinking	12 divided by 3 is Let me see	4.0
12 divided by 3 is Let me see	4 3s equals 12 so 3 divided by 12 equals 4	4.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
We can think about the opposite of this 4 x 3	12	3.0
12	You could skip count	3.0
You could skip count	Its kind of hard to remember	0.0
We could subtract 3 until we get to How many 3s did we take out	Four	3.0
I have 12 dots 3 dots in each circle and I ended up making	4 circles with 3 dots in them	3.0
One by knowing the turn around facts in addition	Skip counting	3.0
The sum is a clue that we have to Eli not a good time	Add	3.0
Do we have an answer	Yes	0.0
20 divide by 5 is	4	3.0
You counted by 5	Yes	0.0
Yes	5 and	0.0
Iliana	I figured it out by because I know 5 x 4  20 so I looked at the 20 and then looked at the 5 and I knew it was 20 because its 5 x 4	4.0
Kai	I didnt do the same but this is an example	1.0
I didnt do the same but this is an example	I quoted that in my mind maybe but I added 2 to the 3s because 3  2  5	4.0
I quoted that in my mind maybe but I added 2 to the 3s because 3  2  5	The 5s get added by 2s which is 2 more divided by 2	4.0
Im just not sure how that would help you solve this division problem	I only know it	0.0
I only know it	I just said	0.0
Eli whatd you do	We got	0.0
We got	4 x 5  20 so	4.0
You doublechecked your work by going back and trying the multiplication	Yes	0.0
Yes	What I did was think of 5 x 5 which is 25 and then I just subtracted 5 and got 20	4.0
5 x 5 you used that fact that that was too much so you had to take one group away	Yes	0.0
Jaher what do you have	5	3.0
15 divided 3 equals 5	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Okay how do you know	Because I know that 15 divided by 2 No	4.0
Because I know that 15 divided by 2 No	Because if I did that the opposite way it will still be skip counting and we also get 5  because we put everything  so	4.0
Okay so you were counting up by 3s	Yes	0.0
Yes	I used	0.0
I used	I thought 15 divided by 5 equals 3 so the answer might be 5	4.0
Yes	I know  3 times 5 equals 15 so	4.0
On a scale of one to five one being fairly easy division problem five being hardest division problem youve seen in your life where would you rate this	One	0.0
Do you remember that	Yes	0.0
Like subtraction the number that were breaking into pieces has to be our first number	Yes	0.0
Makes sense	Yes	0.0
15 divided by 3 is 5 15 divided by 5 is	Is three	3.0
Could we say that	Yes	0.0
3 times 5 is 15	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Could we also say	Five times Yes	3.0
Is that true	Yes	0.0
Ready to make this tricky	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
No	Yes	0.0
Yes	Im ready for a challenge	0.0
Instead I want to give you this problem	That one is a	0.0
Whats our answer	5	3.0
Oh I have two different things to	5	3.0
5	5	1.0
5	5 5	1.0
5 5	5 5	1.0
Shes saying Sorry Emanuel its not 50 because	other one  to divide 15 from 3 and weve got 5 but the 0s  think of it if you didnt have the 0s it would still be the same	4.0
other one  to divide 15 from 3 and weve got 5 but the 0s  think of it if you didnt have the 0s it would still be the same	I have	0.0
Okay so you want to take the 0s off	Yes	0.0
ignore them and you end up with 5	Yes	0.0
Okay	because if its a 50 it would be 1005 or 1500	4.0
Okay	3 x 5  15 plus youve got two zeros it equals	4.0
Sonia what did you write down because I think that might help Emmanuel out too	What I did is I got 5 but I also did 30 times 5 equals 150 and  same thing because if you do 3 times 5	4.0
She took  made a turnaround fact with multiplication and said Eli are you watching	Yes	0.0
Does that help	Yes	0.0
Yes	But	0.0
Okay	If you use 5 it would be 5 because if you take one 0 and if you put a 5 there it wouldnt be true because	4.0
If you use 5 it would be 5 because if you take one 0 and if you put a 5 there it wouldnt be true because	150 divided by 30	4.0
Did you talk yourself out of what you were thinking	As long	0.0
Are we good	Yes	0.0
Why this 5 works	Yes	0.0
Can we do repeated subtraction	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Okay	You could but	3.0

How many 30s are	1 2 3 4 5	3.0
1 2 3 4 5	We respectfully disagree with you	1.0
Could you see how they were confused	Yes	0.0
in thinking we should have that zero on the end	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
All right you want to try something else	Yes	0.0
Hold on	harder	0.0
harder	I like a challenge	0.0
All right	It is 50	3.0
Ezra what do you think	Its 50	3.0
You think its 50	Yes	0.0
Because	If you take the two 0s from the 30 and the 50 If you take one 0 from the 50 and the 0 from the 30 and the two 0s from the  youll get 3 x 5  15 and then you add the two 0s back	4.0
Okay so you got rid of these two because they could cancel each other out	No I got rid of that one	4.0
No I got rid of that one	I went to that 30 one	4.0
Okay so you got rid of Sorry you did these two	I got rid of those and I got rid of the two 0s on the 50 in the 500	4.0

Okay so tell us a little bit about what you drew	This  represent how many flowers are there	3.0
Did you guys have something similar	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Why Jaher	Because there is three vases and they want to know that we know that theres four and basically theyre saying how many flowers are in these all and we have to add  times four	4.0
Could we have done four plus four plus four	Yes	0.0
Josh and Jaher both talked about a simpler way multiplication but we know that multiplication is just repeated	Addition	3.0
Some of you might have had the equation of four plus four plus four plus four equals	12	3.0
Are both of those correct	Yes	0.0
Yes	16 plus 16 is	3.0

What answer would I get	58	3.0
Renata what do you think	Well we knew that	0.0
Emmanuel	You have to make just take the 18 and try just add 5	4.0
Okay say it again	If you have 5 just make 5 times 18 add 5 to the 18 youll have 58	4.0
So now what do you think	That since the denominator is going to be the same were technically just multiplying 1 times 5 so you will get 58	4.0
Did you hear what she said	No	0.0
So really when were looking at the addition all were doing is messing with our numerators right Ilik	Yes	0.0

What coordinate is that	The X	3.0
What am I doing with the Y coordinate	Youre just leaving it the same	3.0
Youre just leaving it the same	Youre leaving it as a zero	1.0
Okay mark those or do those	So youre doubling this one or this one	2.0
So youre doubling this one or this one	162	3.0
Original pair	Okay	0.0
That says original so youre always going back to the original	Then itll all be the same because if we double this thatll be that same number	4.0
Yes but are you doing anything to this one	No	0.0
See	Okay	0.0
Whats going to happen to my boat do you think	Its going to become longer	3.0

Okay well you have to wait till your partner is done because Im not sure why youre done and your partner is not	We started at the same time	0.0
Okay read this rule to me	Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	0.0
What is that called	The X coordinate	3.0
What am I doing with the Y coordinate	Leaving it the same	3.0
What do you think is going to happen to my boat now	Its going to become wide	3.0
Are you ready	Yes	0.0
Okay very good	These ones	0.0
Read the second	Double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	0.0
What coordinate am I doubling	The eight	3.0

You remember you told me	16 is it	3.0
No is the	X	3.0
X coordinate and what coordinate is not changing	The one	3.0
Am I right	Yes	0.0
Yes	I dont know	0.0
Nice job Stella now you may graph that one	Can we also connect to that	0.0
Okay Bruce read this rule to me	Rule double the first number of the original pair leave the second number the same	0.0
What coordinate am I doubling	Youre doubling this one this one and this one	3.0
What coordinate is that	The X so now Im going to Y	3.0
What coordinate is the eight	Eight is X	3.0
What coordinate is not	X	3.0
No what did she just say	The Y	3.0
What are we doing with the X coordinate	Were doubling that	3.0
What are we doing with the Y coordinate	The Y coordinate will just be here	3.0
What are we doing with this one	Were doubling the first number and leaving the original number the second number the same	3.0
What coordinate are we doubling	The X	3.0
All right are you ready ladies and gents	Yes	0.0
Okay read this one to me	Double the second number of the original pair leave the first number the same	0.0
What coordinate are we doubling	The Y	3.0
What are we doing with the X	We leave it the same	3.0
What about the original	That too	0.0
Are you ready	I dont know if I did it correctly	0.0
Okay so  162	162 is right there	3.0
Connect 162 to 102	So 102 is right there	3.0
Now youre going to connect 102 to 1014	1014 is right there	3.0
You dont have 1014	I do	3.0
Connect this one to that one	24 is right there	3.0
24 you had it I apologize darling	Its okay	0.0
Okay now connect 24 to 102	102 is right there	3.0
Heres 10 where is 2	Right there	3.0
Zoey make sure that you connect from the dot or its not going to be the right kind of line	Okay	0.0
What coordinate always goes first Chloe	X	3.0
Now go from 102 to 02	02 is down there	3.0
Where is 02 Penny	Right there	3.0
Why is there not a dot on it	I got a little bit stubborn	0.0
Now go 40 to 140	So right here basically	3.0
What are we doing	Doubling like this	3.0
What coordinate is that	Coordinate X	3.0
Okay and what am I doing with the Y coordinates	Youre just leaving it	3.0
Thank you	Do we do this the rest of this	0.0

Why is this not working	Did you press the go	0.0
All right friends these are what type of fractions	Improper	3.0
All right once again what type of fractions are those	Improper fractions	3.0
What are we turning these improper fractions into everyone	Mixed numbers	3.0
All right go ahead Mariah tell us what you did and how you got your answers	Which one of them	0.0
Does anyone remember	32	3.0
Okay go ahead 32	I knew that two went into three one time so that was the whole	4.0
I knew that two went into three one time so that was the whole	Then you have 12 leftover so I did one and 12	4.0
Okay what about the next one	The next one I did I knew that four goes into five one time and then left 15	4.0
Im going to write those fractions down	We could also divide them	3.0
What is this called	A denominator	3.0
This part of the fraction is called the what	Denominator	3.0
What is this part called	Numerator	3.0
Tell us what you did	What I did was that I new 11  8  3	4.0
What I did was that I new 11  8  3	I proved it because 11 can go into three three times so thats the whole number and the remainder of two so I knew that the answer was three and two thirds	4.0
Okay give me that thumbs up if you agree with Clays answer	Everyone	0.0
Im not sure where that right came from so I need some clarification on that	Because the	0.0
My fraction was 113	I took the third minus 11 then I knew that it was eight	4.0
You can get your paper or you can take your whiteboard	This a fraction of 113	4.0
This a fraction of 113	You could take three wholes or you could three out of the 11 three times so that  is nine three wholes and then 11   is nine equals 23 left	4.0
You could take three wholes or you could three out of the 11 three times so that  is nine three wholes and then 11   is nine equals 23 left	Then I got 3 23	4.0
Im looking at three different ways that this was solved and I want them to explain their thinking okay	Well I started dividing these fractions	4.0
Well I started dividing these fractions	I knew three and three make its a whole so I knew three times three is nine so I did write those three wholes and you cant add a  23 left because when you add another three it will be four wholes and that would be over 11	4.0
Did we see a variety of different algorithms up there	Yes	0.0
They were not the same were they	No	0.0
If you get ones what does that tell me	You dont understand	3.0
How do I graph them	You look at the right coordinates	3.0
What coordinate do I have to graph	The Xaxis	3.0
Stella whats our rule	Our rule is always start with the X and then the Y	3.0
Always start with the X what	Coordinate	3.0
Give ya wow thats some great language wasnt it	Yes	0.0
Im going to give you	Extrapolate	3.0
If you look on here my C	It finally works	0.0
Everyone turn your math journals to page 138	Yes	0.0
Yes	I already did that	0.0
What is this	It is a data table	3.0
Do her ordered pairs model whats there	Well some do but one doesnt	3.0
What one does not represent what is there	The three and seven is switched	3.0
Okay what about the Is that the only one that is switched	No eleven and seven	3.0
Is that going to mess up my data when I start graphing that	Yes	0.0
Why	Because its not the right coordinates	4.0
Look at the Roberto if you need to phone a friend Im going to let you phone a friend	Yes	0.0
Okay quickly	Carson	0.0
Carson	The X and Y are going to switch  because you have to start with the X and if you dont start with the right  your coordinate is going to be off by a lot	4.0
Those arent labeled X and Y coordinates so why is it going to mess me up	Well because the first because the numbers rule between two coordinates	4.0
Hudson can you add to Carsons thinking	When youre looking at this you start with the	0.0
Liliths very good	Liliths age because thats the X coordinate if you look on your grid	4.0
Liliths age because thats the X coordinate if you look on your grid	Noahs is the y coordinate so it would be	4.0
Im not talking about the same thing if I reverse it am I	No	0.0
I am going to watch you write their ages as ordered pairs because this didnt say anything about X and Y coordinates did it	No	0.0
Do our data tables always say X and Y coordinates	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
This is a data table right	Yes	0.0
Does that go back to what our learning objective was	Yes	0.0
Yes maam	Do you want us to connect the points	3.0
Do you remember why her data wasnt correct	Theyre not the right coordinates	3.0
Bruce what do you notice	I noticed that its in a straight line going up	3.0
Is it a straight line going up though	Its going diagonal	3.0
Its going diagonally but its going up	Yes	0.0
What are the numbers doing	Theyre increasing	3.0
How old was Noah		3.0
Its not on there is it	No	0.0
Finn your head should be up	I knew it was four	3.0
I knew it was four	She was four years older Noah because	3.0
Go ahead	Liliths age was 12 and if you do 12  8 12  8  4 and so if you do eight minus four that would be four	4.0
Go ahead Hudson	What I did is I looked at the grid and knew that five plus one would be six so five plus two was seven and one plus two was three and then seven plus one was eight so between eight and nine and four is between five and three so itll be four	4.0
Makes sense	Yes	0.0
Because you got it right there	12 minus I noticed a pattern with number four	4.0
12 minus I noticed a pattern with number four	1  4 would equal 5 6  1  7 and then 5  4  9 and then those two just	4.0
Okay	Then when she was six he would be 12	3.0
Coach him through	I got it	0.0
How many years is it going to take him to turn 11	Three years	3.0
How many years did it take for him to turn 11	Three	3.0
How do you know hes going to turn 15	Because 3  12  15	4.0
How many is it going	Five	3.0
Okay so what number is going to be here	Three	3.0
Two three six five does that make sense	No	0.0
Show me how youre going to graph it	I see a pattern	3.0
Is this first number two	No	0.0
This goes up by how many	Two	3.0
What one do you log first	X	3.0
Do it	Thats a point of the grip that shows  recording	0.0
If you finish filling this out can you run and grab your whiteboard please	Yes	0.0
What do you notice about these right here	Two four six eight	3.0
Two four six eight	Two one	1.0
Two one	One two three four	1.0
One two three four	Okay	0.0
Okay	This would be the X	4.0
This would be the X	This ones counting by twos this ones counting by ones	4.0
I want you to think about it in the context of multiplication	I know	0.0
Tell me	Two times two is four	4.0
Two times two is four	Three times two is six and four times two is eight	4.0
What would be my next number here	That would be five and 10	3.0
Does six times two equal 12	6 x 2  12	4.0
6 x 2  12	Yes	0.0
Can that be the right answer if theyre looking for how many laps he ran with to earn 14	No	0.0
What would be the right answer		3.0
12 x 2 is 24	Seven	3.0
Because	7 x 2  14	4.0
What are you doing way over here buddy	I thought it was 14 7	3.0
Is the seven laps run or money earned	I think it s the money earned	3.0
No he told you they earned 14	You just do seven	3.0
Seven and how much money did he earn		3.0
What are the coordinates buddy	7 and 14	3.0
Did you have to make sense of the table	Yes	0.0
Hudson	We made sense of it by	0.0
Russel	looking at the graph	3.0
The data tables	The data table and inter	0.0
Interpreting	Interpreting which Wait	0.0
Interpreting which Wait	Interpreting which	0.0
Did you have to look at the headings	Yes	0.0
Then you had to interpret the	The coordinates	3.0
The rule that was being used in order to write the That was the word	The coordinates	3.0
Would you agree with that	Yes	0.0
Did you have to estimate things	Yes	0.0
You got this one or that one	I get how you said that because thats  but thats how many chapters he had already read	3.0
I get how you said that because thats  but thats how many chapters he had already read	Itd be 10 and a half	3.0
Itd be 10 and a half	I got six and a half	1.0
I got six and a half	I said on day six	1.0
Once you name it 0055 if its asking you to round it to the nearest hundredths	She got the same thing as me	2.0
Its not asking you take it to the nearest thousandths its asking you to the nearest hundredths	The hundredths is the second number right there	3.0
The hundredths is the second number right there	The second number after the decimal	3.0
The second number after the decimal	You should be rounding the seven	1.0
What were the answers that you came up with	Six	3.0
Six	I got seven	1.0
How many chapters a day does she finish	Three three a day	3.0
Six times three is 18 so would it be six or would it be five and a half	I think five and a half	3.0
I think five and a half	Thats what I was thinking there might be a half	1.0
If we were looking for exact but does the question ask us about exact or does it say about	About	3.0
Okay so six days puts us at 18 which is almost there but they gave you the hint down here day three and a half	Yes thats what I was trying to say	0.0
Okay	Three and a half so ten a half	3.0
Three and a half so ten a half	How do you spell the first name	0.0
How do you spell the first name	CARSTON	0.0
CARSTON	Cars TON	0.0
Good job	I could do one if you want me to	0.0
Go ahead	finish it on day seven	3.0
How many chapters does he read a day		3.0
Youre telling me that 500 is a whole number	055	3.0
Thats much better 055	Yes thats what I got	1.0
Okay	For number six I got three and 910	3.0
For number six I got three and 910	What	0.0
What	Wait no 309	3.0
What did you get	I got 397	3.0
Thats why I was curious as to how you guys 09 because what happened to your seven	My seven that was my hundredths	3.0
No but if youre rounding to the nearest hundredths what place value did you look at	The thousandths	3.0
Whats the next one	I got 141	3.0
Everybody enlarge	Enlarge	0.0
Whats my picture on the coordinate grid going to look like	Enlarged	3.0
Its got to get	Bigger	3.0
What is the rule	Something that you have to follow	3.0
What would that rule contain	Like an order	3.0
Could you please sit up like a fifth grader	It means its bigger than that	3.0
Is it greater than 45 x 9 and how do you know	I know that its no because youre minusing 50 so that means its lower like a lower answer	4.0
Georgia what about the second one	I think its a yes because 45 x 9 will give you plus eight	4.0
Okay and Ms Matty give me the last one	I said yes it was greater because whenever youre timesing the number thats bigger than one the number always gets bigger and so then whatever 45 times 9 always got bigger than the answer	4.0
Do you agree with that	Yes	1.0
Georgia do you need to join me at the front table or youve got this babe	Im kind of confused	2.0
Wider is that going to be this way or this way	This way	3.0
If its and I double that it would still be	Zero	3.0
Am I doubling both of them Sarah or one of them	One	3.0
what would that be doubled Helen	Five and	3.0
I want you to look over here	Is it	0.0
Youre giving me four but thats the ycoordinate I think	Is it	3.0
Do you agree with him	Yes	1.0
Explain to me why its one and four	Well because	0.0
If I double that Danni whats it going to be	Well its going to be	3.0
Am I doubling both or just one	Just the one	3.0
Youve already done that on the other page	Can I go back to my desk	0.0
Okay write what the new trape What would the new trapezoid numbers be if Im doubling the X coordinates	Do we need a straight edge	3.0
Call me	Call me Asher	0.0
Does it look the way you expected it to	Not really	0.0
Why	Because I thought it would be taller	3.0
Did you two friends agree	Yes	1.0
Did you determine what one was right and what one was wrong	Okay	0.0
You do your work	Zero zero dont put	3.0
No you may go back and start working on math boxes for the previous unit four lesson	Then do two	3.0
Then do two	then	1.0
then	Okay I see what I messed up now	0.0
Okay I see what I messed up now	Then if I put the letters in RC I see now	3.0
Helen how are we doing	because its wider	3.0
Is it bigger	No its just wider	3.0
Remember	Yes	0.0
There you go	No because the trapezoid its	3.0
What part does it make sense to you	Just how it wouldve	0.0
You understand the concept	Yes I understand	0.0
Its writing the rule	Some of the questions on how to interpret	3.0
Okay so its more of the writing part that doesnt make sense to you its explaining what the rule is	Yes	0.0
Then you would say No it wasnt because the RC if it gets wider does that RC	It doesnt make any sense because its bigger and you cant make it that way because then it would be taller	4.0
What would I have to do to go tall	You have to double those things	3.0
If I doubled this one and it made it wider what do I have to double to make it	to make it taller	3.0
What coordinates am I doubling	All three of them	3.0
This is the X and whats this one	Y	3.0
Explain to the class how you answered this first question	How I answered this first question was I was reading it and she said that she wanted  to fix her drawing she was going to make it wider and not taller so what I said is I think it will be short and wide	4.0
How I answered this first question was I was reading it and she said that she wanted  to fix her drawing she was going to make it wider and not taller so what I said is I think it will be short and wide	I think this because if you dont want the trapezoid to be tall but when you also make it wider it kind of looks small	4.0
What was the rule that she used Jacob	Times every times the number times two	3.0
Times every number times two	No the X coordinate	3.0
The X coordinate times two and your response read that again	I think it would be short but wider	4.0
I think it would be short but wider	I think this because if you dont want the trapezoid to be tall but you dont want it to seem tall so when you  you want it to be wider and it gets wider and it gets smaller at the same time	4.0
Were you specific in answering that question	No	0.0
Turn around and face the class dont look at me	I said I think the trapezoid will look wider	4.0
I said I think the trapezoid will look wider	I think that because shes doubling all the first coordinates	4.0
I think that because shes doubling all the first coordinates	I also think with the letters in the shape are going to get wider	4.0
If Im doubling something how much bigger is it getting	Two	3.0
Do you see how specific they were	Yes	0.0
How many of you were that specific	Thats what I thought	0.0
Just because Im doubling the first one if I dont explain to my person that Im making it twice as wide on that X coordinate its not going to tell my reader what they need to know is it	No	0.0
Let me go back	Go back and theres a next on the bottom	0.0
and see if it	Show prediction	3.0
Okay so the new one should have been in blue but theres my new one	No it says predict	3.0
Rewrite your answer using the speci	Specifics	3.0
Youre doing number four	I think we did that wrong	3.0
Well thats okay I want you to work on thats okay because youll get that one when we get ready to do it	Can we just erase what we wrote	0.0
Okay so you need to make sure your explanation goes with the words that youre using okay	I thought that he was going to	3.0
See you were correct because you said But is it two times bigger	Wider	3.0
Just put a line through bigger and write wider	I think that I mentioned that I got two times wider and maybe it got two times wider	3.0
Youve got to go back to your math book	I thought it was going to be more taller than it is	3.0
What was your misconception	First I kind of ignored the word the first time	3.0
First I kind of ignored the word the first time	Larger	3.0
Larger	I changed larger two times	1.0
I changed larger two times	Sticky notes	0.0
Are you all done talking	Yes	0.0
Did you change your thinking on how you were going to do this	Yes	0.0
If I want to make it not only wider but bigger what do I need to do	Change the Y coordinates	3.0
So my friends this is	Homework	3.0
Flora excuse me what are you doing	Im messing with the marker	0.0
Put it where it belongs please	Okay	0.0
All right table group leaders stand up please	We have three	0.0
Hudson would be best	We have three here	0.0
I dont want a complete sentence do I	No	0.0
Okay give me a sentence starter	Jake can use and then we were thinking Jake can use blank as his rule but thats like a sentence	3.0
Hudson	A rule that Jake can use to make the book larger is to	3.0
Im looking for one word	Jake can make the picture larger by	3.0
How is he going to make it bigger Nivea	You can double	3.0
What is he doubling everybody	The coordinates	3.0
Okay because the book is going to get twice as	Large	3.0
Do you see what your explanation needs to be like	Yes	0.0
A rule Jake can use to make the book larger is to	Double Y and Y coordinates	3.0
That book is going to get	Twice as large	3.0
Or twice as	Tall	3.0
Sarah	Kayla	0.0
I love when they got what I need to take classes  my children are out there alone	I dont think so	0.0
Do you like that	Okay	0.0
You need to get that	I think the book will be wider because you multiply by X	4.0
I think the book will be wider because you multiply by X	Thank you	0.0
Hes writing can you tell me what your answer from question one and two	Two and 10	3.0
Were my direction one person do it the other person copy	No it was always just behind	0.0
I dont know you tell me	I dont think you should draw the book	0.0
If Im looking for a folder art youve got folder art	No	0.0
Why not	Because you choose from one or the other one	4.0
Thinking about your rule what could you have done differently to make an actual folder art	to	3.0
to	Its  to	1.0
Look at this little teeny tiny thing compared to my folder	Okay then  to	3.0
Whats wrong with my rule	You would have to do more than double eight	3.0
Why	Because its just the way it is and thats all	0.0
Because its just the way it is and thats all	Okay now its  to	4.0
Okay now its  to	Multiply it by four that would be 16	4.0
and just do one point and see how big its going to make it	right here and then you go up to  right here and then you go up to  and then you go up to  right there	4.0
Why	Because	0.0
Whats another rule we could have tried	20 so we could do and then it could be all the way up here so it would be	3.0
If you did it by four how big is it though	Wait so yes now we have to go to	3.0
Okay am I getting better	Yes	0.0
Could I have made it bigger than that	Sure	0.0
Sure	Now zero to six so	4.0
Now zero to six so	We try six so we can try	4.0
We try six so we can try	Now  multiply by	4.0
That doesnt make sense right now	Maybe if you add those at certain points	3.0
I see what youre talking so youre talking the actual grid	Yes	0.0
Okay	We could do it by six	3.0
Bam bara bam bam	Bam bam	0.0
Is that good folder art	No	0.0
Is that any better	No	0.0
No	Yes looks like that too	1.0
Theyre all going to look like that because none of you thought to do anything but	Double it	3.0
Does the rule always have to be double	No	0.0
If I want something bigger so Danni you guys did times what	Four	3.0
Do you have one line drawn that I could look at	No we put the points there	3.0
Is that a little bit bigger	Yes	0.0
Could they have gone bigger	Yes	0.0
Yes	Lets do this by 10 now	3.0
When Jake said he was designing a folder the first thing you should have done was pulled the folder out right	Yes	0.0
Then you would have realized well if I double that its only going to be about that much bigger and if I triple it its going to be about that much bigger	Another day we were talking about cartoon size folders	0.0
Theyre on my desk	Tomorrow we dont get homework either right	1.0
Yesterdays success criteria the learning intention is I will develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on a coordinate grid and enlarge meant get	Bigger	3.0
All right Matty give me a term that we used when we were talking about enlarging something	is that something is getting bigger	3.0
Phone a friend	Two times as tall or two times as large	3.0
Kayla what did we create	A diagram	3.0
We had to come up with something before we could create the diagram	A picture	3.0
So think back to yesterday we all created a diagram that we enlarged correct	Yes maam	0.0
Georgia	Usually  is two times as bigger and usually the size of our folders	3.0
Did that necessarily mean that your enlargement was incorrect	No	0.0
Kind of like if Im going to buy pizza for the class Im not going to buy one pizza am I	No	0.0
Clay what does it mean to revise	To restart or change	3.0
Do you guys have four	We only have two	0.0
You dont have a partner	We have four	0.0
We have four	We already have four	0.0
Okay so everybody has a group of at least three people	Yes	0.0
You didnt get it drawn	No	0.0
Did they successfully enlarge it	No	0.0
They followed the rule	Yes	0.0
Franc what did you disagree with what I said	I disagreed with it because when you said	1.0
Did you agree with or disagree with that they used the same coordinates	I disagreed	1.0
Why did you disagree	Because they didnt use the same coordinates otherwise if they did itd be in the	4.0
It would be in the what	The corner	3.0
They actually came up with different coordinates	Its still the same one	1.0
Yes Stella would you like to add something to that	Yes that I think the coordinates are	1.0
Yes that I think the coordinates are	Not when its five and nine	1.0
Not when its five and nine	Thats five and the other one is more than five	1.0
Thats five and the other one is more than five	That theyre different sizes	1.0
Okay so if we go back and look Stella	I think itll go to 10 wouldnt it	3.0
So if our first coordinate was 02 how many spaces are between 0 and 2 on the X coordinate	Two	3.0
Two okay and then if our next coordinate was 20 how many spaces are in between there	Two	3.0
How many squares are in between each	Two	3.0
Six and eight is that two	Yes	0.0
Did they enlarge it	No	0.0
No its the exact same isnt it	Yes	0.0
Could I have changed the coordinates to enlarge the book	Yes	0.0
Would it have been easier or harder	Harder	3.0
Why would it have been harder Finn	What	0.0
What	To do what	2.0
To change the coordinates this way	Because then you have to figure out where it is from zero and two then you have to figure out where youre going to put it on the grid to start it off and then you have to do what you do	4.0
Because then you have to figure out where it is from zero and two then you have to figure out where youre going to put it on the grid to start it off and then you have to do what you do	It says right there you just redraw it then try and redraw it as you can	4.0
Okay so is it easier to create a rule when enlarging something using the original coordinates and just doubling them or tripling them or quadrupling them	Yes	0.0
No youre going to get to think about it	I cant even see	0.0
They asked you to create a rule that enlarged it and this person said	Thats student Bs work	3.0
This is student Bs work right	Yes	0.0
Are we talking about the same thing	No	0.0
All right so new book he multiplied the X coordinate by six so lets look 62		3.0
06	Zero	3.0
Look what he did here	He needed to add the one coordinate to what it was up there	1.0
All hes telling me is that hes multiplying the X coordinate by six and in the second one the original book was 01 and in his it was 06	We can too 01	1.0
Jenn tell me what he did	He said you will only multiply the X coordinate but he did the Y coordinate	1.0
He multiplied that Y coordinate by six didnt he	Yes	1.0
Look at what he did here and did he do it all the way down	Yes	1.0
So his coordinates he did not follow his rule did he	No	1.0
Okay but hes got this book here	Thats huge	0.0
His books doing the work	Its not big enough	3.0
Then hes got 030	All the way up there	0.0
Im not sure hes got a book here doesnt he	Yes	1.0
It looks bigger	Really big	0.0
MIssy explain to me why his book worked	It worked because he doubled the X coordinates and Y coordinates	4.0
Did he double	No	1.0
No	Second guesses	0.0
Im going to ask you to phone a friend in your group to help you continue explaining	He timesed it by six to make it bigger both ways instead of it being taller because he started going too taller but then its a normalsized book because he timesed it by six	4.0
Because he did both it made it taller and	Wider	3.0
Number C or student C it was corrected it taller	He was correct it got taller	1.0
He was correct it got taller	I dont think he understand the problem	1.0
Im going to ask you did you all do anything wrong yesterday	No	0.0
No	No we follow the rules	3.0
No we follow the rules	We made it bigger	3.0
We made it bigger	We followed the rule	1.0
We followed the rule	We followed the rule we just didnt get is as	1.0
Okay so you followed the rule	Yes	0.0
Did you enlarge it	Yes	0.0
Did you meet the objective	Yes	0.0
Now did it fit on a folder or did it look like an ant on that folder	It looked like an ant on that folder	4.0
So if you have a twin bed a number one if you have a double bed a two if you have a queen bed a three if you have a king or California king give me a four	I have number one	0.0

Do I have windows on this side	No	0.0
Do I have as many cabinets on this side	No	0.0
How come I could not Bruce	Because the house number it goes to is four or the coordinates that you have to meet is four so you have to do 410 and thatll be 40 and it doesnt go up to 40	4.0
Okay yes maam	What is wrong with that 127	2.0
Like Stella youre saying we didnt get ours done is what youre telling me right	Yes	0.0
Yes maam	Would we write our new rule on this paper	0.0
No how do we write our new rules	Color	0.0
Youve got the back of the paper okay	Okay	0.0
Youre going to need to move yours too because you cant have it	Me	0.0
Okay you have these out and begin working again	Are we working on the same thing	1.0
Let me see	Because I picked the skin on it	0.0
Remove your fingers and I want you to stop eating your finger	No Im not talking to you	0.0
No Im not talking to you	Im talking to Matty	0.0
Why cant you	Because they	0.0
Take your maths books out and work on some maths for a few minutes okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay so were going to have to multiply by six	4.0
Okay so were going to have to multiply by six	Okay so were going to multiply X and Y	3.0
Okay so were going to multiply X and Y	2x6	3.0
Are you doubling	12 and then 0 and then 0x6 so 0	4.0
I want to see what you did	Okay so 2x612	4.0
Okay so 2x612	Im on	3.0
Im on	No Im on	3.0
No Im on	So zero and then 30	3.0
There you go	No we still do this	3.0
No we still do this	We still do that one because we have to go from that to there so we dont cross that one out	4.0
Youre using a colored pencil so thats okay	Im sure because 6x1 is 6	4.0
Im sure because 6x1 is 6	Yes Im on	3.0
Thank you	Then 6x53	4.0
Then 6x53	No that is there	1.0
No that is there	Sorry I know we have it right there	1.0
Sorry I know we have it right there	We all make mistakes	1.0
X only by five and what do you think the outcome is going to be	Its going to be wider	3.0
Okay Matty good job	Then 0 all the way up to 30 up there and then six	4.0
Where is the six	The down one	3.0
Where would  be	Okay now its	3.0
So why are you putting the Y first	Just skip that one	0.0
Just skip that one	skip that	0.0
You put the Y first then	Skip that	0.0
Skip that	No were supposed to connect them	1.0
Make sure okay	You crawl before you walk or you walk before you climb	3.0
You walk before you climb	Or you crawl before you walk	3.0

Is that really 35	Not exactly	3.0
Because its only half	Its only supposed to be a little bit	3.0
Your design needed to be smaller	Smaller	0.0
Im asking the question did you look at the size here	No	0.0
Should you have listened to what Ricky was saying in the first place when he said you dont have enough	He didnt say that he said that theres no 35 so	1.0
Only do it six times instead	Do I have to do that	0.0
As soon as he said we dont have a 35 what should you have said	Its too big	3.0
All right get those ready to carry on even though you didnt have them	It will be bigger and taller	3.0
Marcuss going to share out what happened and how his thinking should have changed go	Okay well so I did seven times the Ycoordinate while I only did six for the X because if you did seven for the X then itd be really too large	4.0
Okay well so I did seven times the Ycoordinate while I only did six for the X because if you did seven for the X then itd be really too large	So I did seven for the Y and found out that it was only half of the square	4.0
Can I borrow this to show them	Yes it was only half a square	3.0
This wasnt a full square up here was it	No	1.0
Ricky what did you say the second he said that	I said that theres no 35	1.0
I asked Marcus now what should that have triggered everyone	That we needed to make it smaller	3.0

Because we want to hear their thinking and we want to think to ourselves did we solve the same way or a different way and are their answers reasonable	For the first one we did 1214 and we got 34	4.0
For the first one we did 1214 and we got 34	Can we show how we did it	0.0
Why dont you pick one to explain how you did it rather than all four	1214 we knew that 12 equals 24 and then 241434	4.0
Would you share with us the other answers that you got and we can see if we agree	34 48 78 and 34	3.0
Would you call on someone please	Maybe for the 48 howd you get 48	2.0
Maybe for the 48 howd you get 48	Actually we didnt	3.0
Are you talking about letter D	Yes	0.0
How did you get that in the journal	I got the 18 from the C and then I added one	3.0
I got the 18 from the C and then I added one	If its a different denominator wouldnt you try and make the 14 into 28	1.0
Im hearing you say 14 is equal to 28 and you can do 2838 and what would you get	58	3.0
Heres your microphone so you can explain both parts of the problem	Okay so we knew that 4520 so we put the two right above the nine so 54	4.0
Okay so we knew that 4520 so we put the two right above the nine so 54	59 what 29	4.0
59 what 29	We got 45 and then you added the two and that would be seven so we put the seven right here and the four right here and then we did 51 which equals 5 and then we added the four and we got nine	4.0
We got 45 and then you added the two and that would be seven so we put the seven right here and the four right here and then we did 51 which equals 5 and then we added the four and we got nine	Then the other zero because we knew what was wrong with this part so added it to 14 which equals four and 19 which equals 9 and 111	4.0
Then the other zero because we knew what was wrong with this part so added it to 14 which equals four and 19 which equals 9 and 111	We knew that we were done with this one so we added two more new ones	4.0
We knew that we were done with this one so we added two more new ones	We knew that 248 so we put the 8 right here	4.0
We knew that 248 so we put the 8 right here	We knew 2918 so we did the 8 and we added the 1 here	4.0
We knew 2918 so we did the 8 and we added the 1 here	You added the 1 here and then we knew 212 so we added 8 to the 2 right because we added the 1 here	4.0
Clay would you please read your final product	We got 41710	3.0
Now Clay my question right now for you and your partner is how do you know your answer is correct	Because its closer to estimates	4.0
Questions comments feedback and would you tell me your name please	Bruce	0.0
Bruce	Yes	0.0
Hey would you please call on someone from our class	Jacob	0.0
Jacob	I want to know how you got the estimates to tell	2.0
I want to know how you got the estimates to tell	Bruce erased it but we knew that 194 we knew that the rule is four less all of the rest so this would just be 190 and then we knew that five is more or less the score so we raised the one and two and then itll be 220	4.0
Am I hearing you say that you did 190220 and thats how you got your estimate	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Okay questions comments feedback on how they got their estimate and I want you to think about words like reasonable and efficient	What Im wondering is my  is like I dont know but how did you get 1800	2.0
What Im wondering is my  is like I dont know but how did you get 1800	41800	0.0
41800	Yes	0.0
They multiplied 190220	Yes I multiplied that	0.0
Yes I multiplied that	I mean how do you explain your answer	2.0
I mean how do you explain your answer	What Franc and I did was we did 20020040000	4.0
Will you call in someone else	Georgia	0.0
Georgia	I thought it could be easier since 194 is really close to 200 I think it would be easier to round it up to 200 and its more efficient because instead of having to multiply 190 times 220 and then 215 is closer to 200 so if you did 200200 you can do that in your head	4.0
I thought it could be easier since 194 is really close to 200 I think it would be easier to round it up to 200 and its more efficient because instead of having to multiply 190 times 220 and then 215 is closer to 200 so if you did 200200 you can do that in your head	Its way easier than having to write it out	4.0
Is this an okay estimate	Yes	0.0
Does it work	Yes	0.0

All right so ladies and gentlemen youre writing this number with a seven in the tens place and a five in the tenths place	Do I write it with a decimal	3.0
Three two one show	Im not done	0.0
Ready and go	Seventy and fivetenths	3.0
My friends I know you have resources at your seat but reminder this is the tens ones and then to the right of the decimal is what	Tenths	3.0
All right Georgia would you read for us what you have please	Like the numbers or how do you read it	2.0
How would you read it	90 and three tenths	3.0
How did you know it was 90	Because nine is in the tens place and the tenths place is after the decimal and the tens is before the decimal	4.0
This one starts with a six in the	Hundredths	3.0
You have to think about what is onethird of six	In the what	2.0
Then we know we go to the hundredths so we know that you have at least how many places to the right of the decimal	Two	3.0
Okay if you could turn your eyes and ears this way please	First  and after the decimal and onethird of that will be two and thats in the hundredths place so itll be 200 and then the decimal and then the sixhundredths so therell be a zero before the six	4.0
Because we have nothing in the tenths place and the zero holds the place right	Then the six will be in the hundredths place	3.0

Thank you my dear go	I did 0020 which was blue 10 cones I think and I had four of the red cones and seven cubes so I thought when I added them together and I got 067 in total	4.0
Okay Missy will take a question comment or feedback	I like how you added which one was blue and which one was red	1.0
I like how you added which one was blue and which one was red	Next time can you label how Like next to the blue you could label 0020	1.0
Or perhaps like units	Yes	1.0
All right whos next	For the blue cones I saw that there was 02 and for the red I saw that there was 047	4.0
For the blue cones I saw that there was 02 and for the red I saw that there was 047	Then what I did was 02  047 to get 067	4.0
Questions comments feedback	Asher	0.0
Asher	Maybe you could put zero in front of the decimal so that we know so that its easier to understand	1.0
Would you say because there werent any whole grids shaded	Yes	0.0
Asher are you agreeing with the sum or the total being 06 and 007	Yes	0.0
We are not doing that sir	I knew that was 02 and red was 4710 and I added it and then for all of them I got 4910	4.0
Questions comments and feedback	Well from the 02 wouldnt it be 20 instead of two	1.0
Lets keep this conversation going	Clay	0.0
Clay	How did you get 049 because you have to You probably just added wrong but supposed to leave Youre only supposed to add these two which are supposed to be six	2.0
When you say add these two be more specific	Add the tenths the 02 and not the hundredths but	1.0
Do you see a little something he could do that would fix this	Finn	0.0
Finn	Maybe he could add a zero at the end of the two but youd have to shift it over because the zero  you could put it like align them all	4.0
Maybe he could add a zero at the end of the two but youd have to shift it over because the zero  you could put it like align them all	Then in the hundredths place you can put a zero behind the two	4.0
What needs to be lined up in this problem	Youve got  there and then the tenth it goes up here	1.0
What were you thinking	You just think about that you can still add that but it will still be the same answer because they would just multiply wrong I mean add wrong but youre just supposed to add tenths and leave the hundredths by itself to get 067	4.0

How many longs are you going to shade right now	Four	3.0
Then how many twos	Seven	3.0
Missy and Georgia will you tell us what you noticed and what you were talking about thats different in subtraction	Georgia said that we had to do We rounded the 47 to 50 and then we did so we got 005 hundredths minus 002 equals 033	4.0
Georgia said that we had to do We rounded the 47 to 50 and then we did so we got 005 hundredths minus 002 equals 033	After we rounded	1.0
After we rounded	We needed to round it to help us get the answer thats why but then we got 033and then we started shading in but then we realized that We started shading in but then we realized that would like be adding the two	4.0
We needed to round it to help us get the answer thats why but then we got 033and then we started shading in but then we realized that We started shading in but then we realized that would like be adding the two	If you shade in both of those amounts youre adding because putting two parts together is adding	4.0
Subtraction is doing what	Taking away	3.0
How are you going to show on the grid that youre taking away do you have an idea Asher	Yes what you could do Yes we just messed up right here because we realized that after	4.0
Yes what you could do Yes we just messed up right here because we realized that after	We shaded it and we shaded in all 47	4.0
We shaded it and we shaded in all 47	Then we colored over top of the twenty to make it only and then you just have to see how much would be left after you shaded it in	4.0
James be my coach	You can shade in 047	3.0
Im going to shade in four longs and how many cubes	Seven cubes	3.0
Now what	I think you should shade 002 hundredths over 047	3.0
Because Im subtracting and Im taking away Im taking away 002 which is how much of this	Just about half	3.0
How many longs	Two	3.0
Does that work	Yes	0.0
Whats left	You can count how many longs and then how many cubes	3.0
We have two longs and how many cubes left	Seven	3.0
Can you show me using that what would be an easier way to solve it	Just cross out the puzzle like you did like three	3.0
Say it	027	3.0

Okay	And I touched them all for  number well seven and 31 tens	3.0
Okay Franc can you help my friend Clay with the one little error he made and explain why	That one two and 49 hundredth	3.0
Why is it not hundredths and not tens	Because of that spell	0.0
Wait	That spell is not	0.0

What I did is the first one was 04 tenths and so you said to go a little bit bigger so I went one decimal I went one point bigger and I went to 05	Then I did 03 tenths for the second one I did 076 hundredths and then I went a little bit smaller and I got 074 hundredths	4.0
I need something bigger than 53 hundredths and smaller than 53 hundredths and I need something bigger than nine hundredths and something smaller than nine hundredths	Okay I can do that	0.0
Come along Ms Hudson lets see what we got	What I did was I did one and four because if it has zero its always bigger and then what s less than one did 033	4.0
What I did was I did one and four because if it has zero its always bigger and then what s less than one did 033	For the second one I did 015	4.0
If I asked you to use them in place value how would you say that 15	15 hundredths	3.0
Very good and that is smaller than or thats bigger than 12 hundredths	Then it s smaller and 12 hundredths is 5 tenths	3.0
Is 5 tenths really smaller	No	0.0
What do you need to put in front of that to make it smaller	Zero	3.0
Now	The next one	0.0
I just  close their eyes	I didnt really	0.0
You didnt really	I just	0.0
Before I go on Im going to show you something	How we can add it	2.0
Franc I need you to stop please	Okay	0.0
Alexander please come up here and share your thinking with us	What I did for my estimate is I rounded 9480 thousands to 95 and	3.0
Ive got friends back here being rude	7241 thousands to 73 and  22 tenths	3.0
Okay	On my number model I did 9480 thousandths minus 2291 thousandths	3.0
Is that two or seven and 291 thousandths	Seven	3.0
Thank you	291 thousandths	3.0
Do we agree with what Alexander did	Yes	1.0
Show us what you did	my number model I said I did 948 so you didnt have to round it which already pretty much rounded to a hundredth	4.0
my number model I said I did 948 so you didnt have to round it which already pretty much rounded to a hundredth	Then 7291 and then I  29 hundredths and I got 219 hundredths	4.0
Kayla	How did you find	2.0
Finn go ahead	This is a four right there	4.0
This is a four right there	You dont have to That means that you just leave them alone but it counts as a zero now since theres no Since you basically rounded that	4.0
Im sorry I dont understand what youre saying	This four is supposed to be the estimate right	3.0
Yes	We got four it would count as a zero because the estimate is an estimate its not like a real answer	4.0
Youre saying he couldve just done 9  2	Yes	1.0
Thats fine	In your number model dont you just put a  and not the answer	3.0
Say Might I suggest next time	Might I suggest next time that instead of you answering that you could put a letter	1.0
Im not even sure where that name came from	Thats exactly what I did	1.0
Thats exactly what I did	I did 9  7 because I rounded I didnt even look at these numbers	4.0
I did 9  7 because I rounded I didnt even look at these numbers	I just looked at the 94 and 4 and rounded it down to 9000 three digits after	4.0
I just looked at the 94 and 4 and rounded it down to 9000 three digits after	Then 7 the 2 is closer to zero  8 so then I 7000 and I got 9  7 is 2 then I attached the zeroes	4.0
Hudson Im going to ask you to join	We already have	0.0
Alexander where is your spot on the rug	Its over there	0.0
Stand up and tell us what you said	I said that its not going to be efficient because you have to 9 is closer to 10 so you can only do the tenths and then you get another grid and then you have to shade it more of that	4.0
I said that its not going to be efficient because you have to 9 is closer to 10 so you can only do the tenths and then you get another grid and then you have to shade it more of that	Then you want two	4.0
Then you want two	Then you get the 7 which is also close to 10	4.0
Then you get the 7 which is also close to 10	Youd be around three grids and thats not going to be efficient	4.0
Youd be around three grids and thats not going to be efficient	Then you have to cross out all of the numbers on the 9 and the 4 and the 8	4.0
Expand and clarify his thinking exactly	I think it would not it would be more than three grids because 9  7 is over 10 and you would have to cross out the two more You would have to count the extra numbers	4.0
If I do this how many grids am I going to need	Nine	3.0
Ashley how many grids do you think Im going to need	16 grids	3.0
What two numbers does that account for	Nine and seven	3.0
Zoey want to expand upon them	I think you will only need one grid because youre not adding youre subtracting	4.0
Kayla what would you like to add	I think you need a hundred because I already told  at first we nine but then you have eight hundredths but you dont need a whole other grid	4.0
Okay Alexander	I think you need 18 hundredths because  48 hundredths and then theres 298 thousandths	4.0
Im sorry someone had a question	Are we	0.0
Yes Sir	Have	0.0
Holly why don t you come up and work with	One minus zero he can t do that he has to cross it out put seven there put the one right there	1.0
One minus zero he can t do that he has to cross it out put seven there put the one right there	Okay now put nine down there and then do okay yes cross that one out put 317 and then one and then yes that was easy	1.0
Mariah go ahead so Mariah who is your sage	Joseph	0.0
Start talking telling Mae	We first wrote the numbers and then we started off with  it cant be zero minus one so we	3.0
There was no zero in the problem why do you put a zero there	Because theres no hundredths I mean thousandths so if put there it wouldnt be	4.0
Thank you	We crossed out the eight put a seven right there and then we did 101 because  we took a whole	4.0
Did you take a whole	No it s a hundredth from the hundred and then we did 101 which we got nine and then we moved to the hundredths place	4.0
No it s a hundredth from the hundred and then we did 101 which we got nine and then we moved to the hundredths place	We  with seven like this and we couldnt do it  we had to take one from the 10th place and then make 17 and then we did 17 minus	4.0
Did you make 17 though or did you make 17 hundredths	17 hundredths	4.0
17 hundredths	We did 17 minus 9 and got 8 and then we went to 10th place an then we did three minus two which is one and then did nine minus seven	4.0
Could you read your answer to me Mariah	We got two and 189 thousandths	3.0
Finn see me on your way back to your desk next up	First we numbers between nine and three hundredths and then seven  added a zero to the 128	4.0
First we numbers between nine and three hundredths and then seven  added a zero to the 128	Then we do the zero thousandths minus three  thousandths minus one thousandths so then over here but	4.0
Good	First of all we deal with the	0.0
Nice that language	Then we attach those zeros because theres  we have to borrow 8 we make that 7  Then we get 1019	4.0
Then we attach those zeros because theres  we have to borrow 8 we make that 7  Then we get 1019	Then we did  89	4.0
79 go ahead	79 so we have to take away  to make it 17	4.0
79 so we have to take away  to make it 17	Then we subtract it to make it 8	4.0
Then we subtract it to make it 8	Then	0.0
Thank you	First of all we knew that 9  is going to be a little hard	4.0
First of all we knew that 9  is going to be a little hard	Then we knew that we cannot subtract one from zero	4.0
Then we knew that we cannot subtract one from zero	We added a one  After that we  Then we did 23 which equals 1	4.0
Thank you	Then we got	0.0
What did you two do	01 we borrowed	3.0
Why couldnt I have just subtracted 7291 from 9408	That what we oh	0.0
What did you attach	We attached a zero	3.0
Do you see what I was doing	Yes	0.0
The first time you did this problem what did you do Hudson	First time I did this problem was I made	0.0
What did you do the very first time when I said thats how much material she needs	so we did 01 and then 89 and then 42 and then	4.0
They added this first	I knew it was a subtraction problem	3.0
What did you realize you had done	Because he had 2point	3.0
	No I had 2199 he had 2211 and then we knew we had to change our answers  Then we crossed out that  181 17	4.0
No I had 2199 he had 2211 and then we knew we had to change our answers  Then we crossed out that  181 17	1798	4.0
1798	Then we crossed that out	4.0
Then we crossed that out	Then 321 and 972 so 213	4.0
Would you phone a friend to add to your thinking	You have to align the decimals up	3.0
You have to align the decimals up	You have to always make sure that	3.0
Quickly	one number has more place values than the first one	3.0
Really the bottom line of this lesson is today that in order to subtract decimals you got to make sure that when you align them if they did not put a number in that place value as Kayla said you attach a	Zero	3.0
The only thing we had to do with that strategy is we had to make sure we incorporated a	Decimal	3.0
What did I call it	The equation	3.0
What did I ask you to create Dianna	I dont know	0.0
This would just be four minus	Five	3.0
Five	Five minus three	3.0
No four minus	Three	3.0
Have you taken onetenth or one whole from that because the three is a whole number	algorithm lets you know how you did it the strategy you did	3.0
Why did you make that six a three	That one is a four	3.0
Did you solve problems	Yes	0.0
Tim whats a mixed number	A mixed number is a number that is	0.0
Will you call a friend for help	Lisa	0.0
Lisa	Its a number thats not a proper fraction	3.0
Its a number thats not a proper fraction	its numbers like for example 2710 or	3.0
You have that confused with an everybody	Improper fraction	3.0
Call a friend to help you out	Addison	0.0
Addison	A mixed number is where you have a fraction and a whole	3.0
Quick turn and talk at your table what is a common denominator	you multiply two denominators together and then you want the sum	4.0
you multiply two denominators together and then you want the sum	And then you add or subtract them the denominators	4.0
And then you add or subtract them the denominators	Well you dont	0.0
Well you dont	Okay lets just do five six	0.0
Paul what did you say a common denominator was	Its like whenever you find a kind of denominator that works for both of the fractions and that makes it easier to minus and wait subtract and add	3.0
What do I have to find in order to make them the same	You have to find the same denominator	3.0
Im looking for one specific word	Franc	0.0
Franc	Like when you have two denominators and you use a strategy to find a common denominator	3.0
Call a friend	Maybe you could use a QCD	3.0
Why do I have to have a common denominator Clay in order to add and subtract fractions	You need a common denominator to add and subtract fractions so it  like draw fractions and stuff	3.0
Okay can I actually add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
Can you review the conversation that you guys had over your homework	From which work	0.0
What were you finding	We were finding that  that our answers werent the same	2.0
How come	Because Clay used a different strategy than the	2.0
What strategy did you use	I used the Q common denominators	3.0
Quick common denominators very good which is what	Which is kind of like	0.0
What do I do	Finding the denominator that both the	3.0
No you were multiplying what two numbers	The denominators	3.0
Clay what strategy did you use	The strategy I used is I took the biggest denominator and tried to make the smallest denominator equal to the biggest denominator	3.0
How	By multiplying it by a number	3.0
Did you multiply the denominator by the same numbers both of them or did you list	I listed	3.0
Addisons the only one that actually was here the day we taught that	I think  multiples of the numbers	3.0
How many wholes are four	Five six seven eight	0.0
When you and your partner are done I would like you to stand up and you should be getting close to being done	Why is this so hard	0.0
First one	Well the first one	0.0
All right go ahead split	Seven half	3.0
How did you come up with three and a half	First we did seven divide by two	4.0
First we did seven divide by two	We got three and a half is divide by three one half	4.0
Brian show me number two	We came up with seventhirds and one and fourthirds	3.0
How did you come up with that	Two and one third	3.0
I m sorry	We knew that three times two equals six and onethird plus six equals seven	4.0
We knew that three times two equals six and onethird plus six equals seven	We got seven thirds and then we just added part of the seven and made it a whole	4.0
Show me the last one	Me and Ian counted from fours up in We counted our denominator up to our numerator	4.0
Me and Ian counted from fours up in We counted our denominator up to our numerator	Then we used our answer and then we put it together	4.0
Then we used our answer and then we put it together	We put N and got four threes	4.0
How can I check that using what you have there	You count up fours and you keep your answer When you get to four fours you put one hole down and when you get up to holes you keep	4.0
If you dont know I want you to call a friend	Since the denominator is four you would do four times four which is 16	4.0
Since the denominator is four you would do four times four which is 16	You add 16 to three and thats 19	4.0
Go	Wait	0.0
Wait	Wait which problem	0.0
Wait which problem	All these	0.0
I think you know what youre doing	Yes I know	0.0
Is it going to be closer to a half one or one and a half	One	3.0
Is it more than a half less than one or one	More than one	3.0
Explain to me why you said half	I thought if you did the	0.0
Is a half	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Is it going to be wrong	No	0.0
You are done with all the math boxes Kirsten and Charlotte would you please compare	With your map	0.0
Now we have one	Number five I got a little more than 7	3.0
How close is it to one hole	13	3.0
Just your estimate buddy	We just finished	0.0
We just finished	Did you get 12	1.0
Did you get 12	Did you get about 12	1.0
Did you get about 12	What	0.0
What	Did you get about 12	1.0
Missy	Yes	0.0
Do you think you can explain this buddy or would you like to bring a table member	I think I can do it	0.0
Russel you think you can do it	Yes	0.0
All right go ahead Becca	For number one I thought it was about 12	4.0
For number one I thought it was about 12	When I solved the problem I did 5 x 4 and since  and then did 2 x 4 so the denominators 20	4.0
When I solved the problem I did 5 x 4 and since  and then did 2 x 4 so the denominators 20	Then 2 x 4 is 8 and then 1 x 5 is 5	4.0
Then 2 x 4 is 8 and then 1 x 5 is 5	Then I did 8  5  8  5	4.0
Are you estimating or solving	Estimating	3.0
Becca Im going to ask you to phone a friend thats got their hand up in the air	Tyler	0.0
Tyler	Ms Strathom which problem	0.0
Whats an easy way to estimate that	If you thought about it 25 is kind of almost half and then 14	3.0
Is it almost half or is it less than a half	Less	3.0
What about 14	Its less than a half so she  like about a half	3.0
Can you use that strategy that I just talked to you about to do the next one	I said its about  because 49 is closest to a half and 39 is closes to a half and	4.0
Okay	I said it was	0.0
Could you show me the numbers please	I said it was a little more than one	3.0
How did you know that	Because I know that 34 is closest to a whole	4.0
Because I know that 34 is closest to a whole	I know that 58 is over a half so I  is about one	4.0
Show me number four Russel please	What I did first for my estimate is	3.0
What did you do buddy	I drew two circles  45	4.0
I drew two circles  45	I drew two circles and then  fifths and I colored four	0.0
I drew two circles and then  fifths and I colored four	Then I had one circle and then I did a third and then I colored a two and I know that was a little less than four because 2  1  3	4.0
Then I had one circle and then I did a third and then I colored a two and I know that was a little less than four because 2  1  3	45 and 23 is pretty close to four	4.0
Becca show me what you thought was the easiest and why	I thought that number  because the denominator is the easiest because the denominator is the same	4.0
Kellen which one did you think was easiest and come and show us why	I thought number five was easiest because 116  116  216	4.0
I thought number five was easiest because 116  116  216	Then two wholes plus five wholes equals seven wholes so 7 and 216	4.0
This is the conceptual understanding of this is being able to look at it and know just by looking at the fraction if Im close to a half less than a half Am I close to a half or close to a whole	Whole	3.0
Juliana explain what you guys talked about	We just talked about that 78 is closer to a whole because its only 18 behind so it will be close to a whole	4.0
Its closer though a whole because if I do my fractions here Im going to do 18 28 38 48	is a half	3.0
Then I have 58 68 78 88 or	One whole	3.0
If I did this with fifths I have 15 25	You did 23	3.0
Is 35 more than a whole	Yes	0.0
Do two four and five	Two four and five	0.0
Im going to look is that closer to a whole or half	A half	3.0
Is this close to a half	No	0.0
What do you think	Seven	3.0
What do you think	Six	3.0
Explain to me why you said seven Alexandria	Because three four	4.0
Now to sole this what do I need to do first	Add	3.0
I have to find that common denominator and you said its 24	equals 24	0.0
I want you just to estimate	My common denominator is 15	3.0
Is two thirds closer to a half or a whole	Whole	3.0
Is three fifths closer to a half or a whole	Closer to a half	3.0
What is your estimate	10th	3.0
Why 10th	B is closer two equals 9 and got that one answer	4.0
What do you think I need to do	There s three denominators	4.0
There s three denominators	There is going to be six times three	4.0
Its not six times three six times what	Four	3.0
Equals six times what equals 24	Four	3.0
Then what I do to the bottom I Okay whats one times four	Four	3.0
Three times six equals		3.0
What do I need to do with that	Six and 10 is 244	4.0
The next one is seven and three	Eight	3.0
That is my bad	How did you solve the problem	2.0
What number is that		3.0
Sorry friends	I still have that	0.0
Bless you	Thank you	0.0
Go	Ms Ms Strathom do you want me on the table	0.0
You dont have one so you dont need to worry about it	Ms Ms Strathom can you come	0.0
Ms Ms Strathom can you come	No you can do this Addison	0.0
Addison dont automatically say you dont know how to do it	I dont	0.0
What do you need to do	A common denominator	3.0
No weve already got a common denominator	I cant do minus 23	3.0
Why cant you	Because	0.0
What can I do	You add a common denominator	3.0
No what do I need to do from that whole	Take some from here	3.0
Franc	Yes	0.0
Clay do you have a partner here	No	0.0
You have to come to a consensus	Because if you cant subtract 13 that is supposed to be a two but then you would add a whole to that so yes thatll make it 31 is 43 and then you subtract with the 43	4.0
the same	The one with fractions they both have the same denominator for each problem	3.0
How are they different Clay	The answers of one and two are bigger	3.0
Kayla were you able to solve problem one in your head	Yes	0.0
How come	Because they have the same denominator and the top denominator was bigger than the bottom denominator	4.0
Whats the top number	Four	3.0
What is that called	The numerator	3.0
The numerators	The numerator was bigger than the other numerator so you would do just 41 and it was 3	4.0
Could you please do that again	You would do 41 and that would be 3 and then that will be 35 and that one will be 3 so it will be 3 35	4.0
Ms Clay were you able to do the second one in your head as easily as you were able to do the first one	The first one was easy	3.0
Okay explain to me why	On the second one you can subtract 31 but you cant subtract 1323 because theyre smaller so I had to take a little bit from the whole and then I turn the whole into two and then put the rest on the fractions and then I got 43	4.0
So you had to take a little bit from the three	Yes	0.0
Franc how much of a little bit did she take	One whole	3.0
How many then is she adding to that 13	She got in 33 to 13 or 1 13 so thats what brought her to 13	4.0
Am I correct	Yes	0.0
When you borrowed you suddenly made it 11 am I correct	Yes	0.0
Yes	I made it 11	0.0
What did you make it honey	I made it 43	3.0
What did you make it Stan	I was pointing to her	1.0
ShBrucely what did you make it	I made it 113	3.0
I made it 113	I made it 113	1.0
How many of you made it 113	I made it	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Did I give out round 2 of the 10 ego box	No	0.0
I wrote them I just didnt give them out	10 ego box	0.0
10 ego box	We actually got 20	0.0
Okay did you agree on your estimation	Yes	1.0
Yes	I got Never mind	0.0
What do you mean by that	Because me and Joshua agreed on both of them but then Stan didnt get it	1.0
What did you and Joshua agree on for the estimation for number three	We agreed on that the answer was closer to zero	1.0
If I have 910 and 810 is 910 more than 12 or less than 12	More	3.0
So if I had 810 is that more than 12 or less than 12	More	3.0
More	Less than 12	1.0
So if I have 12 and 12 how do I get zero	We thought that this 910 was close to 1 and then 810 was a little close to 1 and then 11 is closer to 0	4.0
Why are you disagreeing with that	Our group disagreed because some of us did 110 and then Tony had gotten 010 and then Becky got 210	1.0
Dwayne	If you added them together	3.0
What would your estimate be	About two	3.0
If this is not a good fit Im not going to be a happy woman	Im saying that if you go through it and then you see	0.0
Clay show them what you did with your drawing and show them why its different than what they did	I drew the circle and I split it into 13 and 9 and then its subtracting eight from nine	4.0
I drew the circle and I split it into 13 and 9 and then its subtracting eight from nine	I crossed out nine of them	4.0
Does one line work better than putting both of them	Yes	0.0
Dwayne would I add those together already or would I just do the problem one drawing at a time	Just at one time is better	3.0
Wheres your 13	We have that common denominator	3.0
We have that common denominator	So draw the circle	1.0
Lisa what is the first thing that you notice about this problem	I notice	0.0
What do you notice about the problems looking at it	4x3	3.0
What else do you notice	Then how you notice that theres 12  so those 34 then times	3.0
Bruce what are you saying	The common denominator	3.0
The common denominator	I did 26 and then 36	3.0
What would be the next step	The next step would be	0.0
I would like to see how you think you should solve it using your slates	Individually	0.0
Now do what you said you were doing	First of all 912412	3.0
Nessa whats 912412	Is it 512	3.0
Is it 512	It s like 2 4 6 8 10	1.0
Did you find your common denominator	Yes	0.0
Dont solve the problem I just want to see the gaps	Im just going to go ahead and make a big one so I dont mix up my problems	0.0
Show it so that everyone can see it	Okay so I did 3 13 and I knew that 2x3 is 6 so I did 1x2 which equals 2 and then I did  then I put these 3 right here and then I knew about 1 12  3x26	4.0
Okay so what fractions are you now subtracting	1 56	3.0
Can I just subtract that	No	0.0
I cant	We can	3.0
We can	Yes we cant	3.0
Were going to erase that and I want you to write it bigger over here	Because 5x3 will be 15	4.0
So is one whole is going to give me a bigger number at the top than at my bottom	Yes	0.0
Right	Right	0.0
Now can you do it	Yes	0.0
Bam bara bambam	Bambam	0.0
Go	Isn t Laura supposed to coach us through five	0.0
Three times what equal six	Two	3.0
What times two equal six	Three	3.0
Okay not I have three and twosixths minus one	Threesixths	3.0
Why not	That number is	0.0
That number is	Whats six minus two	1.0
Where am I borrowing from	Three	3.0
Okay my three becomes a	Two	3.0
but how many did I borrow from that	A whole	3.0
A whole sixsixths so what do I need to do now	Sissixths plus twosixths	3.0
Now can I borrow	Yes	0.0
Whats my answer	Now its oneeighths	3.0
No each table member should have gotten one	She got two	1.0
Do you understand where your mistake was made	Yes	0.0
Im sorry if I shu	Its okay	0.0
This is where your problem	we have 10 minus four and twothirds equal to four	3.0
we have 10 minus four and twothirds equal to four	Because we minus	4.0
Whats 10 minus five	That would be our answer	3.0
Okay you have to do a whole step before you ever get to that point	No I add to the four	3.0
How easy is that problem to solve	Thats what I get	0.0
Can I take two from three	Borrow to the whole	3.0
Borrow to the whole	Well whenever youre trying to	0.0
How many did I borrow one whole of what How many wholes did I borrow	Four	3.0
Four	Nine plus seven equals 16 thats how they got nine and then you took a whole of	4.0
Two and eightsixths whats eight minus three	Equals five	3.0
My friends that I have not spoken with please look at problem number is it six that I wanted you to look at	No five	0.0
No five	Number five I think	0.0
Whatd you get	I got one and fivesix	3.0
If I have 3 and 13 and Im going to turn my	Shes got six and 715 so help her	1.0
If I borrow one whole from here how many do I borrow	onesixth	3.0
I took one whole	sixsixths	3.0
Then once youve talked about that Have you guys done that	Yes	0.0

You got 12	We got two 10 and 12	1.0
Listen to what shes saying Dwayne	isnt it a plus problem	3.0
isnt it a plus problem	Addition problem	3.0
Are we ready to listen	Its going to be 12	3.0
Still waiting	Three six nine then 12	3.0
Okay when you agreed on your answer did you doublecheck your work	Yes	0.0
Because I just had you guys talk because you were ready	said it was difficult to solve the problem because you have to convert because you cant do like	4.0
What did you have to convert sweetie	The denominators	3.0
What did you have to make them	Common denominators	3.0
Then what did you have to do	Then we had to solve the problem	3.0
Well you	exchange because we had to	3.0
Franc expand on exchange	We didnt subtract I dont remember the numbers we didnt subtract them the top one from the bottom one so we had to	3.0
The top one from the bottom one language	The top number from the	3.0
Which is called	Well no I dont remember  the two fractions and then we had to go to the whole number and	3.0
We couldnt subtract the fractions because the top numerator was	Small	3.0
Then I had to exchange it for a	Whole	3.0
Joshua Im gonna ask you what did you notice	I looked at the rule and I looked at the bottom and I saw that I was five and I saw that it started to count by five as soon as theyve been ordered	4.0
Are they only going up by fives or are they going up by more	It will be	0.0
Alexander I think you want to add something to it	Its kind of like a pattern you close in with 10 15 and when I add 10 you are going back to five	4.0
Its kind of like a pattern you close in with 10 15 and when I add 10 you are going back to five	When you do 10 and you add five will be 15 and you add 10 that will be 25	4.0
When you do 10 and you add five will be 15 and you add 10 that will be 25	You add five more it will be 30	4.0
Im coming to my other friends in a minute	I noticed the in is 10 but its onefifth of blank	4.0
I noticed the in is 10 but its onefifth of blank	I thought I could do like 5   10  2	4.0
What was his rule	If you divide the in by a fifth then you can get an out	1.0
Tell me how it works with 10 and three fifths	If you divide the in 10 by five then you re going to get two	4.0
I did not ask you to answer Clay s question	6   3  2	4.0
6   3  2	When you multiply it by two or divide	4.0
Go	I want to add for example in 25 you find fifth If you re trying to find three fifths and you find onefifth first that will be five and then if you make it three fifths and you times it by three	4.0
I want to add for example in 25 you find fifth If you re trying to find three fifths and you find onefifth first that will be five and then if you make it three fifths and you times it by three	I also noticed that	1.0
I also noticed that	The rule is to	0.0
Jackson	Three fifths and if you do like 10   5  2 x 3 is six then you get the three from that three	4.0
You want to add to something Clay	I know it s a lot of multiples like three	3.0
What part of the fraction is that	The denominator	3.0
10   5	Two	3.0
Here was the step that Franc didnt take it to was Then I have to do 2   1 is	Still two	3.0
5 x what  2	Five	3.0
Sorry 5 x what  10	Two	3.0
2 x 1 is	Two	3.0
5 x what  10	Two	3.0
3 x 2	Six	3.0
5 x what  25	Five	3.0
5 x 3 is		3.0
5 x what equals 15	Three	3.0
3 x 3	Nine	3.0
5 x what  30	Six	3.0
6 x 3		3.0
Do you see how I got my outs	Yes	0.0
5 x what  25	Five	3.0
5 x 1 is	Five	3.0
What should my out be	Five	3.0
Kaylee 5 x what  15	Three	3.0
3 x 1	What	0.0
3 x 1	Three	3.0
What should my out be	Three	3.0
5 x what  30	30	0.0
5 x what  30	Six	3.0
6 x 1	Six	3.0
Whats my out going to be Royce	Six	3.0
Do you see how easy it was to get those ins and outs	Yes	0.0
Did that make sense	Yes	0.0
Yes maam	Are we going to play that game where you do the	0.0
Do you believe youll be working with a partner for this	Yes	0.0
Whatd you get for the first one Clay	I knew so the 12 of 12 I knew that 66 would equal 12 so 12 of 12 would be 6	4.0
I knew so the 12 of 12 I knew that 66 would equal 12 so 12 of 12 would be 6	I knew it would be 712 because 77 14 plus 12 and 12 would equal 15 so 712	4.0
I knew it would be 712 because 77 14 plus 12 and 12 would equal 15 so 712	12 of 40 would be 20 because 202040	4.0
Okay who can expand and tell us a different way to solve these	You could see how much two could go into 12	4.0
You could see how much two could go into 12	Six times so that would be the answer but because its an even number about four two goes into 15 that will be 712	4.0
Okay so what do you mean goes into	Divide	3.0
Another way Franc	You could have 2 times	3.0
Blank	Blank equals 12 and then you could do 2x7	3.0
No keep going Franc Im going to stop talking	You could do 2x7 but	3.0
Okay lets do it again	Thats what you meant as toolboxes	0.0
Kayla Im going to come to you so you better be getting some answers	Hold on I need to substitute these	3.0
Try and I will allow you to phone a friend okay	Im stuck	0.0
Im stuck	Im stuck on the first one	2.0
So 12 3	To get that and then multiply that and I get the answer	3.0
Bless you	Thanks	0.0
12 3 is	12  is 4	3.0
4x2 is	Eight	3.0
15 3 is	Five	3.0
Five and 5x2 is	5x2 is 10	4.0
Okay wait a minute	Wait no Im doing multiplication	3.0
Wait no Im doing multiplication	Wait	0.0
Big boys	For the first one I did 3 12	3.0
Make sure you use the bigger number because itll come out to be Yes	12 34 and then I did four 4x28	4.0
Do we agree	Yes	1.0
Okay tell me the second one	For the second one I did three times 15 equals five	4.0
No you did Yes Im sorry	15x3	3.0
3x515 Im sorry	3x515 and then I did 5x210	4.0
Okay and then what did you do in the last one sweetie	Then I did 3 6020 and then I did 20x240	4.0
Okay so does five times anything equal 12	No	0.0
No but whats closest to it		3.0
10 how many are left	Two	3.0
I am then going to let Joseph do the second one and Im going to have Missy coach because you coached that one correct	Yes	0.0
I need you listening she is explaining	For the first one I did 12 5 and got 225	4.0
Help	It was 23 instead of 13 so you have to divide it by two	1.0
Why if I times two	Its a whole number	3.0
Where did the 45 come from	It come from when you just make it four on top of a one	3.0
Thats what I was wanting you to explain because some of them didnt understand where 45 came from because your partner behind you didnt understand where the 45 came from am I correct	Yes	0.0
Do you remember what it was	25 of 31	3.0
25 of 31 and explain what you did	What I did was I used  divide five into 31 and I knew that 5x6 will give you 30	4.0
Okay write it down as youre going	Then I saw that I still had that one you left for it and then put 15 forward and then I saw I needed to multiply it by two so I multiplied it by two and I got 1225	4.0
Im seeing 15 but Im not seeing 25 on there	I multiplied 2x15 as well to get the 25	3.0
So you did 615 times two which was 1215 then you did two times	Two times	0.0
Do you know what Im asking you to do	Yes	0.0
When I multiply those straight Missy across just what do I have	25	3.0
Rebecca you are doing 25 of 81	We first write down 81 and then its 25	3.0
Of 25	81 5	3.0
Should it be 25 of 81	Yes	0.0
Okay now you may do your process	81 5	3.0
81 5	No 81 5	3.0
Do you want to 81 in the Okay divided by five	81 5	3.0
I want the answer	You do 81 5	3.0
Which is what		3.0
16 with what leftover	15	3.0
15	15	1.0
15 leftover so write 1615	1615x2 is 7 two you multiply	4.0
Right so now shes telling you to do 16x2 which comes out to be what	That would be 1625	3.0
My five group Im going to have	Miriams gone	0.0
Okay so I want Kurt to explain what her thinking is and then Im going to have Judy explain his	I do 34 and that I included 12 and then theres 14 left	4.0
I do 34 and that I included 12 and then theres 14 left	You lift that 14 over into 12 that would make 28	4.0
You lift that 14 over into 12 that would make 28	Then if you add one of the eighths to a half it would be 58 because you have to make	4.0
Clairedon you need to be listening please	find the common denominator and it gives you 1218 I got 58	4.0
Can you do it with the fraction circles	Yes	0.0
She was getting ready to get them to you	12 224 and the 18 I think	3.0
Okay go	12 is equal to 24 and if you split 412 like Kurt said is 28	4.0
12 is equal to 24 and if you split 412 like Kurt said is 28	The 14 leftover you split it into 28 and you put 28	4.0
The 14 leftover you split it into 28 and you put 28	Because theres 28 for each 14 you take 28 over 28 over here you get one more 18 and you put it on each side and that will be 38	4.0
Do you see how he did that	Yes	1.0
The 12 of What was	Three	3.0
Was it 12 of 3	Yes	0.0
12 of 3	Were still working on ours	0.0
Dottie are you done	Yes	0.0
It is 12 of 3	and then you have 12 of 2 is one so you can split the leftover 112	3.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
Theres that and theres that	Got it	0.0
Clairedon what was the most challenging part of that for you	I think the most challenging part of that for me was like if you were to divide like 12 of 24 when I was trying to figure that out I saw that it was hard because you just have a whole that you could spread into pieces to have a fraction to make it into	4.0
Anyone else want to add to that	My most challenging part was that the whole numbers couldnt be divided by a half	3.0
When the fraction you mean couldnt be divided by a half	Yes	0.0
Alayna who is your partner at your table with you	Judy	0.0
Judy	I was just saying that	0.0
The first thing I would like you to do is fold the paper in half vertically	Wait what if it went this side	2.0
It should look like this am I right	No because now it looks like a book	3.0
You can have two pieces of paper on your desk	Yes but this was my first piece	0.0
So if my paper is an entire fruit bar what does it represent now	A half	3.0
Half of that fruit bar so Larry has half of this fruit bar what part of the half fruit bar are we trying to find	A half	3.0
Now you are going to fold your sheet in half which is now	The taco way	3.0
Okay so now you had it folded this way now youre going to open it up and fold it in half	Fold this	0.0
What does this represent	14	3.0
What is it really	12	3.0
12 of a	12	3.0
Which means Larry gave his brother	14	3.0
What did my whole sheet of paper represent	Full	3.0
Full	No a 12	3.0
My whole sheet was what type of	A whole	3.0
Then I folded it because Larry only had	No it was a 14	3.0
No Larry only had	12	3.0
Then he wanted to split what he had with his brother	He gave him 14 of the bar so he has 34 left	4.0
So a half of the half is a	14	3.0
Oh my gosh disconnected that is going to make me crazy	Sorry	0.0
Your book is gone then	Awesome	0.0
Hi this is a hot little mess	Yes	0.0
We keep pushing it down but it keeps coming back	So I dont know if youve seen the Chronos Extreme covers basically you just need an extreme cover	0.0
I just want this gone to work	Okay	0.0
I dont know	Okay	0.0
Okay	You know what	0.0
You know what	Im actually going to send these things back now with another guy and just get you slotted with our main package	0.0
What is this	A whole	3.0
A whole what	A whole veggie pizza	3.0
So what are we going to do	Fold it in half	3.0
Kaylee what am I going to do to represent what part of the pizza Ava has	Were going to fold this into two halves and were going to color or pencil one of these halves	3.0
Okay wait Asher what am I representing with my paper	12	3.0
12 of what	12 of the veggie pizza	3.0
Who has the half of the pizza	Ava	3.0
What am I folding it into	Fourths	3.0
How are you folding it	Into thirds	3.0
Into thirds	You cant fold it like that	1.0
How am I folding the paper	Into thirds	3.0
Does everyone have a piece of paper that looks like mine	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
Kayla how many of these squares that Ive colored in of my half am I going to color in now	Two	3.0
What did she eat	23 of the pizza	3.0
Color in two of those thirds	of a part of a pizza forget it	3.0
How much of a whole pizza did she eat	23	3.0
How much of that half did he share with his brother	14	3.0
How much of the whole pizza did she take	A half	3.0
How much did she eat	23	3.0
Ready	I have no	0.0
In this first one what am I going to fold this paper into	A half	3.0
What am I folding the paper into what does it tell me to do first	a half	3.0
Explain why I would do a half first	Because if you did 13 then you can find it	4.0
Because if you did 13 then you can find it	Its not a 12 of a 13 its	4.0
In my book what would I do here	Fold	3.0
Now what do I need to look at next	You need to look at 13	3.0
Do I need to color in my half	Yes	0.0
Okay now what am I folding the paper into	23	3.0
Okay so now does my paper represent a 13 of a half	Yes	0.0
What does my paper now represent	a half	3.0
No whats the answer	23	3.0
No	16	3.0
Why 16	Because its	0.0
How many total pieces do I have	Seven	3.0
How many of them did I use	One	3.0
One	13	1.0
Do the next one by yourself	Ourselves	0.0
Split it in half Clay	sit on the chair	0.0
How many whole pieces do I have Clay	Two	3.0
How many whole pieces do I have Clay	Four	3.0
How many squares are there Clay	Six	3.0
How many of them are colored	Two	3.0
What is my fraction	46	3.0
What did you come up with	26	3.0
Youre going to pick one to model on a piece of paper the other one youll get to draw	Okay	0.0
Fair	Yes	0.0
So whats the first thing you need to divide the paper into	Fourths	3.0
Here Kayla that was yours for you homework	Will you give us time to	0.0
What do you think is easiest to split it into	Fourths	3.0
lets count them	One two three four	0.0
One two three four	One two three four	0.0
One two three four	One two three four	0.0
One two three four	Three by four	0.0
Now I have to divide it into what	Thirds	3.0
How many of those thirds am I going to color in	One	3.0
One	So then youll have 112	3.0
Why do I have 112 Becca what does that tell me I have	12 squares	3.0
Ricardo youre looking at me funny	Why did you not color that one as well	2.0
That comes out to be 112	You didnt actually give us the whole	3.0
What do you think Gabby	Another strategy though it might be similar to find a common denominator	3.0
Well yes	That makes sense	0.0
That makes sense	Yes because 4X312	4.0
So did we apply and extend our understanding of finding fractions of whole numbers to finding fractions of fractions	Yes	0.0
Do I expect you all to be pros at it	No	0.0
Youre to stand somewhere so I know youre done	Okay and now five	3.0
You guys done	Wait it will be the exact same answer wont it	3.0
Wait it will be the exact same answer wont it	No because five divided by 15 equals	1.0
So you can now join me on the floor	I was doing	0.0
Tera	Yes	0.0
Please tell me what strategy or strategies you guys used to solve problem number one	So what we did is me and Dean here divided the  by the numerator in the rule	3.0
In number one you divided	Yes	0.0
Yes	We did five divide by 15 and then one	3.0
What answers did you get all the way down	Three four seven and two	3.0
Okay because you did 15 divided by five is	Three	3.0
20 divided by five is	Four	3.0
35 divided by five is	Seven	3.0
10 divided by five is	Two	3.0
Everybody understand the strategy that they used	Yes	0.0
Paula explain the strategy you used	Me and my partner said five goes into 15 and  to 18 and five goes into 15 three times	4.0
What	Dividing	3.0
Linda	We did five times blank equals 15	3.0
Bruce I called on you and you get one even though you because you said I did it the same way	Im done	0.0
They wanted you to be able to understand I am doing 15	Divided by	3.0
times	One	3.0
How many pairs are in there	Three	3.0
Makes sense	Yes	0.0
What did you notice	the numerator are the same	3.0
Even though they were a different process that they were asking you to do hey we have that they come out the same	doing 15 divided by five equals three and they just have one	1.0
I would have to have different in numbers wouldnt I	Yes	0.0
Lisa what do you think	I think that because it would  would not be the same here	4.0
If you disagree with Lisa show me with your hands	If you think	0.0
Diana why do you disagree with Lisa	Because if you make 15 to 18 then it would give 16 of	4.0
What would they be of six	Multiples	3.0
All as Im doing is changing what Im multiplying	I dont think that it would give an outnumber that would be different	3.0
I dont think that it would give an outnumber that would be different	Those could be the same	3.0
Those could be the same	but I think it would be the in number	3.0
If I changed it to 16 all of my in numbers would have to be multiples of six right	Yes	0.0
It is one divided by five because five divided by one would be	One	3.0
So because now I have 10 and five times two is 10 but its 02	More like a decimal	3.0
Its now 15	divided by one would be one	3.0
What could this be written as	15	3.0
Would it be 13 or would it be what	15	3.0
What did they change this 15 from	Five	3.0
They made it a whole number so what would this one be	Three	3.0
Georgia who are you with honey	Them	0.0
Could you please explain that to me again	10 it goes 5   15  3 3 x 3  9	4.0
10 it goes 5   15  3 3 x 3  9		1.0
	Then 3 x 15 is 45 and then 5	4.0

What did your table group talk about Franc	We talked about that we that its telling us that theyre equal and when we knew that because were	3.0
Whats the word for fractions	Theyre equivalent	3.0
To interpret this you told me that I was looking at equivalent fractions right	Oh yes	0.0
Because I can take 13 I can break it into 26 and I can break it into 45	412	3.0

How much did group A take	They took	0.0
Youre saying youre doing 112 eight times right	Yes	0.0
Remember all I do is multiply them across when Im multiplying I have to multiply straight across	Okay thats why	0.0
Does that makes sense	Yes	0.0
I love your conversation that youre having but No wait tell me what youre doing dont do it just tell me what youre doing	To make the	0.0

Did Roberto walk over to you and said please walk outside	No I didnt	0.0
I want you to think about Oh hello what are you doing over there babe	It was connected to your seat when you walked out and then it just like that I think	0.0
So it would be five	But its a fraction not a whole number	3.0
What did you just say	Its still a fraction not a whole number	3.0
What are you saying Mariah youre looking at me youre going what	Its going to be the same youre just switching the spots	3.0
So now being able to look at a question Gerogia rather than saying Im still confused why dont you listen	Okay	0.0
We have a collection box down here and were going to start with looking at their process okay	Oh like it	0.0
Let me give you some think time	Can we do it in decimals	3.0
Are we working on decimals	No	0.0
Give me a way	One and one half	3.0
Nope thats one and a half	A whole	3.0

Dont they	They are	3.0
What are 3 fractions that are equivalent to one friends	22 33 44	3.0
Those are your answer for the first one	Wow	0.0
Now in order to have a whole what do my numerator and denominator have to be	Theyre the same	3.0
Theyre the same	Equal	1.0
Equal	Its equal	1.0
The same	Same	0.0
Theyll have to be the same	Same both	0.0
Do a quick turnandtalk to your neighbors please	Oh he doesnt have	0.0
Oh he doesnt have	Because you have an alternative	3.0
Because you have an alternative	I think it makes sense because like three thirds is one whole and two halves is one whole because its one whole	4.0
I think it makes sense because like three thirds is one whole and two halves is one whole because its one whole	If I have a number line and if it goes up one then it goes up to one	4.0
Great	which is also one like two halves or four quarters its going to be the same thing	3.0
which is also one like two halves or four quarters its going to be the same thing	I was thinking like	0.0
Missy youre explaining this to me	Oh my oh	0.0
Where youre talking about it	Yes	0.0
Im going to let him explain what you were talking about	Can you tell me	1.0
Big voice please so everyone can hear	It means two are  are equal one whole	3.0
How do that denominator and numerator equal one whole	Oh my God	0.0
Oh my God	Because of	0.0
Gerogia	The numerator and the denominator have to be the same	3.0
Why that	Well they have to be the same because if they werent the same like say like four fifths that it will be close to a whole but not a whole	4.0
JulGabbya	If like Mariah said we have a fraction so a quarter	1.0
Okay go ahead	Like Mariah said if we put a fraction its closer	4.0
Like Mariah said if we put a fraction its closer	If weve 44 and its a whole	4.0
If weve 44 and its a whole	Wholes if you put them together we do all four pieces and 44 top of if or like a whole	4.0
Wholes if you put them together we do all four pieces and 44 top of if or like a whole	I hope someone can add on that	0.0
Friends what would you like to add on	Well if writing a number line and the number line when it has like 12 for example one half or whole because a whole on a number line is one whole which is also two halves	4.0
Well if writing a number line and the number line when it has like 12 for example one half or whole because a whole on a number line is one whole which is also two halves	But I was trying to say that	1.0
This was something that as a child I didnt understand	Thats	0.0

Im going to do Missy is that what Im going to do	Yes	1.0
Hold your paper up until everyone is done	With the denominator of 12	3.0
With the denominator of 12	Before we came I would write the fraction by their names	0.0
Before we came I would write the fraction by their names	How	2.0
How	Oh because your number is 6 of	3.0
Oh because your number is 6 of	Yes fraction names from one	1.0
Yes fraction names from one	It would have to be 33 because we have to make the denominator	4.0
Everybody got it	4x312 and 3x39	4.0
4x312 and 3x39	This one would have to be two right	3.0
This one would have to be two right	For the denominator	3.0
What is 4x3	4x3	0.0
4x3		3.0
Okay and whats 5x3		3.0
Dianna what did you get for the very last one	is I did 4x4 is 16	4.0
Gerogia what are you doing	You are multiplying them	3.0
Say it to what	One whole	3.0
Isnt it like that	Yes	0.0
So I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	Can you repeat that	0.0
I multiplied 45 by the same number in the numerator and in the denominator	Is it	0.0
Okay does 2x412	No	0.0
Does 3x412	Yes	0.0
So the first one is 44 what would that next box be	Three times four thirds	3.0
You knew that four times what equals 12	Three	3.0
What do I need to do up here Gerald	3x4	3.0
I threw you off times	Over here	0.0
Over here	I can figure it out	2.0
I can figure it out	The 23 and 49  you triple the 3 to get 9 then you have to triple the two to get 6 so 69 and	4.0

Get your whiteboards out and dry erase markers for me please	No its not like	0.0
Yes sir	Ill even show you	0.0
Were down to 20	Yes thanks for telling me that theyre not	0.0
Okay pick someone Frankie to explain why	I wanted to  because when youre multiplying something youre breaking it up in smaller parts and stuff	4.0
Is that what you said	No no	0.0
No no	He said three fourths	1.0
Its less than okay	Oh it was	0.0
If you believe you can now explain why he is incorrect Marco go ahead	Because  you would have to put the denominator two  to multiply	4.0
I would put my three over four	Three over one	3.0
Are you ready for	Yes Marcoua	0.0
What would that give you real quick	Nine fourths	3.0
Nine fourths and what is nine fourths equal to	Its going to be equal to	0.0
The next one we are going to have Bruce	I was saying that three fourths is greater	3.0
Georgia tell me why you disagree with it	Why I disagree because I know 34 times one equals 34 that will be equal to	4.0
Is it greater than less than or equal to 34	I think that 34 is bigger	3.0
You think that 34 is bigger so 34 times 1 12 is less than	Yes	0.0
Asher tell me why you agree with this	Because three times one equals three and then four times two equals eight	4.0
Because three times one equals three and then four times two equals eight	I know that 38 is less than a half and 34 is over a half	4.0
I know that 38 is less than a half and 34 is over a half	34 is bigger	4.0

I do have apples come here	Okay Ive finished 56	0.0
Raymond I need your voice off	Me and my team did equal groups because we thought that would be the easiest one	4.0
Okay so lets see what they wrote	There are 56 kids in a spot and the Ms Strathom would want eight equal groups	3.0
There are 56 kids in a spot and the Ms Strathom would want eight equal groups	How many children are in each group	3.0
Tell me Roge	Seven	3.0
Explain your process that you used	If she wants 8 equal groups that means 7 people are going to be in each group because that will be 56 students	4.0
Is there a different mathematical process that I could use	Maybe 7 times 856	4.0
Thats what he just said	Or 5687	4.0
Asher explain to me how were going to figure this out my friend	Well	0.0
Youre going to start seeing  during math	Okay	0.0
Go ahead	Yes	0.0
Yes	Well you could do like what Daniel did 5687 or 8756	4.0
Okay do you see why I want to go to that party I get seven cupcakes	Cupcakes yes	0.0
Cupcakes yes	Except that might be too much frosting	0.0
All right so Margo you are up	This is what we did	0.0
Bring it over here so we can see it please	What we did was we did now we have a length of 7 and we have a width of 8 and then if you multiply them together youll get 56	4.0
Does that work	Yes	0.0
What are you figuring out there	Youre multiplying 78	3.0
To get what	To get 56	3.0
Theyre talking about inches we know that theyre coming up with 56	Widthlength Well its like 78 like widthlength	3.0
Lengthwidth	The area	3.0
Could you  so that we can see it all	There are 56 kids which we used to split the kids into eight groups	3.0
There are 56 kids which we used to split the kids into eight groups	How many kids are in the groups	3.0
Missy explain	So we saw ours we could do 568	3.0

Could I divide in this instance	No	0.0
Call a friend if you dont know	Were not dividing	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
You guys did a great job with that	Thank you	0.0
So now Im going to display two more numbers	Wait two	0.0
Do you have a question	No I already know	0.0
No I havent even given you the number story how can you have an answer	Sorry	0.0

I need to know what mathematical process you would use why and how much of his allowance did he spend	Franc	0.0
Franc dont forget your owl buddy	Oh yes	0.0
Okay	We could use multiplication because 3 x 2  6 which is 23 of nine and that he spent six of his allowance	4.0
Six dollars of his allowance	Six dollars	0.0
Rebecca what did you guys talk about	So we did 933 and 3 x 2  6	4.0
So we did 933 and 3 x 2  6	So we know that 933 so we have 93	4.0
So we know that 933 so we have 93	No	0.0
No	It was	0.0
Would you find a friend at your table to help you out please	Come	0.0
Come	So we did 93  3 because theres thirds so you have to divide it by three and then we times it by two because two its not 13 so it will be 2 x 3 divided it in thirds then 3 x 2  6 and six is how much he spent of that allowance and then two dollars is whats left	4.0
What did you guys figure out Becca what did you talk about	I said that we figured out you have to do multiplication so I made the nine into a fraction to make it easier to do the multiplication and I got 253 and three can go into 25 and I got 8 13	4.0
Can they spend 8 13 of their allowance	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	You have to save nine dollars	3.0
Can I spend 8 13	No	0.0
Does that make sense	No	0.0
Marco can you explain the next step	Missy	0.0

Can you reach them babe	Yes Im done	0.0
Makes sense	Yes	0.0
Roberto Im going to have you because you disagreed with Gabby so Im going to have you because you had a thumbs down am I correct	No	0.0
Who had a thumbs down	I had a thumbs down	0.0
Okay go ahead	Other times when Ive multiplied its turned out less than the fraction that I multiplied the whole number by so I immediately saw it and I didnt even have to multiply it	4.0
Other times when Ive multiplied its turned out less than the fraction that I multiplied the whole number by so I immediately saw it and I didnt even have to multiply it	I just immediately thought that it would be less than because normally when we multiply a whole number to a fraction its less than the fraction	4.0
Go ahead explain your thinking	I knew that we can add the denominator well one of the denominator and  the other one and then 8 x 1 is still 8 and then 7 x 3 is 21 and thats bigger than 78	4.0
If I do this the way that my friends with the thumbs up said what is 7 x 3		3.0
And 8 right	You can break it down to	3.0
To what	Ill break it down into twelfths	3.0
Ill break it down into twelfths	Not twelfths	1.0
What is 8 x 3 everybody		3.0
Do I automatically now know by looking at this that its less than	Yes	0.0
Its less than 3	Yes	0.0
Go ahead	May I explain	0.0
Please do because Im explaining this and I showed how its less than three this way but you explain what you did	May I draw it	0.0
Im very sad we dont get to go see the kindergarten play	Yes	0.0
Go ahead	Normally in my head I would think of so its a whole so I will think of 78 x 33	3.0
Explain that to me	Because there are three wholes and so the denominator is three	4.0
Okay	So 7 x 3  21 and 8 x 3 is 24 so its around a  I dont know if it is 78 or its equivalent to it or if its bigger I would have to do the math	4.0
Go over and explain the way you did it	I basically did the same exact thing as Kaylas	1.0
I basically did the same exact thing as Kaylas	I did 7 x 3 is 21 and then 8	4.0
Because it does come out if I put it as a whole as 258	Actually even more as the denominator is one	3.0
Because you always put it over one	Because its a whole	4.0
There was your misconception	Normally I thought that would be three wholes but now I realize that thats a one whole	3.0
My hands are old	Oily	0.0
Thumbs behind your whiteboards	Can I have more time	0.0
Was your thumb up or down	My thumb was down	3.0
What did you think it was	I thought it was up	3.0
Explain why you thought it was down go over to the board if you need to	I thought it was less than because of 23 you multiply the denominator by the denominator which is 24 and then the numerator by the numerator which is 14 and 1424 is less than 78	4.0
What is 78 closer to	One	3.0
What is 1424 closer to	12	3.0
12	12	1.0
Friends with your thumbs that were down or up does this make sense	Yes	0.0
Thats what I was going after	Its only two friends that shes sharing it with	3.0
Thank you	Is it okay if I come up and talk to you	0.0
No I haveFranc and IsaGabby coming up	Are we going to do these the two and	0.0
Are you done	Yes	0.0
First of all explain what the question was asking you	The question was asking	0.0
Big voice	The question was asking how many pieces	3.0
Do the bread	do the bread	0.0
Okay goahead	For one I think  knew that the 14 there was two of them and then 18 so I did 14	3.0
Im asking a question here are they telling you to multiply these or are they telling you to divide that	Divide	3.0
Would it be 14 x 8 14   8 or 8   14	Eight	3.0
Why 8   14 and you can call on someone if youre not sure why 8   14 versus 14   8	Because then youd have a negative number	4.0
Andy you want to add	Because if you used 14   8 you have to divide 14  into eight pieces	4.0
Nicole	What if you do 2   14	3.0
Why would I do 2 14	Because you only have two pita breads	4.0
You get the way she worked with multiplication to make it work	Yes	0.0

All right so show us what you did	I did half a yard each so half of a yard is 12	4.0
I did half a yard each so half of a yard is 12	It asks how much halves he has	4.0
How many halves	I got nine halves because 1  1  2 and then I did 12  12 equals a whole and so I added them together I think 3 6 and 19	4.0
What did you do Donte	I made a number line and then I know I had  so I put it up to three and I did halves and that three	4.0
Elinor I would like you to explain it the way you did it	What I did was I made three strings and I split them in half and I counted each half and thats one two three four five six and then I have 63	4.0
63 or 62	62	3.0
Thank you	I just put three yards long because its three yards on there	4.0
Roge tell us what you did	What I did is I knew that therell be three divided by those halves so I made a square and then I split it to 12 and then I split into 12 and then I split into 13	4.0
What I did is I knew that therell be three divided by those halves so I made a square and then I split it to 12 and then I split into 12 and then I split into 13	I forward then 12 because its 12 and its closer to 1	4.0
I forward then 12 because its 12 and its closer to 1	Then I circled the one of the 16 because 26 doesnt count so itll be 16 and not 32	4.0
He said there were 62 yards	Okay	0.0
Go	Hes correct because in	1.0
Can you look at Roges no leave your chalk there can you look at Roges and tell Roge where his misunderstanding was	I think his misunderstanding is when	0.0
What was his misunderstanding	That it shouldnt be thirds because its a whole	1.0
What sweetie	Because he shaded in the half but he didnt shade in the thirds of the three	1.0
He didnt divide it did he	No	1.0
If he wouldnt have shaded anything in what would you have come up with	I dont know	0.0
If you didnt shade in those three how many pieces would you have had	About three pieces	3.0
No youre not listening	Six pieces	3.0
It didnt ask you to multiply anything it asked you to divide it	I didnt multiply	3.0
What it asked you to do is take your three yards and divide them in half so if you would have taken your three yards and divided in half how many halfpieces would you have had	Six	3.0
Its when you shaded that you confused yourself	Thank you	0.0
All right so makes sense	Yes	0.0
Asher you understand what you were doing	Yes	0.0
Heres what you couldve done that would have made this easier because you knew that you had three yards right	Yes	0.0

Is that what you guys are going to do	Yes	0.0
To group number two what are you guys going to do	We said were going to draw a number on and then 4 14 through 7 34	3.0
4 14 and what	7 34	3.0
So would that mean I go 4 12 4 34 5 and so on	Then five and so on yes	0.0
Then five and so on yes	Yes	1.0
Well group number three what are you guys going to do	We did 3 through 7 34	3.0
Thats what you did	No	0.0

What we did was we did 3 14 all the way to 7 34	Yes its 3 14 all the way up to 7 34	1.0
Did you do 34 for each number or did you do 3 34 4 4 14 4 24 4 34 4 44	Yes	0.0
Table group number six what did you do	Were going to use the number of 4 14 up to 7 34	3.0
Am I really going to want to graph something that big	No	0.0
So what is my smallest number	3 34	3.0
What do you think my next numbers should be	4 14	3.0
Why wouldnt I just be able to go 34	Because of those	0.0

Could I	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes you could	1.0
Could I do that	Yes	0.0
Would that be a more efficient way to do it	Yes	0.0
Is it an efficient way to write 14 24 34 44 in between each number	No	0.0
But could I	Yes	0.0
Could I do that	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Do you understand why	No	0.0
What do you not understand	Well why would you start in 3 14 and the go to 3 12	2.0
Well why would you start in 3 14 and the go to 3 12	That doesnt make sense why it would	2.0
I said I wouldnt use the 14	Oh	0.0
Why is that a more efficient way to do it Marco	Because youre doing a 12 and you dont have to do 14 24 34 and everything	4.0

Gabby what did you write down for the first one	I got 19	3.0
Jenn explain why that will not work	I didnt really understand this	2.0
Matty	13 x 19 is 127	4.0
13 x 19 is 127	Right	0.0
Yes	127 and  out 13 is bigger than 127	4.0
Why	Because  fraction is just getting smaller and smaller	4.0
Gabby did you hear that	No	0.0
Explain that again	You use a fraction and it gets smaller and smaller	4.0
Matty wont her 19 work here	Yes it would because it would be 5 and 72	1.0
570 seconds	Yes	0.0
58 is	Bigger	3.0
Okay Ms  What do you think buddy	For the first one I did 11 because 3 x 1  3 and 4 x 1  4 so	4.0
Franc what did you do for the second one	For the second one I did 9 x	3.0
Does that work people	No	1.0
Ricardo tell me why not	It doesnt work because its a smaller fraction than nine	1.0
It doesnt work because its a smaller fraction than nine	Yes its a smaller fraction than 910	1.0
Well 910 and 910 are equal to one another	Its equal to	3.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Clay what did you guys talk about	Well I said it was well that 24  1  24 and that I know  number after the decimal it would be greater	4.0
Whats 44 Vicki		3.0
Georgia explain	For me and  to make it easier to multiply  I mean the one  and you would do 62  12 and 13  3 but 3 can only go into 12 4 times	4.0
For me and  to make it easier to multiply  I mean the one  and you would do 62  12 and 13  3 but 3 can only go into 12 4 times	Itll be less than	4.0
Roberto what do you think	I think that it would be greater than 24	3.0
Think about what we talked about up above Roge	It would be less than because you cant multiply a small	4.0
I dont have a whole group of two do I	No you dont	0.0
Miss Jenn if the second factor is less than one what do we know about the product	What does it mean when the second factor	3.0
What do I know	I know that if the first one is a whole number its going to be less than	4.0
If the second factor is greater than one what do we know about the product Martin	It will be greater than	3.0
Martin will I have more than one group of the whole or less than the whole group	More than the whole group	3.0
Martin	It will be less than because its	3.0
If the first factor is greater than one everybody what do we know about the product	Its going to be greater than	3.0
What numbers are you using to estimate	Are you going to	0.0
What number would I estimate 128 to be	Around	0.0
When you are asked to round is it easy to multiply 13 times 185	No	0.0
Is it easy to multiply 10 by 200	Yes	0.0
Am I correct	Yes	0.0
Janessa tell me the first thing you did for 128  1853	Our estimate	0.0
Yes what was your estimate	10200	3.0
Which equals		3.0
Matty tell me what you guys did for 8961 times 27	We did 9003 and we got 27 Wait 270 Or	4.0
Kurt tell me what you did for 41  07	We did 1  41  41 because we rounded	4.0
Why wouldnt you have just done 41	Thats what I did say	0.0
Your estimate was 41 correct	Yes	0.0
Margo tell me what you did for 09  03	We did 101	3.0
09 is closer to 10	I mean one	3.0
Times	One	3.0
One	We did 10	1.0
Its understanding that if 2 plus 2 is 4 20 plus 20 is going to be 40 and 200 plus 200 is going to be		3.0
What do you notice about the factors in these problems and what do you notice about the products in these problems	Its a first factor and then what I really noticed the first problem is theyre in their hundreds the first factor is in the hundreds	3.0
Go	I did 11  28 then first	3.0
Because you just told me you did 11x28 thats not estimating thats actually doing the problem	No I knew that 11x28 will make it 308	4.0
Go ahead talk to me	Our answer was 11x28 and our estimate was 10x330 and 30 was close to 308	4.0
Janessa did you notice anything	The first factor the first one was in the hundredths place and then all the way down	3.0
The first factor the first one was in the hundredths place and then all the way down	The second one the second factor or the second one was less than one so itd be in the last place and then the last one the third factor The second factor was in the tenths already	3.0
What	That they all have 28	3.0
Alexander	It goes biggest medium and then small	3.0
What of the decimal places are they all in the same place	No	0.0
No	Not even close	3.0
Are they going to be the same numbers	No	0.0
Why did you place your decimal over here	It could be 5x1	3.0
Are you rounding the numbers	I think it should be 1000	3.0
36 is that closer to 30 or 40	I can divide it by 20	3.0
Is six closer to one whole	It would be 100 divided by	3.0
What do I need looking at this as a dollar	Oh my God thats your desk	0.0
What is 20 times 30	It would be close to 600	3.0

Okay go ahead	What I did is I estimated 05 to 1 then I did 1 x 410  410	4.0
What I did is I estimated 05 to 1 then I did 1 x 410  410	That was my estimate then I said 410 is correct	4.0
Closest to	Is closest to 205 so if half of 1 is 05 another half of 410 is 205	4.0
That is the detailed part of the explanation that is missing	Bless you	0.0
Can I help you	Yes	0.0
We automatically know that if were multiplying something by one what does that tell us	Its the same number	3.0

Roge	Did number three Mike	0.0
Hes like Seriously Ms Strathom	I did 1045 because 25 if you round it up you get three and 410 x 3  1230	4.0
I did 1045 because 25 if you round it up you get three and 410 x 3  1230	So you have to take four because you added 12 to your 25	4.0
Did I add a half or cut a half from three	Cut a half	3.0
Was it easier if you did 410 x 3 or would it have been easier to do 400 x 3	Easier to do 400 x 3	3.0

Am I going to add subtract multiply or divide	Divide	3.0
Okay	Well what I got was 2102 because I did four goes into eight twice so I	4.0
Youre not using mathematical vocabulary	Well because 4x28	4.0
Im not multiplying anything there	Its probably by division way	3.0
Thank you	I put a two  here and I did 4x28 and I did 880	4.0
I put a two  here and I did 4x28 and I did 880	Then I said four goes into four once so I put a one above the four and I did 1x44 and zero	4.0
Then I said four goes into four once so I put a one above the four and I did 1x44 and zero	Then I got four goes into one zero so I put up there	4.0
Then I got four goes into one zero so I put up there	I brought the two down so I didnt have to add more to  over there	4.0
Im not seeing anything after you came up with zero	Right here because four cant go into	4.0
Do you see what Im saying	Yes	0.0
and Im going to have Stacy show you hers	out of 8412	4.0
out of 8412	Then first I did  the 20 four times or is it yes 3 four times will be 80 like 8000 if you did 2000x4	4.0
Then first I did  the 20 four times or is it yes 3 four times will be 80 like 8000 if you did 2000x4	I got the  80 and then I subtracted and	4.0
I got the  80 and then I subtracted and	I got 412	4.0
I got 412	Then I did 1 and	4.0
Then I did 1 and	so it was 4 how much dollars are left	4.0
so it was 4 how much dollars are left	I counted 4	4.0
I counted 4	4 times 3 is 12 so 1212 is 0	4.0
4 times 3 is 12 so 1212 is 0	Then I  that together	4.0
Then I  that together	and I got 2106	4.0
and I got 2106	Okay	0.0
Do you understand why Im saying your division was not complete	Yes	0.0
Please tell me	Maybe I can write  when I get a strategy for it	0.0
Okay does that make sense	Yes	0.0
What do you think Stacy	Maybe a hundred 4 or 80 4	4.0
Now if you wouldve done that how much did you have left		3.0
If theres four kids how much did they each pay up this for	30 cents	3.0
wheres your decimal going to go after	Bless you	0.0
Archiel let me see yours	Wait so wait	0.0
Wait so wait	See is this is why I worried about the decimal	3.0
Let me see what you did	Ive erased because of the decimal with	3.0
Its got nothing to do with the decimal because the decimal should be able to go right back in	I did	0.0
3 times	200 because 600	4.0
Because 600	Thats correct	3.0
Great so 600 and then 8 is		3.0
246	Yes	0.0
and then you did 50	Even thats why it goes on 50	4.0
Even thats why it goes on 50	no one who could fix here minus	4.0
If I lined all those up	No like you	0.0
No like you		3.0
If I was dealing with 846 cents where would my decimal go Archiel	everything	0.0
Oh you said the eight down here	I dont know	0.0
If I do No this would be 282	Also	0.0
I got to do this differently	Sorry	0.0
Go get me a piece of	Excuse me	0.0
Can I		3.0
846 3	The next one is 4	3.0
1 0 96 and 66 and	With this	0.0
36 8	Thats it	0.0
Archiel come here for just a second	Thanks welcome	0.0
Whats less than 100		3.0
Jyle whats 50x3		3.0
What do I have to do again	Minus	3.0
145 is	This is too	0.0
3 times what is going to get me closest to 90	is six	3.0
3x6 is	Is nine	3.0
I want to get close to 96	16 times	3.0
You just got me into the hundreds	Oh is it like 30 times	3.0
Times	three	3.0
30x3 because what is that going to equal Jyle		3.0
What about Jyle		3.0
You add remainder five you would change that to three because were rounding okay	Oh	0.0
Im not sure then what youre doing talking to Addison	Do it the same way I did it with	0.0
I need to see where youre at right now	Well I just erased all I had because	0.0
of	Grid paper	0.0
Read the first one with me	I can solve problems including conversions between money units	0.0
The second one	I can solve multistep number story about money and time	0.0
James who is your partner	Ella	0.0
Did you guys get the same answer	No	0.0
Okay Ella can you explain what James told you when you solved he problem	What he told me was that Luke and Meg had the most because Meg had hundred have and Luke also had one hundred because I wasnt looking closely enough	4.0
What he told me was that Luke and Meg had the most because Meg had hundred have and Luke also had one hundred because I wasnt looking closely enough	and I thought Luke had one dollar bill	1.0
James how could you prove your answer	I said that you said that Meg had a one 100 dollar bills so 1x100	4.0
I said that you said that Meg had a one 100 dollar bills so 1x100	Denise had nine 10 bills so 9x10	4.0
Denise had nine 10 bills so 9x10	Luke had 100 1 bills so 1x100 and then Dawn had	4.0
Yes I think it was six 10s	six 10s	0.0
Louie	Maybe he could explain how he got their money and how they got that number	1.0
Jaden what would that look like	If it was doing the amount of money they have it would be a hundred equals	4.0
Is greater than or equals	A hundred is equal to a hundred because they both have a hundred	4.0
Could you show that 100 is more than all the other ones	Yes	0.0
Your dry erase board you just have in front of you	I did a hundred is bigger than 90	4.0
I did a hundred is bigger than 90	so Meg and Luke have a hundred and Dawn and Denise have 90	4.0
so Meg and Luke have a hundred and Dawn and Denise have 90	I also did 90 has two digits and 100 has three digits	4.0
Joey	How many minutes are in an hour	3.0
Oh I missed an important piece of information where are they going	To San Diego	3.0
How much are the train tickets	4200	3.0
Beep beep beep	Beep beep	0.0
Why did you do 42x3	Because you said that theyre three people and they had to buy three train tickets	4.0
Did everybody get 126	Yes	0.0
How about number nine	200126	3.0
How did you get 200 first	Because theres two 100 bills	4.0
If they pay 200 do you think they want some change back	Yes	0.0
Yes I think the B part is really about less math	Some	0.0
A partner pair there what did you guys get for B	I got seven 10 bills	4.0
I got seven 10 bills	and then I did four times 1 bills	4.0
and then I did four times 1 bills	I added those up together	4.0
I added those up together	and then I got 74	4.0
How is it going to be different	Solving a twodigit number	3.0
Yes instead of doing two digits by one were doing two digits by	Two	3.0
I want to see who can find a vocabulary word that weve used before on this paper	Partitioned rectangles	3.0
What else	Strategy	3.0
The first one we know six times eight is	48	3.0
Okay the next one we know six times four is	24	3.0
We know nine times nine is	81	3.0
Dennis	20 has just a zero	3.0
Can you draw your rectangle	Yes	0.0
Do you remember how to do that the other day	Yes	0.0
We think of is there anything to decompose in 20	No	0.0
Its just another extra step or two	Okay	0.0
Do you have any idea how to do it this way	I do	0.0
20 x 4	Yes	0.0
Remember youre talking about number one	Oh	0.0
Talking about number one	Okay	0.0
Everybody share with a lot	I know its 40	4.0
I know its 40	Three is  600 and then 4 x 2080 but 4 x 28 and then I saw one zero and then 180	4.0
Three is  600 and then 4 x 2080 but 4 x 28 and then I saw one zero and then 180	20 x 34 would equal 680	4.0
Can everybody share what you got	I cannot see where is the	0.0
Did you guys solve with the same way	Yes I have	1.0
Did you get the same answer Miles	Yes	1.0
Does anybody know how to do a partial product with the second one	No one	0.0
Has anybody tried it out	I tried it and I didnt even get the	0.0
Ill try it again	Okay	0.0
All right James	I got 600 because	4.0
I got 600 because	30 x 20 is 600	4.0
30 x 20 is 600	Okay 3 x 2 is 6 and then I add the two zeros	4.0
Okay 3 x 2 is 6 and then I add the two zeros	I got 80 by 20 x 4 which is 80	4.0
I got 80 by 20 x 4 which is 80	Then 0 x 4 is 0 and 0 x 30 is 0 and then I got 60	4.0
Carter	8 x 6	3.0
6 times what	30	3.0
Mason what do we do with the two twodigit numbers	What you do with the two You have to bring them up	3.0
Everybody say Decompose	Decompose	0.0
What do you think Jaden	We used two strategies	3.0
We used two strategies	It was column addition and then the partition rectangles	3.0
This is column addition making sure we add up everything correctly and have them lined up but what really is this	The partial product	3.0
Look here everybody say 30 x 20	30 x 20	0.0
Whats 30 x 8	240	3.0
What is 3 x 30	90	3.0
Whats 3 x 8	24	3.0
Raise your hands if you like to start with this one first	Yes	0.0
What is 40 x 50	200	3.0
doing that its pretty frustrating	100	3.0
Then were going to do 2 x 6 is 12 and if I add them up 552	I thought we got it	0.0
Were going to take 20 times what	30	3.0
What am I going to do next	30 x 4	3.0
Ava make sure you write this out so you know	Do we have to use the rectangle	0.0
30 x 60 30 x 4 and Im going to take 2 x 60 and 2 x 4	4	3.0
Be prepared to explain with a partner	Come on	0.0
Yes	That s what I explained	0.0
That s what I explained	They didn t look all correct	0.0
30 times	Perhaps two	3.0
No	30 x 20	3.0
Can you draw your partition rectangle	Yes	0.0
You can add on you can justify your answer you can revise your thinking all right go	On the six here what I think he did wrong is that he got to do	0.0
Doing that one	There are two right	3.0
There are two right	I said that they re correcting	0.0
Do you want to come over and talk with this group	I agree with you because  agree with	1.0
I agree with you because  agree with	You could just add on to this	3.0
What do you think	I know it 30 and 20	3.0
I know it 30 and 20	203	1.0
Did you guys all get the same thing	20	3.0
20	Presentation that we agreed on	1.0
Very good	300	3.0
300	400	3.0
400	600	3.0
Maybe share the star of what you starred here	What I starred was I meant most about this part I starred there	3.0
Why did you star that	I starred that because I feel like I did the explaining and everyone in my group did it pretty close explanation	4.0
Can you share what you thought the mistake was	I thought the mistake was him leaving out the zeros and three because he did 3 x 20 and there s no 3	4.0
I thought the mistake was him leaving out the zeros and three because he did 3 x 20 and there s no 3	There s a 30 and a 30	4.0
He said three was just	Three	0.0
Is it in the ones place	No	0.0
Does everybody agree with Mason on that point	Yes	1.0
Maybe you have something else to share	Also that the three and the 20 should be 30 x 20	1.0
James I see that you didn t put your partition rectangle but what did you do here	I did the partial products	3.0
Who did a partition rectangle that they want to share	I did	0.0
What	I did a partition rectangle	0.0
Anybody think something Charlotte can you come up and share what you were thinking	Yes but it doesn t have a partition rectangle	0.0
Can you explain	The three and the times 20 is wrong because they re supposed to be zeros and not just a plain old three	4.0
The three and the times 20 is wrong because they re supposed to be zeros and not just a plain old three	It s supposed to be a zero and a 20	4.0
It s supposed to be a zero and a 20	I found that same thing with 30 and eight	4.0
Awesome give Charlotte a power clap one two three clap	I just saw something on her work and it said it s eight in the one s place but it had 80	1.0
In which work	Yes she put an 80	1.0
Charlotte can you bring it up real quick	Yes	0.0
All right your job is to use some partial products can you do a rectangle if you need to	Yes	0.0
Do you think you know the formula for perimeter	Length plus width plus width plus length	3.0
Everybody read that with me	I can find the area when the perimeter and only one side length are known	0.0
Everybody tell me the formula for area	Length times width	3.0
Do we know the width	No	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Hey Louie what did you get	330300	3.0
Right James	I got 3303 because I did 367 because thats the length	4.0
I got 3303 because I did 367 because thats the length	I got 734 so I know what the length is	4.0
I got 734 so I know what the length is	Then I did 752 which is the perimeter minus 734 to equal 18 then I divided that by 2 to get 9 so I know that theres nine on each width	4.0
Then I did 752 which is the perimeter minus 734 to equal 18 then I divided that by 2 to get 9 so I know that theres nine on each width	Then I did 367 x 9 to get 3303	4.0
Jaden you did too you did the same thing	Yes	1.0
What did James do at the beginning Mila	He knew that in the perimeter was 752 and to get the perimeter you have to add up all the sides to get the same length so if you add those	1.0
If this is 367 the other side is going to be	367	3.0
Now can I do area on step one	No	0.0
Louie what did he do	He added 3  up together and then he did minus of the perimeter and then minus 752734 and he got 18	1.0
Who thinks they can summarize step number three and share step number three Jaden	James did 18   9  2	1.0
Why did he do 18   2	Because he got 18 x 2 and we all know 18 is the product of 9 x 2	1.0
I see what strategy did you use for multiplication	Partial	3.0
Did you get it right Louie	No	0.0
What did you do at the beginning	What I did is I added 357 twice and I got 734	4.0
What I did is I added 357 twice and I got 734	Then I added up to 752 and got 18	4.0
Then I added up to 752 and got 18	Then I knew that each side was 9 and then I did 9 x 367 and did 300 9 times and got 2700	4.0
Then I knew that each side was 9 and then I did 9 x 367 and did 300 9 times and got 2700	Then I messed up on 60 9 times I had those and I actually got 440 instead of 540	4.0
Then I messed up on 60 9 times I had those and I actually got 440 instead of 540	Then I did 7 x 9  63	4.0
Then I did 7 x 9  63	Then I added those together and got 3000	4.0
Joey	I would put the 9 on the bottom instead of the 5	3.0
Mila	I would also put the 9 at the ones	1.0
What is something that maybe you could think about for next time	Maybe	0.0
Do you see the one two three and four	List the steps	3.0
You had that right	Yes I got this	0.0
Yes I got this	I added 367  367  734	4.0
I added 367  367  734	I thought that times were 18 so I had 18	4.0
How did you get the 18 over here	When I got this I got 18 so I got both side for 18	4.0
When I got this I got 18 so I got both side for 18	Thats how I got the	4.0
What are you going to do next time if you have the perimeter	Try to split them in half	3.0
Were going to also look at this second part which is finding areas by subdividing	I dont think I can ever stop counting on that like 507	3.0
Okay come on over have a seat	He keeps on doing it	0.0
What is this compared to Are they the same	No	0.0
Jaden	That one isnt a complete square  complete rectangle	3.0
Knowing how to add things up but something I noticed if I were to complete this rectangle would I know my length and width	Yes	0.0
Hillary whats the length	The length is the three	3.0
Holly	10	3.0
The length is 10 whats the width Charlotte	Seven	3.0
What is the width	Six	3.0
So everybody add up seven	Seven	0.0
What is that	Nine	3.0
Plus three	12	3.0
Plus four	16	3.0
Plus 10	26	3.0
Plus six	32	3.0
Beep beep beep beep	Beep beep	0.0
Mila what are you thinking about this rectilinear figure	You would have to divide it from  You would have to cut that part out then add two together	4.0
What is two times three	Six	3.0
What would be the area	53	3.0
53	54	1.0
Whats something that helped you when you thought about this problem	You break it up into steps	3.0
Who were you talking to	Eli	0.0
Joel do you have something to add	50 x 6  350	4.0
Eli do you want to share what he did to get 50	He got the 300  500 6 times then he got	1.0
Were you saying at the end thats how he got 50	Yes	0.0
Kennedy do you want to share how you got 50	I knew 10 x 5 was 50 and then 5 x 6 is 300 so 300 and it would be 50 off	4.0
I knew 10 x 5 was 50 and then 5 x 6 is 300 so 300 and it would be 50 off	The answer would be 50	4.0
Mason	Have the dollar sign	3.0
Its always good to learn from other peoples mistakes and how they did it	We still got to do	0.0
Its okay	Can I just leave it	0.0
Rynn what would be one	We need to highlight 19 violin students	3.0
Another piece Chase	Each violin has four strings	3.0
Charlotte	The strings are two each	3.0
Christine	They come in a set of four	3.0
Do you see something else I should highlight Ella	He wants to buy two sets of strings for each student	3.0
Then the last part would be what Charlie	How much money	3.0
If you look Beep beep beep	Beep beep	0.0
Ava	200	3.0
Pay attention because I Pay attention	What I did is I solved that on the problem that it comes in four sets and each string cost 2	4.0
What I did is I solved that on the problem that it comes in four sets and each string cost 2	I added four times two is eight but he buys two so 16 on each student	4.0
I added four times two is eight but he buys two so 16 on each student	Then I did 16 times 19	4.0
Then I did 16 times 19	Then I did 10 times 10 is 100	4.0
Then I did 10 times 10 is 100	Then 10 times 60 is 60	4.0
Then 10 times 60 is 60	Then nine times  Yes	4.0
Then nine times  Yes	10 times 6 is 60	4.0
10 times 6 is 60	9 times 10 is 90	4.0
9 times 10 is 90	9 times 6 is 54	4.0
9 times 6 is 54	I added them and I got 204	4.0
Jaden who did you talk with	Ella and	0.0
With zero voices	She did 10 times 4 is 4o	4.0
She did 10 times 4 is 4o	9 times 4 is 36	4.0
9 times 4 is 36	Then Im guessing she did She went over here and did 76 times 76 plus 76 is 152	4.0
Then Im guessing she did She went over here and did 76 times 76 plus 76 is 152	She did 152 plus 152 is 304	4.0
She did 152 plus 152 is 304	She did 70 times 2 is 140 and 6 times 2 is 12	4.0
She did 70 times 2 is 140 and 6 times 2 is 12	Added that together 152 and then she got 152 here	4.0
Ella what did you arrive at for your answer	I wrote 304	3.0
I see the word estimate here	Yes because I did my estimate	4.0
Yes because I did my estimate	I changed the 19 which Im guessing I should maybe take out maybe I might keep it	4.0
I changed the 19 which Im guessing I should maybe take out maybe I might keep it	I changed it to a 20	4.0
I changed it to a 20	First my estimate I did 2 times 4 is 8 8 times 4 is 32	4.0
First my estimate I did 2 times 4 is 8 8 times 4 is 32	Times 20 and then I did this here	4.0
Times 20 and then I did this here	Then I got 640 and for my actual problem I did 2 times 4 is 8 times 4 is 32	4.0
Then I got 640 and for my actual problem I did 2 times 4 is 8 times 4 is 32	Then I changed it to 19 which was the students and then I did this	4.0
Then I changed it to 19 which was the students and then I did this	Then I did 300 270 which got 570 plus 20 590	4.0
Then I did 300 270 which got 570 plus 20 590	Plus 18 is 608	4.0
Plus 18 is 608	Then I found that 608 and 640 are close together	4.0
Very close	You should say take 640 even though it costs 608 so you get 32 back	4.0
Joel do you have something to add	Instead of going to 640 he could have just gone to 610 and that would have been easier 610 instead of 640	1.0
Is that what you did	No I was just saying	0.0
Why did she get four fourths and four fourths Tae	She  two wholes	1.0
Luis and then Austin Luis can you come on up	I did one and four fourths	4.0
I did one and four fourths	I did two wholes and onefourth	4.0
How did you know theres two wholes	Because  so I knew that two was two wholes	4.0
Awesome do you want to share	Yes	0.0
Yes	What I did I one fifth	4.0
What I did I one fifth	I added 11 to three and I got 24 and then I just left the bottom like we learned the other day and and I got	4.0
Wow and what is that bottom called	Its called	0.0
She said I mark the denominator is that what youre saying	Yes	0.0
Silas	Where did you get the number	3.0
What do you want to add on or say	I did it differently	1.0
I did it differently	I did	0.0
Nick can you explain what you did	What I did I set at one threefifths  and then another and then another one yes	4.0
What I did I set at one threefifths  and then another and then another one yes	It had onefifth	4.0
Can you share what you did	I added one	3.0
Heres one whole and heres one whole and then this would be three of them	I added all of those	3.0
Do you have an equation written down	For the two and threefifths I did five plus five for those two wholes I got 10 and I did threefifths  thirteenfifths and then I did one and onefifth so fivefifths plus onefifth and I got sixfifths and then I added those together to get nineteenfifths	4.0
How did you know it was three and fourfifths	Because five plus five plus five is 15 and the 19 is	4.0
What is one plus one plus one	Three	3.0
Landon what do we do	The ones are whole and the ones that read isnt whole it would be	3.0
How are you	Good	0.0
Good	How are you	0.0
Im sorry theres so much	Female SpeakerThats all right	0.0
Dylan can you share what Stella did	I think she did 210  45100   and then she said she did 310  45100  47100	4.0
I think she did 210  45100   and then she said she did 310  45100  47100	I did that because 210 and then theres	4.0
Can you share	I said that it was 20100 in gold because 210 is 15 of 100 so that means that 20100 is 15 of 100	4.0
Why did you change it to hundredths	Because thats easier because everything else is hundredths	4.0
come on up	say is that the denominators werent the same	4.0
say is that the denominators werent the same	You have 210 and then you have 45100 so you have to make them the same denominator to be able to add	4.0
You have 210 and then you have 45100 so you have to make them the same denominator to be able to add	You have to turn this into hundredths which	4.0
he said was they had different what	Denominators	3.0
You have decided if Im doing this was it 45100	How do you know	2.0
I know its not this now because they dont have what	The same denominator	3.0
Dylan	You can only add the numerator together if the denominator is the same	4.0
Can you give me an example	Okay	0.0
Okay	210  510	3.0
Could I add these together	Yes	0.0
Grayson can you share the rule for everybody	You need to have the same denominator to be able to add a fraction and get an equivalent	4.0
If this has 100 at the bottom Grayson how would I do that	You would change 210 to 20100	3.0
10 x what is 100	10	3.0
Ready	Yes	0.0
1 and 2	Okay	0.0
Okay	Check your answer	0.0
Sofia	I got 1110	3.0
Justin what did you write	1 and 110	3.0
Is either answer acceptable	Yes	0.0
Logan what do you notice	That the denominators arent the same	3.0
Logan can you explain how you did Number 2	Sure	0.0
Sure	I did it 3 x 10 because I know that 3 x 10 gives me 30	4.0
I did it 3 x 10 because I know that 3 x 10 gives me 30	I did 3 x 10 and then I got 30 and then I added the other to 90100 and then I got 1 and 20100	4.0
John could you write it like this	Yes	0.0
Do you always have to go and make the 100 the denominator	No	0.0
Over here if I get a 10 I can get an equivalent fraction so instead of multiplying what am I going to be doing	Dividing	3.0
100  what is 10	10	3.0
What is 90  10	9	3.0
Is that the same	Yes	0.0

Dan	Youre going to have to divide 100 by 10	3.0
This doesnt work	Its 80 divided by 10	3.0
Is it 810 plus 20100	Yes	0.0
If you add 13  13 how much is that	Yes	0.0
Were doing a whole class but thank you for checking	Youre welcome	0.0
I want you to be listening for some key words that he says	I have the half because I know that  is 12 and then Ill get the third because the  its 13 each	4.0
I have the half because I know that  is 12 and then Ill get the third because the  its 13 each	Then I found out that 1 13 would cover 12 and I know that 23 is not half	4.0
Olivia	More than	3.0
Can you explain what you did there	I know that the other side is 12 and then I said it cant fit because theyll go over the half and it wouldnt fit because we only have 12 left	4.0
Youre on The Price Is Right up now	The Price Is Right	0.0
Owen can you share what really you could do	If we got it or if the	2.0

How much is 26	13	3.0
What would I have to do	A common denominator	3.0
Is 815 more or less than 12	More	3.0
Ryan what are you thinking	What you could do then is do that	4.0
What you could do then is do that	Then just split it fairly among the two other sisters	4.0
Then just split it fairly among the two other sisters	Yes those	4.0
What are these	Fourths	3.0
How much	The other half	3.0
Logan	The oldest daughter gets more than the two sisters	3.0
I have your paper right here	I knew that the oldest daughter got 12 and the two younger daughters got  13 so I have both 12 right here	4.0
I knew that the oldest daughter got 12 and the two younger daughters got  13 so I have both 12 right here	This was 1 12s right here	4.0
This was 1 12s right here	Instead of dividing it by 3 right here I  and I knew that this was 12	4.0
Instead of dividing it by 3 right here I  and I knew that this was 12	When I did these two right here and I knew that these two daughters could share this	4.0
When I did these two right here and I knew that these two daughters could share this	I thought that they would get 16	4.0
The other two would get 16	Yes	0.0
What color is the 16 piece	I think its blue	3.0
Blue	Light blue	3.0
Youre doing a little advice thinking here	No Im confused	2.0
Youre confused	Yes	0.0
If she has 12 to share is there enough Were using too much land here	No because I wanted both of them here	3.0
You want this	Yes	0.0
Does that anymore	Left over	3.0
Well how much is left over	There would be 15	3.0
Were almost done	Maybe instead of you doing Where did you	0.0
Well does this work	No	0.0
Why not	Because this isnt	0.0
Can you explain what you did	I tried a couple of different things  it will get 12 because turning your fraction into equivalent	4.0
Did you get that somewhere	No	0.0
What denominator did you use	30	4.0
30	These turn to 5 and then these ones	4.0
If I write them out like this what denominator did you use	I used 30	3.0
What do you end up with	You get 6 x	3.0
Mia can you share	When I first started out I thought that the oldest daughter will get 13 and the other two will get 18	4.0
When I first started out I thought that the oldest daughter will get 13 and the other two will get 18	When we started to do the equation we found thats not	4.0

What did you think Asher	Nothing can fit in	3.0
Annabelle	Well I was revising my thinking	0.0
Were you	Yes	0.0
Can you explain what that is	Its one third and I figured out this entire angle was one third by just placing it	4.0
Owen	Can I take my paper	0.0
What if you use the yellow one	I already	0.0
This is how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle	I said there can only fit one because you cant put another one or because itd have to be half if there was another one	4.0
What kind of angle is this and how do you know	about like angle	0.0
about like angle	Right now I just want to say that the inside is  when youre saying yellow here  here its just very adjustable to the sun	3.0

Owen can I borrow someones paper with a yellow	Here	0.0
Can we tell what kind of angle this is	Obtuse	3.0
Dan	I can explain because that makes about a right angle and this is  angle	4.0
What did he say Zoe	He said the other one is also obtuse because its more than 90 degrees	4.0

Then be prepared to share what you agree with and what you dont agree with and how could we revise it	I didnt really understand because I wasnt here for these parts	2.0
Do you want to share what you got or how did you do it	What I did was The principal has several questions for	0.0
What does the question say	I saw how much more of would it costs to hire tumblers and a singing group	4.0
I saw how much more of would it costs to hire tumblers and a singing group	What I did is that I circled both of these and then I circled whats inside the row	4.0
What I did is that I circled both of these and then I circled whats inside the row	I did 22 plus 16	4.0
I did 22 plus 16	Then I had 78	4.0
It takes a lot	What I was doing for right here was I was using it so that I could do the multiplication and get it through	4.0
What I was doing for right here was I was using it so that I could do the multiplication and get it through	I took it from right here	4.0
I took it from right here	How I did to get my estimate was I just noticed that this cant really be estimated except for this one	4.0
How I did to get my estimate was I just noticed that this cant really be estimated except for this one	This one can be estimated	4.0
Go ahead	What I was doing here was I was doing the multiplication square thing basically	4.0
What I was doing here was I was doing the multiplication square thing basically	Then after I got all those I started adding them up so that I could get my answer which is 528	4.0
Looking at this When you look at the tumblers and singing group what did you multiply	I did the tumblers	3.0
Tell me what you multiplied for tumblers	I did eight times three which is 24 and then I took this put it right here and then I put the 20 in the four over here	4.0
I did eight times three which is 24 and then I took this put it right here and then I put the 20 in the four over here	Then I started adding them up	4.0
What youre saying is you did basically eight times three is 24 and you multiplied by 22	Yes	0.0
Did you do the same thing for the other one	No I didnt have the time	0.0
Who has something Do you guys agree with that	Yes	1.0
Dylan	Because he added the eight performers and hours of entertainment and got 24	4.0
Because he added the eight performers and hours of entertainment and got 24	Then did 22 hours times three because Put that down there and then he got He added them and got 528	4.0
Move your clip up	What I did is before I did my problems I multiplied the first column times the cost	4.0
What I did is before I did my problems I multiplied the first column times the cost	Here I multiplied the cost and the number for quantity and I figured out that the same group was 48 because this one doesnt say it would do the hours	4.0
Here I multiplied the cost and the number for quantity and I figured out that the same group was 48 because this one doesnt say it would do the hours	I would add in the hours if it said like packages or hours	4.0
Owen	I agree and disagree because when I did this I added and I multiplied 8X22 then I did that answer from	1.0
I have one friend who did 8X3 then did times 16 is it the same thing if you 8X22 Oh sorry Ive put the wrong one	8X3	3.0
Its true Logan why would I get the same answer doing it this way or this way	Because theyre basically the same number we just did a different order	4.0
Right now when were looking at this did everybody bring a pencil	Yes	0.0
When we hear how much more what do you automatically think in your head how much more	Subtraction	3.0
Owen what are we multiplying	I did 63X3	3.0
For the singing	Yes	0.0
Can you explain how you got 63	I did 4X16 then I did that times 3	4.0
Would that work	Yes	1.0
Would it be possible to keep it as three	Yes	0.0
Could you still do it easily in your head	Yes	0.0
What can we round to	keep it as four	3.0
Why would that make it easy in your head Dan	Because 4X5 is 20	4.0
Can everybody do 20X20	Yes	0.0
Now show me with your fingers is it making more sense	Yes	0.0
Can I have a friend read that out loud Julia can you please read it	How much would it cost to buy the burritos and the sandwiches	0.0
What key words did you hear	How much	3.0
When I hear and in my head Im thinking Im going to subtract or add at the end	Add	3.0
Put it under that camera and compare yours to Julias to see if you agree or disagree and why	For this one I did 13X3 equals 39 theyre the burritos and then I did 18X6 up here and I equaled 108	4.0
For this one I did 13X3 equals 39 theyre the burritos and then I did 18X6 up here and I equaled 108	That was for sandwiches	4.0
That was for sandwiches	For the sandwiches	4.0
Can we label the sandwiches	Then I did 100 andthen I added wait	3.0
Did you add these two numbers	What I did was I did  and then I did 18	0.0
What I did was I did  and then I did 18	Then I got 857	3.0
Then I got 857	Because	0.0
Are you doing a little revising right now	No Im not supposed to have the eight here I dont know how you do that	2.0
No Im not supposed to have the eight here I dont know how you do that	I got 57	3.0
Can you explain how you got 57	I dont think it was right but I did a I thought that I was going to do 39 and 108X39 but then I just realized that doesnt equal 57 that	4.0
Look at your own	What I did is so this is for the burritos	0.0
What I did is so this is for the burritos	I did 8X3 which is 8X3	3.0
No down here	The 8 times and the 3 because theres eight	4.0
The 8 times and the 3 because theres eight	Theres 3 for each	4.0
Okay	so I do that and then I did times 13 because there may be 13 packages	4.0
so I do that and then I did times 13 because there may be 13 packages	Then for the sandwiches I did 3X18 because 5X6 is 30 and then times 18 because there was 18 packages	4.0
Whatd you get for your answer	81500	3.0
What did you get	852	3.0
Was anyone thinking something at the beginning but now you realized what Sebastian do you want to share	Yes well at first I thought that you would include the hour but now that Ive seen everyone come up and	1.0
Riley Riley not right now	explain their answers I figured out that you have to add the hours	1.0

Area	It said that one side was nine	3.0
Dan	Something I would like to add is we have the area	1.0
I think youre so on target	multiply the	3.0
Sebastian	When you target the area and the  the area and basically divide	4.0
When you target the area and the  the area and basically divide	Then if theres a zero on that area you act on the  just like yesterday but it involves a shape	4.0
Then if theres a zero on that area you act on the  just like yesterday but it involves a shape	Its basically a division problem from yesterday but just with the rectangle	4.0

My God	Okay guys lets go get these so that we can add things	0.0
Okay guys lets go get these so that we can add things	No so Victoria what did you think for the first problem	2.0
No so Victoria what did you think for the first problem	Okay so what I did for the first problems I did 29  31  27  67 then I knew since we wanted it at least five oranges in each basket	4.0
Okay so what I did for the first problems I did 29  31  27  67 then I knew since we wanted it at least five oranges in each basket	Five five different I did 67   5 and I knew there is 50  after that I would say  67  10 to go on the side and I did 67 subtract 50 and I had 70 and I put  five into the 17 plus I could have got I put it even so I  1572	4.0
Five five different I did 67   5 and I knew there is 50  after that I would say  67  10 to go on the side and I did 67 subtract 50 and I had 70 and I put  five into the 17 plus I could have got I put it even so I  1572	That 13	4.0
That 13	I respectfully disagree because I think your addition is wrong because 31  2927 I just said is	1.0
Okay Steven what did you get	87	3.0
Okay so can you see if you can find your mistake do you think theres a mistake	I find the 30 40 50 60 70	3.0
I find the 30 40 50 60 70	Yes	1.0
Okay good and so with her addition being off do you think it threw everything else off	Yes	0.0
Okay so well give you a second to fix that and so basically on A I like how youve explained how you divided did everybody divide to get an answer okay when you divided what did you get	I got 17 or maybe	3.0
17	I got 17	3.0
I got 17	It says if you didnt  some baskets are 17 and theres any extra  plus five so I took two out of the 17 or put one in each so the two of them are 16 and 15 in each one	4.0
Okay Steven can you share what we did here with the picture	What we did is we brought out 95	3.0
Group of five so we drew out groups of five to show and model all the bags so each one of five	I added one and two of them	3.0
When you did your revised thinking what did you come up with for your answer	17 and then again a remainder	3.0
With those extra remainders what did you guys do with them	I went for	0.0
Excellent and so thinking about interpreting remainders what did you guys do with those	We spread them out	3.0
Okay so now lets go to B	I said there will be 15 baskets	3.0
Can you explain how you did that Owen	Because we provide	0.0
Oh explain what you did Victoria	I drew  with two baskets of six and four baskets office	3.0
I drew  with two baskets of six and four baskets office	I still dont get this	2.0
Hopefully your group can help you	Theyre trying but I still think its wrong	1.0
Owen you just went right to what	The second	3.0
What was your equation that you did	17 divided by seven equals two and	4.0
Could you divide out the 17 baskets if seven go in each box	I could	3.0
Are you saying you would need three boxes	Yes	0.0
Would that third box be full	It would only have three	3.0
Can you read what you wrote on number three	I use the remainder of the problem one because I divided 87 by five and got 17 remainder two	4.0
I use the remainder of the problem one because I divided 87 by five and got 17 remainder two	I put two baskets that had six oranges so that there was no remainder	4.0
I put two baskets that had six oranges so that there was no remainder	I used remainders of problem two because there would be two boxes but I cant leave any out so I had to add one extra box for the remaining oranges	4.0
Your explanation because I thought you did a good job of explaining it	Sure	0.0
Do you guys have anything else you want to add on	No	0.0
What	My explanation	0.0
Okay and so how about I give you guys a couple of minutes to add on and the only thing Owen that might so you get the division but over here when it shows show or explain your thinking can you do a little explanation to go with it	Okay	0.0

How about Sebastian who was your partner	Owen	0.0
Hey did you guys come up with the same answer as Owen	Yes we came up with 48 and the blue one was the one that weighed more and it weighed more by 48 but we did a different problem	3.0
All right and everybody  down here	What I did was when I saw that 28  I first thought it will be the black ones because I saw all that red and I thought it would be one fraction first for the blue one and I saw except Im reading it and I found that the blue one but I didnt know how many patterns  once more	4.0
What I did was when I saw that 28  I first thought it will be the black ones because I saw all that red and I thought it would be one fraction first for the blue one and I saw except Im reading it and I found that the blue one but I didnt know how many patterns  once more	So I did my number model and I wasnt sure what type of model I was going to do so I did this first so I can get my answer and know that I could do my model and get the right answer so I do my two and 18 and I subtracted my one and 58 I subtracted by four then five	4.0
I want you to stand up if you did something similar to Sebastian and Sebastian can you explain what you did here with the you took one  98	Because I know that I can subtract 18 minus 58 so I took one over here then made it eight eights and the  because I can subtract the 58	4.0
All right Owen can you come up and share and I want you to compare what you did compared to Sebastian	I did the same thing with Sebastian I took away one of them to make 28 because  subtract 18 from 58	4.0
I did the same thing with Sebastian I took away one of them to make 28 because  subtract 18 from 58	This is the blue backpack theres one pound two pounds and one eight minus one pound and five eights and then	4.0

Ryan can you go ahead and bring yours up	The first thing that I did was I did  then I did minus 10	3.0
What youre saying is you did 10 14  D is 11 and you knew that 14  34 gives you 1 to make 11	Yes	0.0
Why did you change it to subtraction	because we already had 11	4.0
Maybe you did a little differently so Maddy can you share what you did	No  so I started off with 10 and 14 because I  off with and then I looked at it and I thought it was one then I worked with 1 and 34 because I was just added up like yours I got 11	4.0
What did you realize about this	Well I realized that it was wrong to me  because that wasnt cool	3.0
Bless you Emma	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	I did  and one was minus 10 one was because 11 people say  and then	4.0

The thing is you doing it out of order right	Do what	2.0
What does this say	Yes yes	0.0
Yes yes	Sorry my bad	0.0
Sorry my bad	My mistake	0.0
All right guys you can start getting things cleaned up	So when you re finding Xintercepts and these both cancel would it just be zero	3.0
So when you re finding Xintercepts and these both cancel would it just be zero	And that is just	0.0
Just a straight line because there s no just continuities  in the denominator other than a hole right	Yes	0.0
Asymptote	Does it have to cross the hole	3.0
So you have still plug that holein figure out the	But then how do you get	2.0
The hole doesn t have to be at the xaxis	Oh yes	0.0
Oh yes	Into Negative 15	3.0
You plug the hole in there you get  looks like that	So you want xintercept yintercept  horizontal asymptote	3.0
For this one the  behavior is a  what has the relative figure power numerator versus denominator	So if the	0.0
If the denominator wins it s a horizontal asymptote of zero	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Right	0.0
Good morning class	Hi	0.0
What is this trying to get across to you	That in 1999 there was a house price like the price	3.0
Say something intelligent  about this	I said  The houses in 1999 were made way more expensive	3.0
All right what increased	The average house price	3.0
The average house price	2000	1.0
2000	Yes it increased by 2000	1.0
Yes it increased by 2000	And average price by 10000	3.0
And average price by 10000	It increased a lot	1.0
All right tell me something intelligent about this	In 1999 it was	3.0
Is there anything wrong with this	Does that say 80000	3.0
Is there anything misleading about it	By 2000	3.0
By 2000	Yes	0.0
Yes	Wait	0.0
2000	But why	2.0
All right tell me something about this	It shows the average increase in the house prices No sorry	3.0
It shows the average increase in the house prices No sorry	It shows the increase of the average house pricing from 1998 to 1999	3.0
Is there anything misleading or weird about this graph	Yes	0.0
What	increase	3.0
It looks like it right	Yes theres a gap	3.0
Mr Strathom Actually I dont talk about	Yes well we picked	0.0
I cant try to talk you into  Its better just to  Remember you can do this really easy by just putting in L1	Well yes	0.0
Well yes	I could do that too	0.0
Im going to do this too	Am I doing this right	0.0
Am I doing this right	Standard deviation	3.0
Whats happening	Everything was the same	3.0
What happened from original to  in general the	So is  40	3.0
Tell me what happened	Theyre the same	3.0
What happened with the measures of center	S	0.0
By what	10	3.0
What happened with the measures of spread	They were the same	3.0
What happened to the measures of center when I gave everybody 10 extra points	They raised	3.0
By	10	3.0
The goal is could you have predicted this without putting it into your calculator based on the story	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
What did I basically do to everybodys data	Increase 10 points	3.0
What was the range	30	3.0
What was the IQR	20	3.0
What was the standard deviation	104	3.0
Now when I gave everybody or they retook the test and everybody did 10 points better what happened to the range	It was 30	3.0
What happened to the IQR	20	3.0
What happened is the standard deviation	104	3.0
Can I summarize what you said	Go ahead	0.0
Did my hands get further apart	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	1.0
Did I increase the spread	No	0.0
What do your measures of spread do	Stay the same	3.0
See if you come to those conclusions	Do the mean	3.0
Itll be slightly different so make sure youre actually calculating it and looking at the numbers	Whats the mean	2.0
The median went from 355 to	71	3.0
When they doubled their scores ladies When they doubled their scores ladies when they doubled their scores did the mean of their data double	Yes	0.0
Those all did this but did these do that	No	0.0
They went like this	They did not move	3.0
Did they spread out	No	0.0
Did they move up	Yes	0.0
Yes	In my experience of looking at these two charts the first one where you add up the range the standard deviation didnt change but the range	3.0
Everybody got how many extra credit points	10	3.0
They went up by	10	3.0
Youre just figuring that out	Two	3.0
If you took a quiz and you all got 10 on it and I tripled your score youd all get what	30	3.0
30 and the spread would also get multiplied by three but in that case I guess if you all got 10 our spread would be zero	we did very good	0.0
Youre ready	No	0.0

Thats not a problem	Its not equal	3.0
These count by what	10s	3.0
Can you do that	No	0.0
Ill tell you when you guys get to math four in calculus youll learn that it is legal to do that as long as you tell people that its logarithmic	What is that	2.0
In math one if somebody gives you that graph theyre lying to you and you cant	Cant do that	3.0

Yes	What zero	2.0
Zero is where it hits zero so it s below zero from here back it s not below zero from here till	greater than	3.0
What if we made it instead of a strict inequality we made it something like  or	We could put brackets instead	3.0
It wouldn t change these	It would change those over there	3.0
It wouldn t change those because it can t hit the  so it would only change this one so that would change that because it does hit zero	the bracket and set them up	3.0

You seriously know a lot of math things like do you know how to factor	Yes	0.0
If you see something that looks like it could be factorable should you maybe think about factoring it	Maybe	0.0
Should you being afraid that its not the right thing keep you from trying it	No	0.0
Do you know how to simplify and distribute	Yes	0.0
Will you by the time this test comes around in about three weeks know a whole bunch of equivalent identities that you could substitute in	Yes	0.0
If you know this you could rearrange	You see the cosine is equal to the sine and the sine is equal to the cosine which is equal to 10 and if 10 is equal to cosine and a tangent then the tangent or the sine and the cosine go to the sine and tangent and the sine or the tangent goes to the cosine	4.0
You see the cosine is equal to the sine and the sine is equal to the cosine which is equal to 10 and if 10 is equal to cosine and a tangent then the tangent or the sine and the cosine go to the sine and tangent and the sine or the tangent goes to the cosine	Sine tangent	4.0
Sine tangent	You see it shows the tangent of the sine when you show the tangent of the sine the sine of the tangent is shown	4.0
Yes do you want to do it	Sure	0.0
It will make sense	When you look at your Pythagorean identities 1   sin2    cos2    cos2   x tan2    sin2   which is also 1 cos2	4.0
When you look at your Pythagorean identities 1   sin2    cos2    cos2   x tan2    sin2   which is also 1 cos2	That changes to 1 cos2	4.0
That changes to 1 cos2	We also know that tan  sincos and so you can say  is equal to sin cos   2	4.0
Dont do the big theta do a little theta here and a little theta there	Okay all right	0.0
Does anybody have any question for Callie about what shes done so far	Why are you doing	1.0
Piper	I thought the cos2   would be positive not negative because if it were 1 cos2   then it would be	4.0
Why is that not turn into a negative cos2   is that what youre asking	Have you thought about the other way in  sin2	1.0
Have you thought about the other way in  sin2	1   cos2   would be 1 cos2	0.0
You should have an identity on your sheet that says cos2    1   sin2	Why did you do it	2.0
Everything is right up here so far	Yes	1.0
Okay keep going	Then what I did	0.0
Then what I did	This cos   cos2   and youre multiplying they just cancel out	4.0
This cos   cos2   and youre multiplying they just cancel out	Im just going to write this up here	4.0

So here is place oh Alexander go ahead	could you make the body	3.0
In my math monster	The next step is to make you already have a body	3.0
The next step is to make you already have a body	So you already have an arm right	3.0
Oh do we	actually no	0.0
actually no	the next step after the body is the arm	3.0

Im not going to give you longer than one minute because we should be copying this down already	T	0.0
Yes Keily	When are we going to go over the answer of the of what was your mistake on the one photo	0.0
is my head there	kind of	0.0
Do We have a question	I have a question	2.0
Okay	Um my question is how do you come up with the number like two times one equals	2.0
Does that make sense or no	Yeah that makes sense	0.0
Alexander	I dont understand how you got like the body equations	2.0
So 80 times 6 and nine times 6	That makes sense now	0.0
Any other questions about where or how Ive gotten where I am	My question is are my sums correct	0.0
Are what correct	My sums I got for eight times six	0.0
Matteo can you tell me what your answer is and how you got it	I got 480 Because I did eight times six which equaled 80 and then just added zero	4.0
You mean equals 48	Yeah	0.0
Nine times six is what Margo	9 times 6 is 54	4.0
Okay so nine times six equals 54	T I have a question	2.0
What is your question	Like is it doesnt matter which order you do it	3.0
Like is it doesnt matter which order you do it	can you like do like six and then you like find Nine	3.0
So the next step would be to do the leg which is just 480 plus 54	isnt an arm	3.0
So the arm was our answers right here	Oh ok	0.0
If I try to add these lined up like this is this gonna give me the answer	No	0.0
But is that is that a very different answer from my 534	Yeah	0.0
when youre done I want you to double check your answers	T your cameras kind of shaking	0.0
Can you say that	yeah 120	3.0
Okay how do you know Laura	I know that because two times six equals 12	4.0
I know that because two times six equals 12	And then theres one zero so you just add that one zero	4.0
50 times five Royce	Im gonna get up	0.0
Im gonna get up	Oh can I get a Can you skip me for now	0.0
Lets go to lets go to Kurt T Kurt  t 50 times five		3.0
How do you know	We do five times five which would equal 25	4.0
We do five times five which would equal 25	And then we add a zero	4.0
Royce 40 times		3.0
Are you sure	I mean 320	3.0
Ah okay Royce can you explain to me why its to 320 and not 360	Because I took off the zero and put in my answer	4.0
Because I took off the zero and put in my answer	And then I did four times eight	4.0
And then I did four times eight	Um so I know two times 8 is 16 in there too	4.0
Um so I know two times 8 is 16 in there too	So I added 16 and another 16	4.0
So I added 16 and another 16	I got I got 32 and then I put in my answer and just add the zero	4.0
Nice so you use repeated addition to figure out four times eight	Yep	0.0
Scarlett 400 times six	Wait	0.0
Ah		3.0
Oh 2400 How do you know that River	You take two and like you take two of it like two sixes then you do like you push them together thats 800 then you can just do like eight times three because then you only have to do it two more times	4.0
And it even tells you the mathematical problem down at the bottom	Yeah My mom made me practice this website last summer so Id know my multiplication	0.0
Are there questions about the multiplication chart	Nope I know how to use it now	0.0
Any other questions	Are these supposed to be a trick question	0.0
Are these supposed to be a trick question	Are you supposed to add them up afterwards	3.0
Um Mari and Lucas T Mari and Lucas t What do you guys talk about	We talked about the problem	3.0
Mari can you share the strategy that you and Lucas t were using	We started doing basic division and then we got the answer of 120	3.0
Okay so can you explain to me what you mean by when you say um we started using basic division	But we asked each other like how many times is 0 going to nine and we both said zero	4.0
But we asked each other like how many times is 0 going to nine and we both said zero	then we asked ourselves how many times does 4 go into nine twice	4.0
then we asked ourselves how many times does 4 go into nine twice	And then we asked ourselves How many times is five go into 9	4.0
And then we asked ourselves How many times is five go into 9	Once	4.0
Once	So thats how we got the answer of 120	4.0
So with this so Mari and Lucas T Did you guys have any equation to solve this problem	Yes we did	0.0
What was the equation Mari	540 divided by nine	3.0
Did anyone else find this equation	Kurt T didnt Kurt thaI was with didnt talk at all	0.0
Why did you come up with 540 divided by 9	Because we read the problem	4.0
Because we read the problem	We found our two big numbers	4.0
We found our two big numbers	And then were like Okay how do we put this and then we knew it couldnt be multiplication addition or subtraction	4.0
And then were like Okay how do we put this and then we knew it couldnt be multiplication addition or subtraction	So then we just 540 divided by nine	4.0
How many bags Are there a nine cartons		3.0
Can anyone hear me	I can hear you	0.0
I can hear you	I can hear you	0.0
Okay thats good	Yeah I can hear you	0.0
Can you say that again	I didnt say anything	0.0
I didnt say anything	I just asked if you stopped sharing	0.0
Or to think about it	I did	0.0
Okay Marcos can you explain to us how	I went up by 10s Because I went up by 10s and ones in each scarf	4.0
I went up by 10s Because I went up by 10s and ones in each scarf	And when I got to 60 times nine I got the answer of 540	4.0
Marcos so far	Yes	0.0
Yes	So Ill try 10s	4.0
So Ill try 10s	And then I tried it until I got to nine	4.0
And then I tried it until I got to nine	In the like 9 times 16	4.0
Its on the chat	I can still hear you	0.0
How many would that be		3.0
What is it		3.0
If 60 times nine equals 540 540 divided by nine equals what		3.0
		1.0
		1.0
Dakota can you start at the top and read out loud	Yes	0.0
Yes	The US Department of agriculture	0.0
agriculture	agriculture conducts surveys to find out how much how out how much food Americans eat	0.0
agriculture conducts surveys to find out how much how out how much food Americans eat	Average they asked a large number of people to keep lists of all their food I ate over a period of seven several days	0.0
Average they asked a large number of people to keep lists of all their food I ate over a period of seven several days	These lists these lists are then used to estimate how much of each food they add in during the year Americans eat an average of 2000 pounds per food year food per year that this is about five halfs five and a half	0.0
These lists these lists are then used to estimate how much of each food they add in during the year Americans eat an average of 2000 pounds per food year food per year that this is about five halfs five and a half	Five and a half pounds of food per year	0.0
Five and a half pounds of food per year	The the most current results show that Americans eat or drink about following average amount of food foods in one year	0.0
Does any of this information surprise anybody	It surprises me	0.0
Can you explain more about that Kaylee	It surprises me because we have like a lot of food in his house	4.0
It surprises me because we have like a lot of food in his house	But I didnt know that like other people went through that much food	4.0
Kole What do you think	i agree with Kaylee	1.0
Kole	I agree with Camille	1.0
Can you tell me why	Because like how do you eat that much per day or per year	0.0
Anybody else	It surprises me	3.0
Why does it surprise you Dakota	Because we because most every day I eat three meals and three meals I feel is like a good amount	4.0
Because we because most every day I eat three meals and three meals I feel is like a good amount	But 2000 pounds seems like a lot to me	4.0
But 2000 pounds seems like a lot to me	And its just like Did I really eat that much food	0.0
Do you think that every year people eat 2000 pounds of food per year	No	0.0
No	I think that it changes	3.0
I see you in the chat	I think they can change because if they see this they can be like Oh Im eating too much	4.0
I think they can change because if they see this they can be like Oh Im eating too much	I need to eat less and then theyll eat less	4.0
What do you think	I think that it changes because for adults	4.0
I think that it changes because for adults	since were kids our bellies arent that big	4.0
since were kids our bellies arent that big	How adults are	4.0
How adults are	Theyre Bigger	4.0
Okay so are you saying Paige that adults eat more than children	I think so	0.0
Okay does anyone agree with Paige	I disagree	1.0
I disagree	I agree	1.0
Miriam can you explain why you agree	Because my brother eats more than me now and my parents so I agree	4.0
Um Lia you said you disagree	I disagree because since were growing children I think that we eat more than adults do on a daily average basic but it feels like when adults are eating more than then what we eat just because were actually getting more protein and nutrition because we just who still growing children	4.0
Dakota what do you think	I feel like Im average the word average means like like if like like they like the average is like when like the normal person likes eats food or something	3.0
So does it mean that every single American every single person that lives in this country eats two and a half pounds of food per day	No	0.0
No	the average that means like it can like keeping up my average	3.0
the average that means like it can like keeping up my average	What did you say	0.0
What did you say	Two and a half pounds or 2000 pounds	2.0
I said five and a half pounds per day	I dont think so	0.0
Do you think that you and everyone in your family or everyone in your community everybody in our school everybody in our class Do you think that everybody eats five and a half pounds per day	No	0.0
No	no	1.0
no	Maybe maybe not	0.0
Why do you say no	I say no because like sometimes like if theyre sick maybe they dont want to eat so much food	4.0
I say no because like sometimes like if theyre sick maybe they dont want to eat so much food	And like if theyre just not feeling like eating they dont eat	4.0
Alright Paige	The most current results show show that America  eats or drinks about the following averages amounts of these foods in one year	0.0
Now what mathematical equation would we use To find out how many pounds of bananas the students in our class would eat	I think I know	0.0
Tell me	25 times 25 equals	3.0
How would we do that	I think I know	0.0
Haven how would you round 25	I would look at the ones place and then see see if its bigger than four	4.0
I would look at the ones place and then see see if its bigger than four	And if its bigger for the I round it up to 30	4.0
Mason do you agree	I disagree	1.0
Mason tell me why you disagree	Because if we do what we can just do 25 plus another 25 will equal 50	4.0
Because if we do what we can just do 25 plus another 25 will equal 50	But we still need 24 more of them	4.0
But we still need 24 more of them	So equal bit more than what she said	4.0
Four or less just ignore five or more	add one more	3.0
Okay now I dont really want to around the kids in our class because if I say that we have about 30 kids in our class is that accurate	No	0.0
Is this a little bit easier to solve than 25 times 25	Yes	0.0
Yes	yes	1.0
Can you give me a strategy of how Im going to solve 30 times 25	the way To solve it by separating it like that like three times two equals six	4.0
Evie can I do that	yes	0.0
Can I do that	Yes you can Because thats the problem	4.0
Yes you can Because thats the problem	30 times 25 so three times two equals six and zero times five equals zero	4.0
hey what does someone else think	Wait no I think I think 6	3.0
Haven why can we not do that	we cannot do that because we have to do 30 times 25	4.0
So Haven how would you solve 30 times 25	I will start with 30	3.0
I will start with 30	And keep on doing that	3.0
And keep on doing that	I start with 30	3.0
I start with 30	And do it 25 times	3.0
If anyone thinks that they have a faster way I want you to speak up	I do	0.0
Mason you think you have a faster way than me writing 30 25 times	Yes	0.0
Because I would like to save my energy	We can do three times two which will equal six and do zero times five which will just equal five so we can just add them to numbers	4.0
Does my answer of 60 makes sense	No	0.0
No	it really doesnt	3.0
So who has another way that I could try this	I have another way	0.0
And then lets go to Dakota	Okay so I thought of another way	0.0
Okay so I thought of another way	Like you could like count your zeros first	4.0
Like you could like count your zeros first	And then you could do 30 times five and then 30 times two	4.0
So what sounds like to me Camille is that youre breaking up your your 25	Yeah	0.0
what are you breaking up your 25 into	20 and five and then you could go over 30 20 times and then go over five with 3 30 time with ya 30 20 times and then five times	4.0
30 times 20 and 30 times five	Yes	0.0
Yes	Because you have to count your zeros	4.0
Because you have to count your zeros	Which you have two zeros	4.0
Which you have two zeros	And then you need to count your your and then you do times two times three which will get you six so your answer would be 600	4.0
And then you need to count your your and then you do times two times three which will get you six so your answer would be 600	And then for the second one 30 times five you have to capture zero to equal 150 because three times five equals 15	4.0
And then for the second one 30 times five you have to capture zero to equal 150 because three times five equals 15	Now all you need to do is add them up and then that will be a final answer	4.0
All right so adding those up who can help me out what would 600 times 150 be	150	3.0
150	wait you said	0.0
Itll be what		3.0
How many eggs does the average American eat a year		3.0
So how many about how many eggs would the family have four each year	I just did the math and I think I have an answer	0.0
Dean what do you need buddy	I was going to say that isnt pizza Italian	0.0
Is that related to what were talking about right now	No	0.0
Now which of these two numbers makes more sense to estimate to make it into an easier number to work with	Would it be 249 turning into 250	3.0
Forrest	She rounded	1.0
She rounded	Um to the nearest 10 Because the nine is more than five	4.0
Do you think that he did what you did	Yeah he did	1.0
is 250 times four a little bit easier to figure out	I think so Because its like a number with a zero at the end	4.0
Can you tell me more about that	Um 250 has a zero at the end	3.0
Um 250 has a zero at the end	And I feel like that would be easier to work with	3.0
Do you guys think I can use my zero role to solve this problem	Yeah	0.0
Oh there you are	You take away inaudibleand put on your answer	3.0
Then what Evie	Count by five four times	3.0
Does anybody know a piece of money that equals 25	I do	0.0
I do	four quarters equals 1 so thats 100 pennies Each	4.0
four quarters equals 1 so thats 100 pennies Each	Four times is 100	4.0
So four of them equals 1 and 1 is equal to how many cents		3.0
		1.0
So what is 250 times four		3.0
Crosstalk	You need to attract one to get your answer for the	3.0
Well what would I need to Subtract from this to get 249 might times four	minus four	3.0
minus four	You need to subract four	1.0
Yes I need to subtract four	Which would equal 9996 or 996	3.0
Give me a green checkmark when you have your numbers out in front of you	Can I take a guess what were gonna do with the numbers	0.0
Sure	I think that we are going to times number by one	4.0
I think that we are going to times number by one	So we know how and then well divide them into pounds	4.0
So we know how and then well divide them into pounds	So we know how many pounds we ate or drink the last seven days a week	4.0
Fatima Whats up	I put zero for eggs because Im allergic to eggs	0.0
Does anybody know how many weeks there are in a year	I know that there are 360 days in a year	3.0
I know that there are 360 days in a year	is this 70 weeks a year	1.0
is this 70 weeks a year	Because 4 divided by 12 or 12 divided by four	4.0
So in 100 weeks how many pieces of candy is T going to eat		3.0
		1.0
How many eggs Am I going to eat in two years	Zero	3.0
All right how many cups of milk		3.0
		1.0
And Im going to call on some sticks for people to share	Ms Cornish Can I add all my numbers up	0.0
After youre done solving all three of those	Im already done	0.0
Okay Im gonna give you about 30 more seconds	inauidble  you see me at lunch Im probably gonna have a big giant salad on a nice plate	0.0
inauidble  you see me at lunch Im probably gonna have a big giant salad on a nice plate	Oh when I multiplied my milk I guess Im gonna drink a lot of Milk	0.0
How many cups of milk Are you going to drink in two years	Its not technically cups	3.0
Its not technically cups	Its gallons	3.0
How many gallons of milk Are you going to drink in two years		3.0
Charlie do you drink a lot of milk every week	Yeah	0.0
So try not to share zero try to share a number which one of these how many pieces of candy milk or eggs are you going to eat in a year	I would eat 7000 pieces of candy Because	3.0
Over 2 years	Which one	2.0
Which one	Which one is the two years of candy because I am confused	2.0
times 100 is two years because you eat I seven pieces of candy a week and theres 100 weeks in two years	So I would 700 pieces of candy over the span of two years	3.0
Hunter you got five seconds to unmute	two	3.0
two what	Are we looking at the answer	0.0
Sure are yup	Okay let me	0.0
two glasses of milk or two pieces of candy	I ate two pieces I just ste Oh I eat in a week	0.0
I ate two pieces I just ste Oh I eat in a week	I usually eat like about five eggs because I like eggs	0.0
Okay	I drink like six glasses like maybe seven glasses of milk	0.0
I drink like six glasses like maybe seven glasses of milk	And I usually only eat like three pieces of candy	0.0
And I usually only eat like three pieces of candy	So now	0.0
all right Hunter	cuz Im pretty healthy	0.0
Hunter Im still talking to you buddy		3.0
500 Hunter Did you know that you could eat 500 eggs	Um no I did not	0.0
Kelly please unmute and talk to us	Okay	0.0
Can you tell us	Im not sure	2.0
Eggs milk or candy	Eggs	0.0
How many eggs do you eat	5	0.0
What am I gonna multiply by		3.0
Or what we know about area	Um area is like how many squares are in a shape	3.0
Um area is like how many squares are in a shape	Can I add on	1.0
Absolutely Sarah	area is kind of like you need to find like the inside of a shape the perimeter of the outside of the shape	3.0
area is kind of like you need to find like the inside of a shape the perimeter of the outside of the shape	And then you need to multiply your your area and perimeter to get your answer	4.0
And then you need to multiply your your area and perimeter to get your answer	Good	4.0
Go ahead and mute please	Sorry	0.0
So now if I have a two by four rectangle how many squares Am I going to have in the inside of my shape	Eight	3.0
June how do you know that	Four times two is 8 and two times four is 8	4.0
Cadence give me a two digit number please		0.0
And Franc give me another two digit number please		0.0
I know that in expanded form what is 50		3.0
someone other than June	90 and 9	3.0
Follow me so far	Yes inauidbel	0.0
Yes inauidbel	Im confused why you put the lines	2.0
Say again Sarah	Im confused why you put the lines	2.0
What is this side going to equal	0	3.0
0	9	1.0
Who said nine	Me	0.0
Michael Why is it nine	Because if its in the one its in the ones place	4.0
So what other sides equal nine	The top	3.0
The top	Um is it Is it the small box	1.0
Okay so can we figure out what the inside of this square equals	Yes	0.0
Yes	yeah	1.0
So what does the inside of this square equal	Nine	3.0
Nine	nine	1.0
Why	It equals nine because it is Technically just zero time nine	4.0
And what is zero times 9		3.0
Are you sure		3.0
	Sorry 0	1.0
Which one should we look at next	Crosstalk	0.0
How would I find what the inside of this square equals	multiplying 50 times nine which equals 450	4.0
Sarah can you explain how you got that	Which one	0.0
Which one	how I got the equation or the answer	0.0
both	I got the equation because I was looking at the numbers	4.0
I got the equation because I was looking at the numbers	So I knew that it had to be 50 times nine	4.0
So I knew that it had to be 50 times nine	And how I got the answers	4.0
And how I got the answers	I did my zeros tricks	4.0
I did my zeros tricks	I took my zero	4.0
I took my zero	I put it there and then they multiply five times nine which I knew was 45	4.0
I put it there and then they multiply five times nine which I knew was 45	Miss you can also count by 5s	1.0
Do I know	the rectangle that you just drew	3.0
What are these sides equal to	90 and 50	3.0
90 and 50	90 and 50	1.0
The bottom the top or the sides	the bottom	3.0
Okay	And I think that	0.0
And I think that	Hold on hold on	0.0
Hold on hold on	So the bottom is equal to 90 because this side is 90	4.0
So the bottom is equal to 90 because this side is 90	So that means this side has to be 90	4.0
Or this side	I think its 50 Because on the other side its also 50	4.0
So what is this side equal to		3.0
So what is 90 times 0		3.0
		1.0
So what am i multiplying in my final rectangle	90 timesn50	3.0
90 timesn50	And they already figured out the answer because they its the same strategy they use for the 50 times nine	4.0
Okay Im going to ask someone then to use Sarah strategy that she showed us earlier with the zeros trick and walk me through how am I going to solve 50 times 90	Using the zeros trick	3.0
Yep	I know	0.0
Okay tell me	So um there are two zeros in the equation	4.0
So um there are two zeros in the equation	And so I put 2 two zeros at the end	4.0
And so I put 2 two zeros at the end	And then I count by fives nine times and I got 45	4.0
zero plus zero is	You will get 9000	3.0
You will get 9000	No youll get 4900 4950	3.0
All right	I use color	0.0
All right youre going to title your notes today Just division	Nice I can write it big	0.0
Alright Melanie tell us what division is	Division is basically backwards multiplication	3.0
What else do we know about division Arethra	Its kind of like similar to subtraction	3.0
Its kind of like similar to subtraction	Because like when you divide something you get small numbers and what you started with but its also kinda related to multiplication	4.0
Jose T what do you know about division	is the opposite of it  Its the opposite of multiplication to and the same as a subtraction	3.0
Brady what do you know about division	I know that its	0.0
I know that its	So you take one number say like 12 Then you divide it by two And thats going to be I think two	4.0
You guys see this Okay	Yes	0.0
okay sweet	T	0.0
Yes Arethra	Why dont they have the same name for example factors in the multiplication problem	2.0
Why dont they have the same name for example factors in the multiplication problem	They both have the same name but in Division both numbers have a different name	2.0
Does anyone think they know the answer to Arethras question	I think	0.0
okay Mabel what do you think	I think its different Because they should have the same name because some are very different equations to what youre learning	4.0
So our dividend shows us how many we started with so 12 12345101112 and were breaking it up into how many groups	two	3.0
And how many are in each group	Six	3.0
If instead of making them into two groups I divide them all up into groups of two	I dont think youre inauidble	3.0
I dont think youre inauidble	And youre not going to get the um Youre not going to get a different answer	1.0
Why not	I think that you are going to get a different answer	3.0
Okay lets see	Youre gonna get a different answer	3.0
Youre gonna get a different answer	Oh wait	0.0
Oh wait	youre going to get the same answer because I did the math	1.0
youre going to get the same answer because I did the math	And there were there were six groups of two	3.0
Do we agree that theres going to be six groups of two Braxton	I agree with Brady are there I dont how to explain	1.0
I agree with Brady are there I dont how to explain	I did the math I think it is six	1.0
Count them with me	123	0.0
We have how many Brady	Six	3.0
because all were doing or Im sorry Arethra	I think I know	0.0
Okay tell me	because its like when you I do two groups of six you get the answer 12 and two groups and six groups of two you also get the answer 12	4.0
Does anybody know what the answer to a division problem is	I think I know	0.0
What is the vocabulary word	I think the vocabulary word is division	3.0
I think the vocabulary word is division	I dont know	2.0
anybody think they know what the answer to a division problem is	I think I know	0.0
what is it	answer	3.0
What is the answer to an addition problem	Sum	3.0
What is the answer to a subtraction problem	Difference	3.0
difference What about a multiplication problem	Product	3.0
Youre telling me that people know all three of those that nobody knows what the answer to a division problem is	Sum	3.0
Sum	Yes	1.0
It is a quotient	Like a quotation mark	3.0
All right Eden can you tell us your your idea for a game	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	My game is that you pick a stick and whoevers name lands on it types to you in the chat for the question and then we try to solve it	0.0
Alright Bruce go	How I solved this problem is is is I I was thinking about multiplication and then I multiplied it Four times five	4.0
How I solved this problem is is is I I was thinking about multiplication and then I multiplied it Four times five	And then and then I got and then that equals 20  so and then there was a five in it so so I knew the answer was four	4.0
Did anyone do the same thing as Bruce	I did it a different way	1.0
I did it a different way	I did it the same but inauidble	1.0
I heard a couple	I did it the same way too	1.0
Braxton how did you do it	Um I so I put I put like in my mind of like 20 dots	4.0
Um I so I put I put like in my mind of like 20 dots	And then I put five groups and then theres four groups	4.0
And then I put five groups and then theres four groups	So I knew it was four	4.0
Braxton you got the same answer as Bruce right	Yeah yeah	1.0
Lionel it is okay to unmute and say I dont know	Can you ask the question again	0.0
Lionel looking at this problem right here we have five what is this number right here	655	3.0
So how many hundreds Am I going to draw		3.0
Jessie How do you know that	Because it um if you actually like count back like the five on the very end is the ones and the the one in the middle Is the 10s	4.0
Because it um if you actually like count back like the five on the very end is the ones and the the one in the middle Is the 10s	And when you go one more back its the hundreds	4.0
How many times Am I gonna have go ahead unmute and tell me	Five	3.0
So 12345 and how many ones Am I going to have	Five	3.0
Finely what do you what do you think	Im actually I need to leave to go to a dentist appointment	0.0
This is a Why do you think we start with our big instead of our little amount	I think we start with our big amounts we dont get confused and think that the small amount is our final answer	4.0
Robbie you have something else to say	I feel like we also start with the biggest place value so that were minus were subtracting like more and it can like waste less less time I guess	4.0
If theyre going to get an equal amount	Maybe you cant do that	3.0
So how many can each person get equally	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
So altogether how many hundreds did I take away	Five	3.0
Okay so Im taking away five off my table and how many hundreds do I have left on my table	One	3.0
Then youre gonna ask yourself again can I give each of my  five people 100	Yes	0.0
Yes	Wait what was the question again	0.0
Because if I take my 10 my 100 here and I break it up into 10 How many 10s Am I getting out of 100	10	3.0
So really what Im asking you guys is 15 divided by five what is that	Three	3.0
I can split my 15 up into groups of three and each person will get	an even amount	3.0
And how many times do I have left on my table		3.0
how many ones can each of my people get if I have f ones	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
And how much do I have left on my table	Zero	3.0
Zero	And the Answer is 131	3.0
If not I need to erase it	Im still writing it	0.0
Theres that glare is gone	these steps very really remind me of the steps for partial quotients	3.0
We like having steps because it helps us out a little bit	And also like the writing kind of looks similar	3.0
And also like the writing kind of looks similar	Like theres like the arrows that kind of cut do like the line kind of thing	3.0
What is step one class	Start with the 100s	3.0
Start with the 100s	Divide	1.0
Divide	Divide divide divide	1.0
step one is	divide	3.0
what is step one	Divide	3.0
What is 8 divided by four	two	3.0
class what is step two after I divide	multiply	3.0
multiply	multiply	1.0
multiply	Multiply	1.0
Now I want to multiply four times two what is four times two class		3.0
		1.0
Step three	Subtract	3.0
So then I say okay 8 minus 8 is	Zero	3.0
now Hey Colton can you mute please	Oh sorry	0.0
Okay I had an acronym for this before	Whats it acronym	2.0
Youre wrapping yourselves do monkeys Smell	of course	0.0
do stands for what	divide	3.0
Monkey stands for	multiply	3.0
multiply	multuply	1.0
Smell stands for	Subtract	3.0
Bad stands for	bring down	3.0
bring down	What about repeat	2.0
Can I put four into it	No	0.0
Colton what is your question	Um I I made up one for repeat	0.0
Um I I made up one for repeat	So do monkey smell bad	0.0
So do monkey smell bad	Really	0.0
I can only fit at one time	Yes	0.0
Then my step two says to multiply so four times one is	one	3.0
If I have for one timeHow many do I have	Four	3.0
four Im sorry five minus four is	one	3.0
No	No bacause that would be in the negative	4.0
What is 12 divided by four friends	12 divided by 4 is 3	3.0
12 divided by 4 is 3	3	1.0
Step two is multiply four times three is	what was the question again	0.0
That is step 2 four times three is		3.0
		1.0
12 minus 12 is	zero	3.0
And then Do I have anything else to bring down	No	0.0
No So I am 852 divided by four is		3.0
	are the numbers the monkeys	0.0
How did you How much did you and your partner both get	So I split one pizza in half	3.0
Which one doesnt matter	No	0.0
No	And then both had oh no	4.0
And then both had oh no	one half was given to one person and the other half was given to the other person	4.0
one half was given to one person and the other half was given to the other person	And then you get and then somebody gets one pizza then the other guy gets that pizza	4.0
Alright so how much did each person get in all Addy	One and a half	3.0
Im gonna redraw my circles	Okay so me and Angie we split the pizza	4.0
Okay so me and Angie we split the pizza	We split all 3 pizza in half	4.0
We split all 3 pizza in half	So that means that so far we all got at least three slice and then we split it into another half	4.0
So that means that so far we all got at least three slice and then we split it into another half	So we can at least get six slices	4.0
So you said you split them in half Yes	Yes	0.0
And then did you split them another time	Yes	0.0
Yes	And then we split them diagnal like this	4.0
And then we split them diagnal like this	We split them all like that	4.0
We split them all like that	And then we did the same thing over here	4.0
And then we did the same thing over here	So that while getting the exact same amount of slices	4.0
how many slices to do each get	We each got eight slices	3.0
And also how many pieces were in this one	pieces were eight	3.0
And you said youre saying that you each got eight	Yes	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
How did you guys split up this one	We each got four slices	3.0
Why	Its saying the same thing because we each got like one full pizza And we got a half	4.0
Yeah so they just got one whole pizza	we just split it up differently	2.0
Or is that leftover	leftover	0.0
okay Geof you have a different way that we can split up these pizzas	I have 12345678 in the middle	3.0
I have 12345678 in the middle	All were talking about the noise	0.0
All were talking about the noise	Oh so I feel like I have a solution for just drawing 7 lines in each one but I Coopert think thatd be possible	3.0
Okay inaudible	inauidble Straight and then that and that and then that but then make another line like in the middle	3.0
Why does each person get three pieces	Everybody gets three pieces Because there is two sides	4.0
Everybody gets three pieces Because there is two sides	Theres two sides	4.0
Theres two sides	So one side for the other person one set for the other	4.0
In this case what the denominator be	your denominator would be a two	3.0
And so then Im Lucci how many are they each getting in all	three	3.0
Im seeing a lot of heads nodding Im seeing a couple questioning eyes nodding	It just kicked me out the meeting so I had to rejoin	0.0
How could I split these pizzas up for six people	How many pizzas are there	2.0
See them on my board	yes now I do	0.0
yes now I do	Can you pre split them into fourths for me	3.0
Absolutely I can	T Can I go to the bathroom	0.0
Go quickly Cooper	All right	0.0
All right	Um Can you please color one piece from each pizza green	3.0
It is going to be person one	Yes	0.0
Alright and Asher I want to ask you a question right now	Ok	0.0
How many people do I have in all	six	3.0
Okay Asher is there enough pieces left for each of my other five people to get an equal amount is the first person	Im getting there	0.0
So what color do you want the person two	person two is red	3.0
Okay great	person four is purple	3.0
How about person 3	Person 3 is purple  sorry	3.0
Its okay	Person four is black	3.0
Person four is black	Person five is blue	3.0
Youre testing how many markers I have	and what other colors do you have	0.0
and what other colors do you have	inaudible	0.0
All right	Now Can you please split them into thirds	3.0
So if I split what I have left If I split these even like this am I going to be able to give equal parts to the rest of the people	No	0.0
inauidble person gets equal	I have the answer	0.0
inauidble  what was your idea	So to the way to make your pizzas  like cut into inaudible ways like cutting it 2 ways  its like  to do like that or like that	3.0
Oh how many pieces should I cut each pizza into	Oh a inauidble cut like that much and much	3.0
So are you saying 4 in each	So youre trying to get two so just like that	3.0
Is that gonna split evenly among my people	No	0.0
Okay so Pedro Tani Hager how many pieces would you splitWell what Idea do you have	eight	3.0
eight pieces Why	Because Okay	0.0
Because Okay	So like split split all of them into like like one half or something like that	3.0
One half	like draw a line a line between all of them	3.0
like draw a line a line between all of them	And then now the very last one	3.0
And then now the very last one	Do another line	3.0
Whats the number of peices	Six	3.0
So then how much of this pizza is each person getting	one piece of pizza each for each person	3.0
And what was the fraction for this one piece	16th	3.0
We started with our six again	Its the same exact answer for for this This answer is the answer to the first question	3.0
So what am I going to split my other 3 pizzas into in able to divide them equally	Six	3.0
How many pieces in all would each person get	four	3.0
Four what	four pieces of pizza	3.0
four pieces of pizza	six pieces of pizza	3.0
Zoey whats not clicking	I cant figure out like like so like you drew like five lines that made like six six pieces	2.0
I cant figure out like like so like you drew like five lines that made like six six pieces	But like Im not really sure how you made six six pieces of pizza	2.0
So the actual like the actual act of drawing it	Yes	0.0
Are all of those pieces equal	No	0.0
Now were all of these fairly equal	Yes	0.0
How many pieces did each person get	16th I mean 14 out of six  four and six	3.0
All right tell me the equivalent fractions rule Alicia	The equivalent fractions rule is that they have to be even parts	3.0
The equivalent fractions rule is that they have to be even parts	And also when its	0.0
And also when its	I wrote this down but I dont know how to explain it	2.0
I wrote this down but I dont know how to explain it	Theres a fraction and you were multiplying by something with that fraction and if you have the answer to the numerator you might find what is multiplied on the numerator	4.0
Theres a fraction and you were multiplying by something with that fraction and if you have the answer to the numerator you might find what is multiplied on the numerator	And then on the bottom you do the same thing	4.0
So Alicia can you give me an example of a fraction	Six times ten	3.0
Six times ten	I mean	0.0
Okay so six tenths	Six tenths	3.0
Six tenths	Yes thats what I meant	0.0
So Arcane give me a number that I can multiply six tenths by to get an equivalent fraction	Can it be any number	0.0
Any number but I would make it one through twelve just to make it easier	Okay	0.0
Okay	Nine	0.0
What would my new denominator be	The new denominator would be which one the top one or the bottom one	2.0
Oh so do we need to know the definition of denominator to be able to figure out what Im asking	I forgot it from the weekend	0.0
Is it the top number or bottom number Troy	I think the denominator is the bottom number	3.0
Darnell do you agree with Troy	Hmm	0.0
Theyre trying to give you a hint	Yeah	0.0
Okay so Darnell now knowing that the denominator is the bottom number what would the denominator of my new fraction be	It would be 90	3.0
What would my numerator be Kyle	Hello	0.0
Hello	I know	0.0
All right Arcane tell me what would the numerator would be		3.0
Bonnie	I think that 54 90ths are going to have the smaller pieces because its 54 out of 90 when the other ones only six out of 10	4.0
How many pieces do we have in all	Two	3.0
How big would the 90ths be	Thats 12	3.0
What is a factor Arcane	Did you call me	0.0
I did	Well I know the answer but I dont really know how to explain it but its You skip count	3.0
Arcane	But its because I forgot but I did those in ST	0.0
But its because I forgot but I did those in ST	Math	0.0
So do you remember now or do you need to phone a friend	Phone a friend	0.0
All right Arcane phone a friend	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	Bonnie	0.0
Bonnie	A factor is the two numbers that you put together to make a multiplication problem	3.0
A factor is the two numbers that you put together to make a multiplication problem	For example two and two equals four	3.0
For example two and two equals four	So two would be a factor	3.0
Carmen what can I multiply together to get two	Sorry one times two	3.0
If you know a factor of eight I want you to unmute and tell me	Two times four	3.0
Two times four	One and eight	1.0
One and eight	Two times four	3.0
Two times four	Three times eight	1.0
What factors do two and eight have in common Janessa	What do what	0.0
What two factors do two and eight have in common	Those two factors have in common its that you can multiply two numbers so it can be a bigger number	3.0
Do they have any numbers in common Janessa	Yes they do	3.0
Yes they do	They have the four and the eight	3.0
So wait do I see a four up here in this one	Oh wait	0.0
Oh wait	No	0.0
No	So what do I see in both lists	0.0
So what do I see in both lists	You can see that theres two numbers that are the same one and two and the bottom ones one and two	3.0
How many times can I fit two into two	One time	3.0
Im looking for a hand or Im going to call on somebodyactually yeah lets go to Kyle T Kyle T eight divided by two	Its four	3.0
Okay	I also have something that I see that is in the fractions that are	0.0
I also have something that I see that is in the fractions that are	I noticed something about them	0.0
I noticed something about them	Is that besides the one in the factors of eight theyre all counting by two	4.0
Very interesting absolutely	Four six eight	4.0
Four six eight	No six but eight is still something that you can get by counting by twos	4.0
Lets see lets go to Jackie	Yes	0.0
How am I going to use the knowledge of using a common factor of two to create an equivalent fraction for two sixths	Making the answer	0.0
Yep	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	So you cant divide two and two	3.0
I cant	I think	0.0
How many is in each group	One	3.0
How am I going to find out my denominator	Six divided by two is three	4.0
If you know factor of six I want you to yell it out for me	One and six	3.0
One and six	Two	3.0
Two	Three	1.0
Three	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	six	1.0
What can I multiply together to get 12	Six and two	3.0
Six and two	Two four six eight 10	3.0
Two four six eight 10	Two and four	1.0
Two and four	Two and six	1.0
Two and six	I already did that	0.0
I already did that	One	1.0
One	You have to count by four and it equals eight	3.0
Matteo whats a factor that you see on both lists	One two three and six	3.0
River which factor should I use	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	Phone a friend	0.0
River just look at the circled fractions pick one	Oh	0.0
Oh	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Two two	0.0
How many times can I count by twos to get six	Two	3.0
Two four	Six	3.0
So how many times did I count by two	Oh three	3.0
What about my denominator	Hmm	0.0
Hmm	Six I think	3.0
Six I think	Six	3.0
What other factor could I use Alicia	Three	3.0
Okay Alicia tell me how I would use three	So you would divide them by three and on the denominator for that is two on the I mean the numerator	3.0
Ah the numerator is two why is the numerator two	Because you can fit three two times into six	4.0
And what about the denominator	Four because if you count four three times it would be 12	4.0
What are we going to do with it Jacob	What	0.0
What do we do with them	Can I phone a friend	0.0
If you know what we do with this four I want you to raise your hand	Lionel	0.0
Gio what are we going to do with this four	What you guys do about the four so you know how eight times two equals 14 Well eight that would make 16	4.0
What you guys do about the four so you know how eight times two equals 14 Well eight that would make 16	And if you have two more Now Im confused	2.0
Karla what are we going to do with the four	Divide it	3.0
So eight divided by four Karla what is eight divided by four	Hmm	0.0
How many times can I count out four to get eight	Two times	3.0
And what about 12 divided by four	Three	3.0
Do this on your paper	T	0.0
Yes	Can I type in the chat once I find my answer	0.0
Sophia what are we going to do	Take away	3.0
Paulina	Were going to divide	3.0
Alicia	Five	3.0
You had your hand up a minute ago	Im sorry	0.0
Its okay	It will only fit one time	3.0
And what about my denominator	The denominator will be two	3.0
The denominator will be two	Two times will fit	3.0
Karla what equivalent fraction do I have right here	One	3.0
One	One out of two	3.0
All right	Wait for this work are we going to have to take a picture of our work or is this just	0.0
What was our benchmark fraction Manny	I was going to tell you I cant find the comparing fractions	0.0
Then youre going to at the top of a new page of notes youre going to put the title again	Okay	0.0
What is the fraction that we were using to compare fractions	I know	0.0
What is it	One on top of two	3.0
So now what I need to do is I need to create another number line that is the exact same size for three fifths but this time how many pieces am I going to put on my number line	Two and three	3.0
If Im three fifths	I think that you put five	3.0
Im sorry greater than or lesser than one half	Greater	3.0
How do you know that	Because if you really look at it closely the dots on the bottom where the fractions are if you connect to them together its not a straight line	4.0
Because if you really look at it closely the dots on the bottom where the fractions are if you connect to them together its not a straight line	Its like a diagonal line	4.0
So Ive created another number line for my three fourths but now on this number line how many pieces am I going to add	I think that you would have four and then you would mark your three at the point right next to the end	0.0
Well which one is bigger	I think its three fourths because it is in a bigger spot on the number line	4.0
So I said the bigger the denominator	The bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	3.0
So Im going to let them have that choice	Im done	0.0
I saw your hands help me out	I feel like the three fifths would be bigger because on ST math when I was doing my the ones the fracks or whatever its called the bigger it got the smaller the blocks were	4.0
I feel like the three fifths would be bigger because on ST math when I was doing my the ones the fracks or whatever its called the bigger it got the smaller the blocks were	So I think three is bigger because of that	4.0
Three fifths or four fifths	one of them says three fifths because when you get bigger numbers then the pieces are smaller	4.0
Aries what are you thinking	If you had a two circles and you wait actually let me think about this	0.0
I have two circles	I think I agree because on the first circle put in three three things or whatever	4.0
Well how many pieces do I have in all in this circle	One whole	3.0
The numerator or the denominator tells me	I cut the five pieces	3.0
Then how many of those am I going to fill in Aries	Three	3.0
1 2 3	Wait	0.0
Wait	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Im disagreeing now	1.0
Why	Because when because if you color it if you do the same thing in the other one and color four in theres more	4.0
Oh my goodness because they have the same what	Same what do you call it	2.0
Same what do you call it	They have the same denominator	1.0
So which one is bigger	Four fifths	3.0
Which one has smaller pieces Adeline	Four eighths	3.0
Adeline	The four fifths	3.0
Looking for hands Tracy What do you think	The two one thousandths	3.0
Why	Because 1000 is 10 times bigger than the 10	4.0
So how many pieces does that tell me is going to be in this shape	Like number	0.0
How man pieces in all	1234	3.0
Based on my denominator	Oh one thousand	3.0
Are these pieces really big or are they really small	Theyre super super super super super small	3.0
Aries what are you thinking	Its actually the two tenths because when you colored two in the thousands you barely even see it but in the two tenths when you make like 10 color two its going to be more bigger compared to the other one	4.0
So I have 10 here and Im going to fill in two of them	If you fill in two in 1000 its going to be tiny	3.0
Tracy if youre talking to us we cannot hear you	Oh sorry I went to the bathroom	0.0
Did you see what we just did	No	0.0
So lets see who can explain what we just did	So we drew a circle of 1000 lines	3.0
Yeah	We think its 1000 but so we put two in there and it was smaller	4.0
We think its 1000 but so we put two in there and it was smaller	But when we did it in the two tenths it was a lot more bigger than in the two thousands	4.0
But when we did it in the two tenths it was a lot more bigger than in the two thousands	I mean yeah	0.0
I mean yeah	And so we think its too tenths because its a lot more bigger than 2 thousandths I think	4.0
Aries	Oh what was I going to say	0.0
Oh what was I going to say	Do you know how it says two thousandths	0.0
Do you know how it says two thousandths	It kind of sounds like 2000 you know	0.0
It kind of sounds like 2000 you know	It kind of sounds like that	0.0
So lets do number one together who can read number one on my screen Meaghan read it out loud and proud	Using greater or less than compare each fraction	0.0
And what are the two fractions that we were comparing	Four sevenths four out of seven and then five out of seven	3.0
Four sevenths four out of seven and then five out of seven	And I think that four out of seven would be bigger because five out of seven would be a little bit smaller due to the its the same denominator and then the denominators are pretty big but the numerator is smaller	4.0
And I think that four out of seven would be bigger because five out of seven would be a little bit smaller due to the its the same denominator and then the denominators are pretty big but the numerator is smaller	As I think that the bigger one would be the the smaller numerator	4.0
Vivian tell me what you think	I think four sevenths is bigger because if you draw a picture you see that theres less pieces but there would be more to shade in	4.0
I think four sevenths is bigger because if you draw a picture you see that theres less pieces but there would be more to shade in	Wait wait wait wait wait	0.0
Wait wait wait wait wait	Im confusing	0.0
Im confusing	The denominator with the numerator	3.0
Just focus on four sevenths how am I going to draw it	Six lines	3.0
Six lines	And that will make sevenths	3.0
Or how many pieces did I have in all	Huh	0.0
How many pieces in all for five sevenths	Seven	3.0
And how many pieces am I coloring in	Five	3.0
Okay hold on a second which ones bigger	The one on the bottom	3.0
Sandy what did you say in the chat	I said ordering like on Amazon	3.0
Pedro is that a little bit better	Kind of	0.0
Like pin me to the screen	What	0.0
What	you could pin her	0.0
You can pin Me to the screen which makes me	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	0.0
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah	Okay	0.0
Victoria	Sorry that was leftover	0.0
If I say Put these four numbers in order from least to greatest	Wait	0.0
Wait	Say the question again	0.0
What does it mean if I say Put these numbers in order from least to greatest	To put the 12 first then 46 and then 120 and then 290	3.0
So what did Victoria do	Victoria basically put all the numbers from least to greatest and put	1.0
Victoria basically put all the numbers from least to greatest and put	the biggest number on the end	1.0
the biggest number on the end	And she did ordering	1.0
And she did ordering	And she ordered the fraction	1.0
And she ordered the fraction	As soon as Victoria talked about that I was like Wait	0.0
As soon as Victoria talked about that I was like Wait	Oh I remember	0.0
Tell me least to greatest	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	the number of least to greatest that its like a smaller number than the other	0.0
So then what does the greatest mean	After I answer this can I go to the bathroom	0.0
Sure	I forgot	0.0
I forgot	What was the question	0.0
What was the question	What was it	0.0
If least means smallest what does greatest mean	Greatest means biggest	3.0
All right	Now can I	0.0
Okay	Because least is smallest and greatest is biggest	4.0
Pedro do you have something to add or you have a question	Kind of	0.0
Kind of	But why does it say like ordering fractions when its like normal numbers	2.0
So say I gave you these fractions and I say Put that in order from least to greatest	Oh I know	0.0
How would you do this	so first the smallest one is oneeighth	3.0
How do you know that Pedro	Because like if I draw a circle and then cut it into eight and only one its going to be really small	4.0
Okay	And	0.0
And	And then the second leastest is threeeighths	3.0
And then the second leastest is threeeighths	Because like I said its like small	4.0
Because like I said its like small	And then the five the fiveeighth is next and then	3.0
And then the five the fiveeighth is next and then	Wait	0.0
Wait	Wait wait wait a little wait	0.0
Wait wait wait a little wait	Wait	0.0
Wait	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah	0.0
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah	And then the seveneighths	3.0
Well thought in his head consciously or subconsciously that Hey these all have eight as the denominator which means that every single one of these is cut up into the same amount of pieces	Miss I already know something	0.0
All right  what do you notice	You know how on top of oneeighth it shows oneeighth	3.0
You know how on top of oneeighth it shows oneeighth	And like thirdeighth is like right beside it and like seveneighth is right above it and fiftheighth is like pretty close to it	3.0
Ah	to the fiftheighth	3.0
to the fiftheighth	And its like going in a pattern because one two	4.0
And its like going in a pattern because one two	Its actually counting by I think Two three	4.0
Its actually counting by I think Two three	I think its counting by twos	4.0
I think its counting by twos	But I feel like its top numbers counting by twos here	4.0
John what is the smallest fraction out of all three of these	Onetwelfth	3.0
Why	Because a higher number is smaller than a lower number	4.0
Ooh what do you mean by that	Like you have a circle and then you have thirds in it	3.0
Like you have a circle and then you have thirds in it	You fill in onethird which which is bigger than than onetwelfth	3.0
Oh	And yeah same with the six onesixth	3.0
can you add onto what John was saying	So John is also trying to say that the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	4.0
Oh my goodness	So he would have chosen threeeighth three No onethird that would be a lot bigger because the pieces are bigger because the smaller the denominator the bigger the pieces	4.0
Oh	Onethird	3.0
Geo which ones bigger	Onethird	3.0
Why	Because you know how you say the numerators the smallest or something or like the smallest number	4.0
The bigger the denominator	The smaller the	3.0
The smaller the	But yeah	0.0
But yeah	So I feel like the onethird is the biggest because onesixth is pretty low because you know how you said on the other one its super low	4.0
So I feel like the onethird is the biggest because onesixth is pretty low because you know how you said on the other one its super low	I feel like thats why	4.0
Whats my last fraction	Onesixth	3.0
How would you order these from least to greatest	So first of all I would draw three circles	3.0
So first of all I would draw three circles	And then you make seven pieces on that one	3.0
Its kind of hard to do sevenths	And we you do 10 on the other one	3.0
Ooh Donna can I do rectangles	Yeah sure	0.0
Ooh	Miss is this like going to be like some Whats it called	2.0
Miss is this like going to be like some Whats it called	Like is there something on like  and math thats like similar to this where	2.0
Do you see how Im kind of struggling to draw pictures	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Miss are you good	0.0
They are evenish	Okay	0.0
Okay	And it would take a long time to draw a hundred squares but like if we divided the little rectangle and we made a hundred it wouldve been really small because they cant be big pieces	3.0
And it would take a long time to draw a hundred squares but like if we divided the little rectangle and we made a hundred it wouldve been really small because they cant be big pieces	So	0.0
So while I dont have a hundred here can we visualize how small the pieces are	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Kind of	1.0
Kind of	I feel like its more than a hundred but its okay	1.0
I feel like its more than a hundred but its okay	I think its more filled in than their squares	1.0
So tell me what were going to do with this information now	And so now we would compare which ones the biggest	3.0
And so now we would compare which ones the biggest	Now we shade three pieces on each one and see which is which one is the biggest	3.0
Now we shade three pieces on each one and see which is which one is the biggest	And so now we can compare which ones the biggest	3.0
So which one is the biggest Donna	Three out of seven	3.0
So Donna do I go three out of seven on this side	Mmhmm	0.0
So Diana if I have Or sorry not Diana Donna if I have three slots and Im ordering from least to greatest which one is my biggest going to go in one two or three	Three	3.0
So then which one is my smallest	Three out of a hundred	3.0
And what is my middle	Three out of 10	3.0
All right  what do you think we should do to look at this one and figure out which is the smallest	I think that we shouldnt draw because its going to take a while to draw	4.0
I think that we shouldnt draw because its going to take a while to draw	So maybe we should think about the rule the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	3.0
So maybe we should think about the rule the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	So I think that it would be	0.0
So I think that it would be	Least to greatest would be fivea hundredth fivetenths twoa hundredth and then twotenths	4.0
Least to greatest would be fivea hundredth fivetenths twoa hundredth and then twotenths	Thats what I think is how theyre going to be greater or less than	4.0
If I just have fivea hundredths and twoa hundredths could you tell me which one was smaller	No	0.0
No	No it didnt	1.0
No it didnt	But	0.0
Do they share the same denominator	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Pedro what you thinking	Wait where	2.0
Wait where	Its because I kind of want to do all of that at once	0.0
Tell me how you would do it	Well okay	0.0
Well okay	So the leastest is twohundredths	3.0
Why	Because if you draw a hundred I know youre not going to do that	4.0
Because if you draw a hundred I know youre not going to do that	But just picture in your head you have a hundred and like	4.0
But just picture in your head you have a hundred and like	Okay and to draw twos going be really small	4.0
Okay and to draw twos going be really small	And then if you do the fivehundredths it has the same denominator but five is greater than two	4.0
And then if you do the fivehundredths it has the same denominator but five is greater than two	So we know the next one is fivehundredths	4.0
All right Pedro continue on because you are on a roll buddy	And then the next one is twotenths because the same thing with the twotenths and fivetenths	4.0
And then the next one is twotenths because the same thing with the twotenths and fivetenths	Five is greater than two and then  And then fivetenths the last one so we know thats the greatest	4.0
Im going to	Multiply	3.0
So what am I multiplying 10 by to turn it into a hundred		3.0
And whatever I do to the lower one	You have to do it to the top	3.0
You have to do it to the top	You have to do to the top	1.0
You have to do to the top	You have to do it on the bathroom	0.0
So now what you do is you multiply five times 10 and that is		3.0
	Oh 50	1.0
Oh 50		1.0
How do you know that three over two is more than one whole	Did you call me	0.0
London if I were to draw a picture would that help me	Sure	0.0
How many pieces	Three	3.0
Three	I mean two	3.0
So if I have a pizza this fraction shows me that my pizza is cut into two pieces but how many pieces out of the two do I have colored it	Three	3.0
So London do I have enough in this one whole to color in three	No	0.0
So if I asked what is my whole in three halves how many pieces would make a whole if I have two in all	Hmm	0.0
Is this a whole piece colored in	Yeah	0.0
How many pieces are there	Two	3.0
Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number	Sorry did you call on me	0.0
I said Jose	Sorry it must have been my mom or something	0.0
Jose you here	Yes	0.0
Okay Jose can you give me an example of a mixed number	Oh I already forgot how	0.0
Oh I already forgot how	that last week	0.0
How are you	Wheres my notebook	0.0
While Jose gets his notebook to be successful in math Im going to call on someone else	Ms	0.0
Kumar give me an example of a mixed number	What did you say	0.0
Give me an example of a mixed number	I cant find it	0.0
Kumar do you have your notes from last week	Yes	0.0
Give me one of them	Wait just a second	0.0
Wait just a second	Okay	0.0
Okay	I cant find my notes	0.0
I cant find my notes	I dont know where they are	0.0
Guys we even talked about important it was to hold onto those notes and those definitions because we will be talking about them	Wait I think I remember	0.0
All right Jose	Do I just choose a random one	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Okay	Two fourths and the two in the side	3.0
So two and two fourths	Yes	0.0
What does it have Elliot	It has a whole A big two that represents the wholes	3.0
And it has what	It has the fraction that	3.0
It has the fraction that	The four represents the pieces	4.0
The four represents the pieces	So you know where that whole is coming from	4.0
A whole being W H O L E	Youll have two wholes	3.0
Two holes	And then	0.0
And then	Draw And then put Maybe go back to the notes that we had	0.0
Draw And then put Maybe go back to the notes that we had	Okay	0.0
Okay	The notes	0.0
The notes	So what we did was that we colored in both of those	3.0
So what we did was that we colored in both of those	And then at the other one we colored in two fourths	3.0
Emery	Four	3.0
Were so glad youre here	You didnt name it	0.0
What should we name it	Rob	0.0
Rob	Chili Bob	0.0
What do you play	I play french horn and	0.0
Yeah	I did choir last year	0.0
Awesome so you know how to count music too	I did trombone last year	0.0
Could you go	Yeah	0.0
Adriana did you play an instrument last year	I played the bass	0.0
Thanks sweetie	I didnt turn on background	0.0
Can you hear that in MathLand	No	0.0
Is that better	Yeah	0.0
It looks to me did you guys notice did we ever snap in class at the same time	I think we always did	0.0
Adriana what would happen	Theyre never going to be on the same	3.0
What do you think will happen	I think that theyll clap on every other third beat	3.0
Why you think we will or why you think we wont	I think we will because I think they wont because if they clap on different beats every single time theyll never hit the same one	4.0
Adelle what do you think	I think they wont	3.0
to collide every 24th beat is that a GCF or is that an LCM or is that a common multiple or a common factor	I think a common factor	3.0
I think a common factor	A common multiple actually	3.0
Adriana what are you thinking	I think	0.0
So did we ever have sound on the same beat	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
What do you notice about six and 12	Theyre even	3.0
What is the signal to you that you have an LCM problem or a problem involving LCM	Maybe if you have two numbers that both	3.0
Maybe if you have two numbers that both	When you multiply them by	3.0
What are you thinking Alicia	Maybe when youre listing	3.0
Are you listing factors or multiples	Multiples	3.0
Yeah	LCM problem is to	3.0
Is that better almost	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Adriana	I think	0.0
Do you think this is a GCF problem or an LCM problem	LCM	3.0
Adriana do you agree disagree or have a question for Brian	I agree	1.0
Why do you agree that this is an LCM problem	Because you want to find a common multiple of six and eight	4.0
Then I would say that would be an LCM problem	Then what would be a GCF problem	2.0
When we would divide things up into groups	What would it say the problem	2.0
Whats one thing we should keep track of in our table	Packs of cups	3.0
Alicia whats another thing you think we should keep track of in our table	The cups sold after the day	3.0
And then what else do you think	And plates	3.0
I moved 30 times	Let me try that again	0.0
Four would be how many	32	3.0
Five would be how many	40	3.0
So Alexa how many packages of cups does she need	Three	3.0
And how many packages of plates does she need	Four	3.0
Cole do you want to read it to us	Sure	0.0
Okay	And Collin	0.0
Connor do you think GCF or LCM	LCM	3.0
Corey do you think GCF or LCM	I think its LCM	3.0
Why you think this is LCM	I think its LCM because under it it says On the By one of the dots says least common multiple	4.0
No these are just for us to circle what we think it is	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Im not sure	2.0
Youre like all over these today	I think itll be LCM because the	3.0
Connor what would you like to add to what Alicia said	I couldnt really hear but I think its LCM because it says what is the first state the boys will have a game	4.0
I couldnt really hear but I think its LCM because it says what is the first state the boys will have a game	And thats basically saying we have to go to play to find  on the same day	4.0
Adelle do you want to read this one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	During a performance	0.0
Are you there Douglas	I am	0.0
I am	Yes	0.0
Can you give us the gist of this problem	Yeah	0.0
Im just remembering that	Theyre trying to split it two groups of students equally amongst themselves into and they have to have equal	3.0
Theyre trying to split it two groups of students equally amongst themselves into and they have to have equal	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Equal people in each group	3.0
GCF or LCM	I think GCF	3.0
Corey do you think GCF or LCM	I think LCM	3.0
Alan C do you think GCF or LCM	LCM	3.0
And Ashley what do you think GCF or LCM	Im not really sure but I think it might be LCM	3.0
Or why did you think it was GCF	I think its GCF because	3.0
Do you want to add anything for why you thought it was GCF	Sure	0.0
And why did you think this was LCM	I actually think its GCF now	3.0
Oh tell us why	Because its saying they can only be part of one group so out of all the students	4.0
Because its saying they can only be part of one group so out of all the students	So you have to find the greatest number so you can split them off equally	4.0
Well lets get started with our work for today	Ms	0.0
Ms	I have a question	0.0
Whats up	Did you see mine because I kind of did it later at night	0.0
You know what I will send you an email after I check it	Okay	0.0
Oh okay	For example if you had like a mixture of	3.0
I liked your  what was your for every example	For every three peas one green bean	4.0
in your Google Classroom	Yeah	0.0
My other classes will not run into that problem now	Yeah	0.0
As long as I can see your work on  you may	Got it	0.0
But I want you to tell me how would you think about sorting these different little shapes	I have a question	2.0
Yes whats your question	I dont really get how  so its telling me like look at all the colors and figure out how many groups	2.0
I dont really get how  so its telling me like look at all the colors and figure out how many groups	But then what do you do on that	2.0
So I would think about like how many different color groups do you see there	Four	3.0
How many different areas do you have	Whats an area	2.0
This one has an area of two	So I need to add all of them together	3.0
So I would see how many different areas you have	Okay	0.0
Dexter have many different color groups do you see	I see four	3.0
What colors do you see	Green red blue and yellow	3.0
Lindsey	How are you supposed to like find the groups of area	2.0
And then I see some shapes that have an area of three	Theres a green one and a red one	3.0
Dexter did you think of another category	No	0.0
Yeah Cooper	By their shapes	3.0
So that would kind of be sorting it by color right	Yeah	0.0
Lindsey can you talk about your different categories	Sure	0.0
Sure	So the first time I did was color	3.0
So the first time I did was color	And then I did type height and width	3.0
And then I did type height and width	And just	0.0
What do you guys think	Theres seven different types	3.0
Abrahm can you tell us why you think that the two and the four are switched in the first two ratio statements	The two and the four	0.0
Yeah	Because the two and the four is  understand why its a smaller number like in front	4.0
Because the two and the four is  understand why its a smaller number like in front	I dont get that part	2.0
Do you see in the first statement how purple come first	Yeah	0.0
Thats awesome	Its just kind of a collection of random point shoes	3.0
Charlie can you read your first one	The whole	0.0
The one that starts with the ratio of pencils	Oh	0.0
Oh	I have the ratio of pencils to colored pencils is 12 to nine	4.0
You have 12 pencils and nine colored pencils	Yeah	0.0
Elise can you read yours for us	Mine is the ratio of size five soccer balls to size four balls is three to two	4.0
Colette can you read yours for us	Yes	0.0
Yes	So I put the ratio of prepointe shoes to pointe shoes is one to three	4.0
You have three prepointe shoes	I have one pair of prepointe shoes and three pairs of pointe shoes	3.0
So you have two notebooks	Yes	0.0
Arthur will you read yours for us	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mine was the ratio of footballs to basketballs is five to 14	4.0
You have 14 basketballs	Yeah	0.0
Do you want to read these two Calvin	The ratio of pencils to pens is two to one	4.0
The ratio of pencils to pens is two to one	And the ratio of spare masks to headphones is one to two	4.0
For Abrahm I want you to try and use the word to or you can start your sentence with for every	Okay	0.0
Colette good job with your equivalent ratio with cats and mice	What were the words again	2.0
Yeah whats up	Do we simplify	3.0
Whats your strategy	So I wrote 6 times 4 equals 24	4.0
So I wrote 6 times 4 equals 24	So 24 divided by 4 would be 6	4.0
Do you have an answer you would like to share or do you have a question for me	I have an answer	0.0
Yeah go for it	I think its 6	3.0
Can you tell us a little bit about your strategies	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I think 14 is	0.0
I think 14 is	I dont really know how to explain it	2.0
What were you saying then	14 is equal to	0.0
What are we doing to 24	We multiply it	3.0
Yeah we multiply it by 14	Mmhmm	0.0
Would anyone else like to share their strategy for this last one	Can I share	0.0
Whoever said that from math land go for it	Um okay	0.0
Um okay	So what I do is I kind of think of 14 times 24 as 4 divided by 24	4.0
You mean 24 divided by 4	Yeah	0.0
Okay	So if its like multiplication with fractions I always think of it as division	3.0
Thats a great way to	I think of division as multiplication	3.0
So if we are finding one Go ahead Charlie	Oh	0.0
Oh	So I kind of think of it as whenever I look at fractions with multiplication	4.0
So I kind of think of it as whenever I look at fractions with multiplication	Instead of 14 times 24 I think of it as onefourth of 24	4.0
How does that help you	because onefourth of 24 would be 6	4.0
because onefourth of 24 would be 6	Thats basically saying 24 divided by 4	4.0
So you can think about	T	0.0
Everything you need is in Google Classroom okay	Mmhmm	0.0
Im glad youre here	Im sorry Im late	0.0
I didnt see her show up earlier today	She joined late	0.0
Did you have a chance to think about this one	Not really	0.0
Okay	I didnt really understand	2.0
What question	May I ask a question about that one	2.0
Go for it Greta	Okay	0.0
Okay	So Im kind of confused on how it would	2.0
So Im kind of confused on how it would	I thought it would be 4	2.0
Okay	But Im just kind of confused on what it would be	2.0
Would you like to tackle that answer that question Hunter	Sure	0.0
Go for it	Okay	0.0
Okay	So the only way I actually figured out how to do it was I figured out how half of 5 which is 25	4.0
So the only way I actually figured out how to do it was I figured out how half of 5 which is 25	Then I split that in half because I have to take the 4 apart	4.0
Then I split that in half because I have to take the 4 apart	I did Charlies strategy but kind of backwards	4.0
I did Charlies strategy but kind of backwards	I thought of divided by 4 as onefourth of 5	4.0
Were on the third one I think instead of the fourth one	Oh	0.0
Can I come back to you for the fourth one	Yeah	0.0
Go for it	Okay	0.0
Okay	So  thats 5 times 4	4.0
So  thats 5 times 4	4 parts of 5	4.0
4 parts of 5	So you have half of 5 which is 25	4.0
So you have half of 5 which is 25	Then you half that half of 5	4.0
Okay	Then I got 125 because 125 plus 125 equals 25	4.0
So you thought about dividing it in half and then dividing it in half again to get 4 pieces	Yeah	0.0
That fraction bar means 5 divided by 4	But isnt the 5	0.0
Emanual whats going to happen if you do that	Depends what color the blue is because if it was a really really dark blue Im pretty sure it would make it a lighter blue	4.0
Yeah	When were done is it supposed to be	0.0
Do you agree with that statement do you disagree with that statement or do you have a question about it	I agree with the statement	3.0
How do you know that thats true	I love school	0.0
Should 2 come first and 6 come second	Yeah	0.0
There are 3 tablespoons of blue paint for every cup of white paint	Disagree	3.0
Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Juliet	I agree	3.0
Tell us why you agree	because theres 1 cup of white paint and then theres	4.0
So if this says for every cup of white paint there are 2 tablespoons of blue paint do you feel like thats true	No	0.0
Louisa do you agree disagree or have a question about that one	I think that that one is false because Oh no	3.0
I think that that one is false because Oh no	Its true	3.0
How come	because if you look at it theres 6 tablespoons on the picture	4.0
Mmhmm	and then theres also 2 cups	3.0
So Im looking at the one that says For each tablespoon of blue paint there are 3 cups of white paint	Oh sorry	0.0
Oh sorry	I think that that ones false	3.0
Tell us why	because for 3 tablespoons of blue paint there is 1 cup	4.0
because for 3 tablespoons of blue paint there is 1 cup	So it cant be where theres 1 tablespoon and theres 3 cups	4.0
What do you think about that one	I dont have that one for my last one	0.0
You dont	No its all different order	0.0
No its all different order	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Its a mix	0.0
Is everyones in different orders	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Lets look at the one Thats kind of tricky	but mines in a different order too	0.0
What do you think about that one	Thats true	3.0
How do you know	because it has it lined up	4.0
because it has it lined up	I mean theres 6 tablespoons of blue paint and theres 2 cups of white paint	4.0
I mean theres 6 tablespoons of blue paint and theres 2 cups of white paint	It says it in the order of 6 tablespoons of blue paint	4.0
Yeah	It would be true because theres 2 tablespoons of white and 6 tablespoons of blue	4.0
Were looking for a diagram thats representing 5 of something to 2 of something	Could it be sentence one	3.0
Which one of these diagrams is representing 5 of something compared to 2 of something	Diagram D	3.0
Hunter which one do you think it is	Just for sentence one	0.0
Were looking for a diagram that is comparing 5 of something to 2 of something	Oh	0.0
Oh	I guess diagram C	3.0
Yes	Will some be missing of the card	0.0
Emanual check sentence four	Check sentence four	0.0
Check sentence four	Im on sentence	0.0
Im on sentence	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	I checked the sentence before	0.0
I checked the sentence before	I dont have	0.0
Sentence four or I guess sentence three Emanual	Yeah	0.0
Felix and Juliet you guys are on the right track	So what if theres some that dont have a match	2.0
Everything will have at least one match	Okay	0.0
Okay	Can you help me with them	2.0
Whats your question sweetie	So I got the first two or three of them but I when I go over to the next thing it says You got four cards out of	0.0
So lets check sentence number three	All right	0.0
So if you did	Oh	0.0
Oh	So Im guessing that it would be this one	3.0
Yup	All right	0.0
All right	But the rest of the cards I have them right	3.0
But the rest of the cards I have them right	Right	0.0
Everything is correct so far yeah	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
Hunter would you check the one that has sentence four and sentence eight	Got it	0.0
Check that one quickly	Just a question how is mine	2.0
I think that you had done them first	Im confused on that one because it doesnt look like theres any one with only 1 spaghetti sauce	2.0
Im confused on that one because it doesnt look like theres any one with only 1 spaghetti sauce	The only one that	0.0
Yeah	The only one that does	0.0
So a 1 to 3 ratio is also equivalent to a 2 to 6 ratio	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	T what do I do with the last two sentences	2.0
Hunter sentence four or sentence eight one of those does not match diagram A	Okay	0.0
Itll just be a different way of describing it	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
So I want you to figure out which one does not match	T	0.0
Yeah Greta	Could you look at mine	0.0
Yours is correct so far	All right	0.0
Mmhmm	Do we have to write them	0.0
You dont need to	What is mine	0.0
So youll need to figure out where sentence one goes	T	0.0
Yes Greta	Could you help me with sentence eight	2.0
Sentence eight is going to match with one of your diagrams that you already have	Okay	0.0
Okay	I know itll be like 2 and 6	3.0
Right	But I just cant really find 2 and 6	2.0
Can you scale it up to something else	2 and Should I do	0.0
2 and Should I do	Im not sure	2.0
What would happen if we triple it	Would it be	0.0
Would it be	I dont know	2.0
See what happens when you triple it if you do three times as many	Like 3 times 2 and 6	4.0
So instead of 1 cup youre going to do 1 2 3 when we multiply it by 3	So it could be 3 and 9	3.0
So you want to look for a picture that has 3 tablespoons of oil so 3 squares and 2 circles for 2 cups of tomato sauce	You would have to take half of 3	3.0
You want to switch it so you have it in the correct order	I dont	0.0
Id like you to go back and revise the other ones	Im confused on sentence four	2.0
Okay	Its kind of confusing because I dong get how they have 3 cups of tomato sauce for every tablespoon of oil	2.0
If we draw a picture what would our picture look like	It would be 3 cups of tomato sauce and 1 tablespoon of oil	3.0
So 3 circles right	Yeah	0.0
Then 1 square	But I dont have that	0.0
On your paper I want you to draw 3 circles and 1 square	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Got it	0.0
Whats going go happen	That would be a 6 and 2	3.0
Do you see 6 and 2 anywhere	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Yeah	0.0
Which diagram is it	Diagram A	3.0
Me too	Got it	0.0
Got it	Thank you	0.0
I love that youre asking me all these questions	I was wondering	0.0
How can I help you	It says that one is wrong but Im not sure	0.0
It says that one is wrong but Im not sure	I think its from sentence five	0.0
What shape are we using	We use tomato slices so obviously its a square	3.0
So tomato sauce is going to be purple	Okay	0.0
How are we representing oil	The squares	3.0
The squares	Would it be diagram D	3.0
So you can move it and it can match that group	T could you check my work	0.0
T could you check my work	Im pretty sure I did it	0.0
So one more ear	Oh yeah youre right	0.0
Oh yeah youre right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	He has	0.0
He has	Misses Konz	0.0
Yes sweetie	What are we supposed to do	2.0
What are we supposed to do	So are we supposed to basically	0.0
So are we supposed to basically	It says There are 3 cats in a room	0.0
So  I have 150 skittles divided by six students would you share your strategy for how you solved this please	I have not solved it yet I would just	0.0
I have not solved it yet I would just	Im trying to find the	0.0
Im trying to find the	I do know this	0.0
I do know this	I would take numbers like six times 10 like six times 15 would be one number and then six times 20 and thats over	4.0
I would take numbers like six times 10 like six times 15 would be one number and then six times 20 and thats over	I would like narrow it down in between those numbers	4.0
So you would figure out how many times six would go into a 150	Yeah	0.0
Yes	I was going to say my strategy	0.0
I was going to say my strategy	I just used long division because I have paper	3.0
Okay	And I remembered how to do it	0.0
Will you help with long division in just a little bit	Sure	0.0
Hugh could you share your strategy with us please	Its	0.0
We want to hear it	Just how I did it	0.0
Okay go for it	So six cant go into one so you have to go onto five but six can go into 15 twice and you get 12	4.0
So six cant go into one so you have to go onto five but six can go into 15 twice and you get 12	Then you subtract those and you get three	4.0
So were going to bring down our zero okay	And then six goes into 30 five times	4.0
what did you notice about 1 and six tenths and 4 tenths	They both have a decimal	3.0
Did you notice anything about factors or maybe multiples of those two	No	0.0
Did you notice something Charlie	I was just going to say that if you took away the decimal point it would just be 16 divided by 4	4.0
Greyson whats 16 divided by 4	Four	3.0
How do you know	Just because 16 divided by 4 is 4	4.0
What are you math facts you wrote down real fast	I just knew 4 4 times is	3.0
If you see 16 16 and a 4 well how can I manipulate that to make this problem a little bit easier to solve	Do you add a decimal point back there after you do that	3.0
Yeah	Its not reRamona working on my camera for some reason	0.0
Its not reRamona working on my camera for some reason	My computer is freaking out	0.0
Hey	So were probably going to go over this in the next problem but the same strategy we just used Im assuming that it doesnt work when one of the numbers does not have a decimal	3.0
Charlie since youre kind of on this what do you notice of the relationship between 90 and 45	Well if you can multiply 45 times 10 it equals 45 and 45 is half of 90	4.0
What do you think	Ten times	3.0
Nancy what are you thinking		3.0
So today our goal were going to talk about	Can I ask you a question about this	2.0
Whats the question	So is it always going to be times 10	0.0
Good observation	Thank you	0.0
The first person who finds it gets an air high five	Found it	0.0
What page Hank		0.0
Either this year or in elementary school	Does it have to be with ratios	0.0
Oh no it can be any math tool	We used a division ladder a couple weeks ago	3.0
What other tools have you guys used	Rulers	3.0
Charlie	Calculators	3.0
Calculators okay	Area models	3.0
I was hoping someone would say area models	What page again	0.0
Has anyone ever stayed in a yert before	We stayed in a yert before	0.0
Can you tell us more about what it is	Its like a glorified tent a very glorified tent	0.0
Edward what would you like to add	Its just a big hexagon and then on the ceiling there was a skylight at the top	3.0
Its just a big hexagon and then on the ceiling there was a skylight at the top	With one room theres like beds	0.0
I love it	Its like a tent that I drew	0.0
Thanks for sharing	Wait are we supposed to draw one	0.0
So this is reRamona important and this needs to be in your work	WOuldnt it be 12 people	3.0
Because 4 times 10 is 40 and 24 times 10 is 240	You were saying you dont write down 40 yerts	3.0
Hugh	I feel good about it I just kind of am confused on how you get the final answer the bottom one and the top one	2.0
Okay	Can I ask you a question	2.0
Of course	Im just confused on the top when you subtract from one and its 48 how do you get to 42	2.0
So I subtracted six from the top and one from the bottom	Do you always subtract always only one from the bottom	0.0
In this case one is in column one	Okay that makes sense	0.0
How are you feeling about that so far	Couldnt we just start by multiply six by 20	3.0
But if you can do that mentRamona totRamona do that	Thats what I was just thinking	0.0
And we have a ratio of one adult per five students	Would this be an adults	3.0
So 150  25 is 175 and then 30  5 is 35	Whats C2	2.0
You need 35 chaperones	What is column three	2.0
Column two is right here so I added the information in column two to the information in column three	It looks like	0.0
Did you guys get to go to  ch fifth grade and when I was planning Cowell Wood this was exactly what I would do to figure out how many places we would need	Well you just do half of	3.0
Penny what would you like to do first what could we do first to solve this	What I would want to do first to solve it isso we could get up to 130 players I think that we could do eight and one times 10	4.0
Hank	You could multiply one and eight times by six	4.0
So we could go back to the first column and why did you pick six	Because that would be 48 next and if you added that to 80 you would get 138 and you wanted to get as close to 130 as possible	4.0
Ophelia can you help me add these two columns together	Add column one and column three	0.0
Add column one and column three	So we use eighty	3.0
Ophelia what did you get for 80 plus 48	Would it be 128	3.0
Ismeal what do you think we should do	We could add another column	3.0
Were reRamona close right	Yeah	0.0
Lets just add column one right now	Yeah	0.0
So how many boxes will we have	The total well have 136	3.0
What do you think Penny	I think Ramona will need 17 boxes	3.0
Yeah how much will she have left over	Shell have six extra bars left over	3.0
Teresa what do you like to bake	I like to bake cupcakes or cake that kind of thing	0.0
What are your special skills	I like to make scones really good blueberry ones	0.0
I like to make scones really good blueberry ones	I also enjoy cooking with German recipes	0.0
I also enjoy cooking with German recipes	We like to make noodles and soup	0.0
I dont love to cook but I do love to bake	Whats the difference between baking and cooking	0.0
I would say like	Baking is more like treats and like brownies	0.0
Baking is more like treats and like brownies	Sweet treats kind of	0.0
Sweet treats kind of	And cooking is more like dinner	0.0
Theres probably a better definition	So cooking is like sweets	0.0
So cooking is like sweets	Cooking is more stuff on the stove and baking is the oven	0.0
Do you guys remember these manipulatives from elementary school	Ours were on magnets	0.0
Those are your sentence starters that you can use when you write your sentences	What are the yellow ones	2.0
Jericho whats up	So for the green triangles do we count them it looks like two triangles combined	3.0
So for the green triangles do we count them it looks like two triangles combined	Do we count them as one or two	2.0
When I look at that it looks to me like there are nine triangles	Okay	0.0
It looks like they make up other shapes but I would say nine	What are the red shapes	2.0
Lance can you start us off with one of your sentences	Yes	0.0
Yes	I said for every nine triangles there is six hexagons	4.0
Alexia do you agree disagree or have a question about Lances statement	I agree	1.0
Frankie can you share yours with us	I wrote for every six hexagons there are two trapezoids	4.0
Do you agree disagree or have a question about that one Lucian	I agree	1.0
Okay how do you know that that one is correct	Because I just counted out on my paper that they are correct	4.0
Lawrence really wanted to share what he has so far	For every three hexagons there is one trapezoid	4.0
I want you all to look at that and evaluate if you agree with that statement	I did the exact same thing Lawrence did	1.0
Jericho what do you think of that statement that Lawrence made and that Leland made	I think its true	1.0
So how is that a true thing	Do you want me to answer	0.0
Do you want to take that one on	Sure	0.0
Sure	So if you divide them both by two it equals three and one	4.0
So if you divide them both by two it equals three and one	So that would be three for every one	4.0
Yes Adeline	Can I ask a question about it	2.0
Absolutely	So can it also be for every six yellow hexagons there is two red trapezoids too	4.0
Because	Unless the top was	3.0
If I want to divide it in half my equivalent ratio would be three to one	Okay	0.0
Alani how many hexagons would we have in two copies of this flower	Two	3.0
If we doubled it how many would we have	12	3.0
If we doubled it we would have 12	I have a question	2.0
Yeah	Can you write on the board how many would be in two copies	2.0
Can you write on the board how many would be in two copies	Because I did for every six	3.0
When you have to double it again in order for it to be two flowers	Okay	0.0
Okay	So then 12	3.0
So then 12	So we would have four	3.0
If we doubled it Alexia what do you think		3.0
Or whats your favorite flavor of koolaid	Sour	0.0
I didnt even know that existed	I dyed my hair with koolaid	0.0
You dyed your hair with koolaid	Am I the only one whos never had koolaid before	0.0
Have you ever had any kind of crystal lite or any kind of powdered drink	Crystal lite Ive had before	0.0
How about Mathlans have you guys ever tried koolaid	I have but not much	0.0
Angelina would you prefer mixture A or mixture B and why	Mixture B	3.0
How come	Because if its super flavory it just doesnt taste as good	4.0
Do you think that B is going to be super flavored or do you think its going to be more watereddown	Oh wait I thought the small tablespoons were the water	3.0
Oh wait I thought the small tablespoons were the water	I would actually do A	3.0
Tell us what you just realized Angelina	I thought that the smaller blocks were water	3.0
But does that change which drink you would like to have then	Yeah	0.0
Which mixture would you like to have	Id like to have mixture B because the more flavor the better	4.0
Were going to assume its all the same flavor okay	Is each of those blocks a packet	3.0
Can you raise your hand if you would want mixture A	I would want water just period	0.0
And the rest are like watered down is totally fine	But think about it almost four blocks would be the same amount of water	3.0
Charlie what do you notice about these two mixtures	That theyre equal	3.0
How do you know that theyre equal	Because theres four teaspoons of koolaid and theres just one thing of water	4.0
While Marvin is typing Im curious Angelina what did you say for number one	I said they would taste exactly the same	3.0
What two numbers should we put in there	One cup and four teaspoons	3.0
Letter B	Can I try it	0.0
Yeah go for it Elliana	The mixture uses two cups of water and eight teaspoons of drink mix	3.0
The mixture uses two cups of water and eight teaspoons of drink mix	And then the ratio of cups of water to teaspoons of drink mix is two to eight	3.0
How would those two compare	Are the teaspoons koolaid and the cups are water	3.0
So you could have a bigger container if you needed	Technically it would be twice	3.0
Technically it would be twice	Equal in one more	3.0
But youre right look at this	Theyre similar because theres two cups of water times the koolaid mix which would be awfully similar	4.0
Yeah	The ratios are equivalent	3.0
The recipe is doubled	And if it just has an extra cup of water then its not	4.0
What would happen if it didnt have that extra cup of water	They would not be similar at all	3.0
They would not be similar at all	The mix would kind of take over	3.0
Huh	You just said it would be the best drink ever if it didnt have that water	0.0
You just said it would be the best drink ever if it didnt have that water	That would be yuck	0.0
I said I thought that maybe Isaac would like it	Oh I thought you said without the water it would be great	0.0
Five cups of flour and two teaspoons of vanilla	Vanilla is disgusting	0.0
Vanilla is disgusting	You didnt finish the teaspoon	0.0
You can just put it off to the side	A picture with cups of flour	3.0
A picture with cups of flour	What would the picture be of	2.0
Celine what are the two things that were comparing with the ratio table	Were comparing two teaspoons of vanilla to five cups of flour	3.0
What are you tying to do	Times two	3.0
Times two	Like double it	3.0
And why would you do that	Because thats what it says	4.0
Because thats what it says	Triple it	1.0
How can we get from five to 15	Times three	3.0
What are we comparing for this question	Flour and vanilla	3.0
Whats my ratio of flour to vanilla	Five to two	3.0
In order to solve this problem Jericho whats my next step	You have to multiply it	3.0
What should I multiply it by	Two	3.0
Now if it says five batches of cookies if I multiply it by two Im going to double it	Multiply by five	3.0
What do you think about multiplying it by five Jericho	That works	3.0
Alexia why do you agree with that	Because it would be five times that	4.0
Because it would be five times that	It would be 25	4.0
When I multiply two by five what would I get		3.0
But we love your singing	Oh sorry	0.0
And 10 teaspoons of vanilla	That was this weird air conditioning thing that we have	0.0
Yeah	Do we make a different one with flour to vanilla or do we make a whole new one	0.0
Ill give you a little time to work on question four	I dont understand	2.0
Angelina how can I help you sweetie	I havent understood how to do ratios since yesterday	2.0

They were a really small company	The guy on the screen and president hed buy 60 of them so basically they take a little companies and they make them bigger	0.0
Wonderful because youre all be so good at determining prices	Or Mrs	0.0
So this says to find the quotient mentally	Whats quotient again	2.0
Carter how can I help you	I already answered	0.0
I already answered	I was just	0.0
So Saffron what do you think the answer could be	I think the answer could be	0.0
Even if you give an estimate thats okay	I think the answer could be around 10	3.0
Charlie what do you think	20	3.0
Aysa what do you think	25	3.0
Ray what do you think	Does it have to be a rounding thing	3.0
Whatever you think	22	3.0
what are your thoughts	I think 10 is too low because 10 times 12 is 120	4.0
Okay	I think 25 is too high	3.0
How come	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I personally think its 20 and I think 25s	3.0
Do you want to keep that one there for now	No I think thats too high	3.0
No I think thats too high	Im blanking	2.0
Are you thinking maybe its in the ballpark close	Yeah	0.0
But a little too high	Yeah	0.0
Were you kind of using that distributive property thing when you were thinking about 20 times 12 and five times 12	Yeah kind of	0.0
what are you thinking	I think its 20	3.0
Sam	I mean if 25 is too high Im not really sure but I think it might be 23 too	4.0
Okay	Around that area	3.0
This is what Carter just did	12 times 10 equals 120	4.0
Okay keep going	If you add 120 again	3.0
So can we say another 12 times 10	Yeah so 12 times 10	4.0
Yeah so 12 times 10	So basically 12 times 20	4.0
So basically 12 times 20	That would equal 240	4.0
Okay	And then half of 12 is six	4.0
And then half of 12 is six	So mentally wouldnt it be 205 or 20 and a half	4.0
Tell me what it looks like	So it was 246	3.0
So it was 246	I divided by 12 so	3.0
You did long division	Yeah	0.0
Well we can check it with long division right	Mmhmm	0.0
Tell me what to do next	So then I know that 12 times 24 or 12 into 24 two times	4.0
Okay	So then you have six remaining and you can not do four times six so it would be times zero so 20 remainder six	4.0
what do you notice or wonder	The numbers on these are quite big and eye catching	0.0
The numbers on these are quite big and eye catching	They are the main center of it besides  the numbers are really upfront	0.0
Are they big numbers or are they small numbers	They are small numbers	3.0
They didnt want to have one thats super expensive right	Yeah	0.0
So you would like it better if the second number was as a multiple right	Mmhmm	0.0
That would make it much easier to compute	Yeah	0.0
What do you notice or wonder	It kind of looks they are fractions	3.0
What could we describe those as	Deals	3.0
I like it	Could it be division	3.0
Zane	You could also use them for	3.0
You could also use them for	For every two batches of strawberries you get 3	3.0
For every two batches of strawberries you get 3	Ratios	3.0
Ratios	Ratios	1.0
This is a ratio here	Thats two thirds	3.0
We would say for every two containers of strawberries you would pay 3	Yeah	0.0
That would be the most delicious strawberry you could ever have in the world	If you want 9 sodas it would cost 33	4.0
If you want 9 sodas it would cost 33	I did the sum quickly	0.0
If you look very closely its nine cases of soda	Oh nine cases	0.0
I think if I look carefully we would have a 12 pack	That one	0.0
Carter what are you thinking	So Im thinking basically the store is trying to make a profit by saying	4.0
So Im thinking basically the store is trying to make a profit by saying	So basically it probably winter right now for the strawberries and its summer for the potential buyers	4.0
So basically it probably winter right now for the strawberries and its summer for the potential buyers	Its a holiday with the soda and its winter with the strawberries because the store is trying to make a profit because the strawberries arent growing right now and they are just trying to get rid of them	4.0
Its a holiday with the soda and its winter with the strawberries because the store is trying to make a profit because the strawberries arent growing right now and they are just trying to get rid of them	So theyre not making extra by one for 3 and two for 6 and	4.0
They are giving you a deal	Yeah	0.0
Yeah Brian	Ms it wouldnt be on 9 sodas	4.0
Ms it wouldnt be on 9 sodas	It would be 72 because nine times eight each package has eight	4.0
It would be 72 because nine times eight each package has eight	You can see the eight on top	4.0
You can see the eight on top	Nine times eight is 72 for 33 because you buy in packages	4.0
Was it a 12 pack or an eight pack	Yeah	0.0
Thats some great thinking you should go grocery shopping for your family to find the best deals	Are these strawberries for free	0.0
Love them	No	0.0
Are you allergic	No I just dont like them	0.0
what do you think they are	I just dont have a	0.0
what do you think the two things are	Maybe money and avocados	3.0
what do you think	Eight avocados and 4	3.0
What can we do to get our number of avocados to 16	We can multiply eight two times	3.0
And well multiply it keep going sweetie	To get 16 and then four maybe times	3.0
Charlie whats your thoughts	So you know that four avocados is eight so that means and then four	4.0
Say your first part to me again	Four is the price for eight avocados	3.0
Okay keep going Charlie	And that is four	3.0
Thats awesome	Ms Davies Z has hurt his eye because he got an eyelash stuck in his eye	0.0
Well if he needs to go to the restroom to take care of that he is more than welcome to do that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Did anyone else have a different strategy to get to 20	I did	1.0
Yeah Aysa what did you do	First of all I did eight at the very beginning times two four times two that got me eight and 16	4.0
First of all I did eight at the very beginning times two four times two that got me eight and 16	Then I divided column one by two and that got me four and two and then I added eight and two and 16 and four separately which got me with all  20	4.0
Then I divided column one by two and that got me four and two and then I added eight and two and 16 and four separately which got me with all  20	And then eight plus two is obviously 10 and then I got the same answer	4.0
Annabel can you reiterate it	Okay so I think this what he meant to say	1.0
He did that very fast	Eight avocados cost 4	4.0
Eight avocados cost 4	And then 16 avocados cost 8	4.0
And then 16 avocados cost 8	Wrong way round	0.0
Wrong way round	I can explain it slowly	0.0
I can explain it slowly	And half of it is 2	3.0
Okay so pick up this and divide by two right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	16 plus four is 20 and then its half of the cost so its 2	4.0
16 plus four is 20 and then its half of the cost so its 2	10	4.0
So he said his next step was actually to go to get to eight and divide this by two	I think so	0.0
Okay and then Annabel and then what did he do next	And then added it onto the cost	1.0
And then I think he added together this column here and this column here to get to 20	Yeah	0.0
He just wrote back and he said Correct good job	You need a little bit more than 10 to buy them	3.0
Well how come you need a little more than 10	Because you have to pay the taxes	4.0
So next time you have a family member go to the store ask them to see their receipts because depending on how your food is prepared the tax works differently which is kind of a cool thing about food	Ms Davies	0.0
Yes	I have a different strategy	1.0
What was your strategy	Well I counted eight times three to give me 24 and that was too much avocados and I realized that it just count four and a half to get 20 avocados and that was 10	4.0
Im running out of colors	I think I might have	0.0
Crew nice work	I solved it	0.0
Two words and two numbers when you set up your ratio table	What are we	0.0
So flip your page over and youll see it on your desk	How many should we have	2.0
How many should we have	Didnt you say how many we should have	1.0
Didnt you say how many we should have	Two words	1.0
Can you tell me what two words were going to use in our ratio table	Large bottles	3.0
Yeah we can just do bottles if we want to	Okay and then the cost of the bottle	3.0
What information has been provided for us in the introduction to the problem	There are 12 water bottles	3.0
There are 12 water bottles	So theres 12 of them	3.0
Okay	And the water costs 9	3.0
Zizi how can we do this in one step	Well I just saw that nine and 12	3.0
Well I just saw that nine and 12	They both have multiples of three I think	3.0
We could say theyre both divisible	12 divided by three is four and nine divided by three is three	4.0
12 divided by three is four and nine divided by three is three	And 4 to three bottles	4.0
And 4 to three bottles	Yeah three bottles for 4	4.0
What do you think Zane	The last problem	3.0
And for every one word she said he said seven	For every one wipe theres two sprays	3.0
Tess what are your thoughts	Divide by three	3.0
What could we do	Divide by four	3.0
So how much is three fourths of a dollar	75 cents	3.0
How did you get that Riley	Well if you split a dollar in four 75 would be the third out of the four	4.0
So Im going to give you some time to think about that	Can we write on our paper	0.0
Zizi lets hear your thinking	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I took the four bottles that we already have because it cost 3	4.0
So I took the four bottles that we already have because it cost 3	I think I messed up	3.0
I think I messed up	Yeah I did	3.0
Yeah I did	Okay	0.0
Okay	But I still have to get three	4.0
But I still have to get three	Because theres four bottles and now I know I need three bottles to get seven bottles	4.0
Because theres four bottles and now I know I need three bottles to get seven bottles	My mistake was is that I added the four instead of the three	4.0
My mistake was is that I added the four instead of the three	But now I realize that I could just take 75 cents away from three and added them to get 525	4.0
I want to see you write something down please	What is the unit rate again	2.0
Hadley do you want to start us off with the dog or the cats	Dogs	3.0
What are the two things that the dog is comparing	Tricks and treats	3.0
What are we going to put for the cat	Okay	0.0
Okay	So the cats ratio is two tricks is 16 to four	4.0
So the cats ratio is two tricks is 16 to four	So every four tricks I mean every two or three series three	4.0
What should I put in this spot here for tricks	Wait what	0.0
What is our progress on	Its four	3.0
Its four	One trick she does she gets four	3.0
And then for our problem we can say 16 and then your right we can divide both of these by four	So for every one trick she	0.0
And now if these were a treat that you really liked Micah would you rather be the dog or be the cat	Probably the cat	3.0
How come	Because in the long run youd get more	4.0
Well even in the short term right	Yeah at least she doesnt need to do eight tricks as the same amount as the dog so its basically doubled	4.0
How come the dog gets more treats	Cause the dog does more tricks so more treats	4.0
So youre saying that overall since the dog is doing more tricks they get more treats	Yeah	0.0
So the dog has to work harder right	Yeah	0.0
Did anybody tackle the hamster problem	Sure	0.0
Okay	It should be 14 to four	3.0
14 every 14 tricks they would get four	That would be three and a half and one	3.0
Thank you Micah and Neil	I didnt really know where my note catcher is	0.0
So in the meantime you can take notes on a separate sheet of paper okay	Okay	0.0
Charlie turn your cameras on please	I dont have mine	0.0
Hey Micah when someone says unit rates what does that mean to you	Just 54 right	0.0
55	Okay	0.0
Okay	What was the question	2.0
What are unit rates	I dont really know	2.0
What were we trying to scale it down to	Oh we were trying to figure out what like its hard to describe	0.0
Oh we were trying to figure out what like its hard to describe	Were trying to	0.0
Were trying to	I dont really know how to explain it	2.0
What do you think of Paulina	Like you have two numbers and youre trying to find the comparison I would say	3.0
Frankie what do you think what unit rate is	Basically how much of something that theyre getting from one	3.0
Yeah Peter	I think its the hard version of a ratio	3.0
What is it cam	How many miles you can go on one gallon of gas	3.0
And do you want that number to be higher or do you want it to be lower	Higher	3.0
So like big trucks do they have a high or low MPG	Low	3.0
What do you think about those	Itll be high	3.0
Itll be high	Because	0.0
Im guessing her car is a little bit bigger not huge but it is a little bigger	Thats not terrible	0.0
Whatd you get	156	3.0
Hey can you tell us how you got 156	I mean I dont know	2.0
I mean I dont know	I just thought of what number plus what number will equal to 312	3.0
Yeah Quintin	Two divided by 156 I think its 78	4.0
You tell me how you got 78	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Well Half of 150	4.0
Well Half of 150	So like 75	4.0
Okay so you split 156 into 150 and six	Yeah then I got like 75	3.0
So two groups of 75	and then I got a three and added that on 75	3.0
Thats really good	Ill do one	0.0
Lets do it	26	3.0
Okay so we divide both of these by three	What I did was I took 312 right	4.0
What I did was I took 312 right	And I did a kind of a different way than you guys probably	4.0
And I did a kind of a different way than you guys probably	But I saw how many times with 6 going to 312	4.0
Were dividing by three here	Well Im doing math just a different way	0.0
Okay	So six goes into 350 times	3.0
Okay	And then six goes into 12 twice	4.0
And then six goes into 12 twice	So 50 thats 50 plus two 52 and half of that is 26	4.0
Not much better but a little bit right	Right	0.0
Okay	Im not sure can I have help	2.0
What question would you like to ask me	I just dont really understand	2.0
So how many miles per gallon did Sammys mom get	230	3.0
How much did she get for one gallon	23	3.0
Hey gentlemen listen please	26	3.0
26 so who can go more miles on a gallon of gas	Frankies	3.0
So from our first column to our second column Lilani what did we do from our first column to our second column	Oh divided	3.0
Yeah what did we divide it by	4	3.0
What did we do Leo to get from the second column to the third column	Divided by four	3.0
We divided by four again	One divided by four is 25 cents	4.0
Paulina what could we divide both of those by	We could divide it by four	3.0
Do you guys want to do four	Or six	3.0
So what is 12 divided by four	Three	3.0
Divided by four right	Divided by four	3.0
Yeah	I thought 12 divided by four is three	4.0
That to be a little bit easier	I think thats a little differently	0.0
Thats all right	I did 12 divided by three	3.0
So 12 divided by three is four and then	325 divided by three is 108	4.0
Can you tell us I got a dollar and 8 cents	I simply just divide it	3.0
What would that be	54 cents	3.0
So what should we do	Divide it again	3.0
Well should we divide it by	Two	3.0
Yeah Quintin	Could it be accomplished both the four and the two by just dividing it by six	3.0
You know what if you can do divided by six and you can do it mentally in your head yes	Thats what I did	0.0
But youre not doing a lot of work off to the side cause you want to make this efficient	Okay	0.0
Is it finding me	Can I say hi to this person	0.0
Can I say hi to this person	Hi	0.0
Do you guys know what a treadmill is	Yes	0.0
Whats a treadmill	Its like running	0.0
Its like running	You can put it on different inclines or different speeds and then you just run	0.0
You should be selling treadmills	I just have a go to the gym	0.0
what do you know	I use it sometimes	0.0
I use it sometimes	Some of them have peloton	0.0
And you can incline it so it can go from flat to it can go to more at an angle more steep	Do you run on it	0.0
With a raised hand can you tell me what you think that the 24 represents	The minutes	3.0
The minutes	It represents 24 minutes	3.0
what do you think that it represents	How much time they ran for	3.0
how much time did Winnie spend exercising	30 minutes	3.0
At least one thing that is the same and one thing that is different	What would you say that distance is	2.0
What would you say that distance is	30 miles 30 feet	2.0
Are youre asking what the 30 represents	Yeah	0.0
The 30 represents the amount of time they spent exercising	So their distance	3.0
You can look there and see if you can find their distance	Yeah I know but the both say 30	3.0
Yeah I know but the both say 30	So what does the distance stand for	2.0
So what does the distance stand for	Miles	3.0
Thats probably your unit	30 miles	3.0
Rodney can you tell us one thing that you noticed that is the same or one thing you noticed that is different	So a thing thats the same is the same distance	3.0
How far did they go	30	3.0
I feel like 30 miles isnt going to make sense because Sophie why do you think that 30 miles wouldnt make sense	Because you cant walk 30 miles	4.0
Because you cant walk 30 miles	In 24 minutes	1.0
In 24 minutes	in 24 minutes	1.0
Unless youre in a car	Unless youre Usain Bolt	0.0
They both went 30  what is something that you noticed that is the same or is different	They both burned a different amount of calories	3.0
Mai at 481 calories and Winnie at 411 calories	I feel like	0.0
Isnt that how you say it	If the I was in front of	0.0
anything else you noticed	They were both on the same level of 12	3.0
That must be an intensity level	I noticed another one	0.0
Yes	The incline	3.0
What about the incline	Theyre both 10	3.0
Yes	I noticed that the numbers by the two hearts theyre different	3.0
I noticed that the numbers by the two hearts theyre different	One of them is eight and one of them is 10	3.0
I wonder what that means	810 and that is P2	3.0
What are you thinking	Im thinking that the 24	3.0
Im thinking that the 24	Both of the times are different	3.0
What do you guys think about if we were to compare these two	I feel like 24 is getting a better exercise a faster one	3.0
I feel like 24 is getting a better exercise a faster one	I think 30 is because youre taking more time with your run	4.0
I think 30 is because youre taking more time with your run	But shes probably then speed walking when shes sprinting	1.0
But shes probably then speed walking when shes sprinting	Shes getting the better work out	1.0
Shes getting the better work out	She has more calories and its less	1.0
Dixie what do you think	I though that	0.0
Mai	No Winnie	3.0
Winnie	Shes definitely getting a better workout because she has longer time and less calories	4.0
Shes definitely getting a better workout because she has longer time and less calories	Thats not good	1.0
Thats not good	Less calories	1.0
Less calories	I think that Mai is getting a better workout because	1.0
I think that Mai is getting a better workout because	If you burn more calories youre getting a better workout	4.0
Raymond lets	Theyre going the same distance theyre on the same incline and theyre at the same level and theyre at the same distance but Mai ran it faster which means shes running or walking faster which means shes getting a better workout than Winnie whos jogging	4.0
So did somebody say how did you get that	Yes I did	0.0
So can you tell us one more time why you think that Mai got the better workout	I think Mai got the better workout because theyre both at an incline at 10 they both have a level of 10 and they have the same distance but the only thats different is their time	4.0
I think Mai got the better workout because theyre both at an incline at 10 they both have a level of 10 and they have the same distance but the only thats different is their time	So Mais time is 24 minutes which is less than Winnies time	4.0
So Mais time is 24 minutes which is less than Winnies time	Winnies time is 30 minutes	4.0
Winnies time is 30 minutes	So the slower you are the less you workout	4.0
So the slower you are the less you workout	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Basically the slower you are the less of a workout you get	4.0
Basically the slower you are the less of a workout you get	So Winnie might be jogging while Mai might sprint	1.0
So Winnie might be jogging while Mai might sprint	And also  Im saying May because that makes sense May has burned 481 and	1.0
Winnie	Something like that	0.0
Something like that	I dont know how to say that	0.0
I dont know how to say that	Bonnie	0.0
Lets be respectful of her name	She got 411 calories	3.0
She got 411 calories	So thats a decent amount less than Mai	3.0
Whod you see	Well it was actually my only concert that Ive been to	0.0
Well it was actually my only concert that Ive been to	A couple of years ago me my mom and my dad went to see	0.0
Nice	That was definitely a memorable concert because it started hailing halfway through	0.0
Dixie who did you see	I didnt see anybody but my mom went to an Ariana Grande concert	0.0
Raymond who did you see	I went to Red Rocks	0.0
Is there anybody who would like to share a concert that they went to recently	Ive never been to a concert	0.0
when you hear same rates what does that mean to you	That something is the same	3.0
And what would be the same	The rate	3.0
And whats a rate	The amount	3.0
What would you like to add to that	Maybe its the equivalent rate	3.0
What do you mean by equivalent	Its somewhat the same	3.0
Can you give me an example	I dont know	2.0
Do you have an example	Im not sure but maybe if you have different	3.0
Oh Ive called his brothers name	Mr does it too all the time	0.0
Who does	Mr Anderson	0.0
And so maybe Simon and Callie they both babysit and they charged 6 per hour	You did it again	0.0
And this is also in your packet if you flip the page	Sorry I was late	0.0
Sorry I was late	I woke up at five in the morning and I needed to drive to Vale	0.0
So if you flip over	Since when was three tickets 47	0.0
Since when was three tickets 47	Its 47	0.0
In a separate place on your paper were going to compare what Andre did	Theres no room to write	0.0
I need way more of your cameras on right now please	Wait wasnt it nine tickets for 140	3.0
Right here 141 and nine	I know but it says that you have 141 tickets and nine on your table	3.0
So it says Andre paid 141	No you have 140 tickets	3.0
Good catch	Darn thats a bargain	0.0
Yeah	So we got three tickets for 47 and then Diego also paid 47 for three tickets	4.0
So we got three tickets for 47 and then Diego also paid 47 for three tickets	So would that be the same rate because	4.0
Were going to look at some sparkling orange juice next	Whats sparkling orange juice	0.0
Selma you can go for it	makes sparkling orange juice by mixing three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water	0.0
makes sparkling orange juice by mixing three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water	makes sparkling orange juice by mixing four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water	0.0
makes sparkling orange juice by mixing four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water	How did these mixtures compare in taste	0.0
How did these mixtures compare in taste	Explain your reasoning	0.0
So draw me a diagram for Terrance please	since Terrance has one more liter of orange juice than Cassidy and one more liter of soda water more in quantity	3.0
It would be more quantity overall but I would say that the taste is going to be a little bit difference because this right here this is not a onetoone ratio so we cant just add one more of each and itll be the same	I feel like it actually would be the same taste	4.0
I feel like it actually would be the same taste	So the first one is three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water thats a one difference	4.0
So the first one is three liters of orange juice with four liters of soda water thats a one difference	And four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water thats another one difference	4.0
And four liters of orange juice with five liters of soda water thats another one difference	So I dont think it will be that far off	4.0
ow many circles should I draw for Terrance	Four	3.0
How much soda water	I did five	3.0
What are you thinking sweetie	I was just going to say five squares but I also feel like Terrances will have a stronger taste because its a one difference but I feel like it would probably be more of a	4.0
So you think Terrances is going to be stronger	Yeah kind of	0.0
Yeah kind of	I feel like Cassidys is going to be stronger because it has less orange juice than Terrance but also has less sparkling water	4.0
I feel like Cassidys is going to be stronger because it has less orange juice than Terrance but also has less sparkling water	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	I agree	1.0
I like your thinking for both of these	And also it depends what the sparkling water is	3.0
Can I show you guys a way to compare these	Sure	0.0
Yeah	We can do three divided by three	3.0
Caylin what do you think that information actually means in a ratio table so far	Maybe how much orange juice and soda do you have	3.0
Raymond what do you think we could add to Caylins explanation	I dont know	2.0
Can I help you out a little bit	Sure	0.0
So for every one liter of orange juice how much soda water do we have	One	3.0
Is that what you were going to say	Yeah	0.0
Yeah Dixie	Can we divide it again	3.0
What do we want to try and get to	Were trying to get to one	3.0
Which one do you think is easier	Probably the soda water	3.0
You think its easier to get from five to one and one third	No probably not	0.0
No probably not	Im not sure but odd number	3.0
So lets do that	So	0.0
So what is the one in the orange juice mean compared to the one and one fourth in the soda water	Well I guess it means that its not equivalent to them	3.0
So if I were to say this to you For every one liter of orange juice there is how much soda water	One and one fourth	3.0
Oh my gosh	No its Cassidy	3.0
No its Cassidy	I think its Cassidy	3.0
Are you switching your votes	I dont know	2.0
Now were eight of you	Can I explain why	0.0
Can I explain why	No	0.0
Thank you	Im kind of on the edge of both because when I look at the soda lot theres less on Cassidy so I think it could be Terrance but also the answer is greater on Terrance	4.0
Im kind of on the edge of both because when I look at the soda lot theres less on Cassidy so I think it could be Terrance but also the answer is greater on Terrance	Im late	0.0
Im late	So Im	0.0
So youre kind of torn between both of them	Yeah	0.0
Dixie what do you think	I feel its Terrance because he has more soda water and they both have the same orange juice amount but Terrances has a one difference	4.0
I feel its Terrance because he has more soda water and they both have the same orange juice amount but Terrances has a one difference	But if he had more soda water then how would he have more orange juice	2.0
How many minutes would you guys like to examine these equations	Do we need to write it down	0.0
That would probably be helpful	Okay	0.0
Set a timer for three minutes	Okay three minutes and counting	0.0
Okay three minutes and counting	Should we  them	0.0
You can do whatever you would like to do to solve them its totally up to you	Are we solving them right now	0.0
Emmie	Oh Sorry	0.0
Or do you have a question about one of these that you would like to answer	So I think that number one is true	3.0
Okay	And I think that number two is false	3.0
Number one or number two	Number two	3.0
So you think number two is false	Yes	0.0
Can you tell us why you think its false	I think its false because a tenth times 20 would be 20 fifths	4.0
Okay	And therefore its 10 is 24 would be 24 fourths which would theyre not be equal	4.0
Can you help me	Actually its 20 fifths is equal to four wholes	4.0
Okay	And 24 fourths is equal to six wholes	4.0
And when we simplify those theyre no longer equal	Yeah	0.0
Or ask a question	I didnt understand this or get it or I just put randomly but I feel the first one might be true	3.0
Can you tell us why you think the first one might be true	Well I trying to just guess and pick randomly	0.0
Well I trying to just guess and pick randomly	At first I picked false though	3.0
Sorry did you say true or false for number one	True	3.0
So I can help you with this one	How would you go about solving that or finding out if its true or false	2.0
Does that make sense how I got that part	So itd be just divided by	3.0
Thered be five groups of nine	Oh okay	0.0
What would that be equal to	45 fifths	3.0
Its 45 fifths but we can simplify it into a whole number	So you would just divide	3.0
What times five is 45	So nine	3.0
So now both sides of your equation equal nine right	Yeah	0.0
What followup questions do you have Giana	I dont have any thank you though	0.0
What would you like to tackle	I would like to identify the one that is true	3.0
Okay which ones true do you think	The third one that one	3.0
Okay tell us why you think this one is true	Because the numbers are just switching around and in regular multiplication	4.0
Because the numbers are just switching around and in regular multiplication	For example if you multiply seven times six and you said 42 and six times seven would be 42 so I think they have both same	4.0
So its true because of the commutative property	Can I have the last one	0.0
All right Im all ready girl	Yeah so I think its true	3.0
Okay	Because 486 is just equal to 486 over 12	4.0
Because 486 is just equal to 486 over 12	And then when you add 480 plus six its 486	4.0
Oftentimes keep going	these tiny cans and then they  bigger cans	0.0
Travis where do you think four came from	I think you just add it on the blue paint to the yellow paint	3.0
Theyre very small quantities by the way	What are they painting	0.0
What would you be painting with milliliters do you think	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Maybe a  pot	0.0
A pot	Pottery or something	0.0
Something very small	Maybe  painting for a small picture frame like final canvas	0.0
Do I see anything in the room that has maroon	Well maybe on that bag theres a maroon	0.0
And this is your recipe for maroon paints right	Should we write the picture down	0.0
You guys can just tell me	Two	3.0
What could we multiply in our ratio table	Times two	3.0
Hunter can you tell us one way that we could get to 15 milliliters of red paint	Would you add right	3.0
Well Im going to say we cant add five but we can add column one for sure	Oh okay	0.0
Travis how else do you think we can do this	Well we could multiply the first column by three	3.0
Do we have a way that we can easily get from eight to 80	Yeah	0.0
What would we multiply by	10	3.0
So looking at this Charlie what is one of our parts	The kids wearing sneakers	3.0
What was the ratio	Five to six	3.0
Five to six	So I guess five	3.0
What is our other part Hunter	Boots	3.0
Wayne what is one of our parts in this problem today	One of the parts	0.0
What is one of the things were comparing	So were comparing three parts of oil with two parts of soy sauce	3.0
So oil is one of our parts	And then were also doing one part probably of orange juice and 42 cups of marinade	3.0
So with oil soy sauce OJ	And marinade	3.0
So this is our part part part whole	Yeah	0.0
Hunter what could we multiply to get our marinade up to 42	We could multiply it by seven	3.0
All right see you later	I wish  more time	0.0
Am I right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I just save mine though	0.0
I just save mine though	I dont get allowance	0.0
A sticker costs 75 cents	It says 25	0.0
How many dollars is that	Its none	3.0
Its none	Its one dollar	1.0
Adelle what are your thoughts about that first question	Adelle	0.0
Oh yes Adelle	I think it would be 25 of a dollar	3.0
Tell us more	Because a dollar is 100 cents and this sticker 25 cents	4.0
Because a dollar is 100 cents and this sticker 25 cents	So I think that would be either 25 of a dollar or it could if youre talking about it in a different way it could 14 of a dollar	4.0
River what would you like to add	Yeah like Adelleaid you could do well you could do 14 you could 25 which would be 25 cents	4.0
Yeah like Adelleaid you could do well you could do 14 you could 25 which would be 25 cents	And since 4 x 25 and a quarter is 25 cents that would equal one dollar	4.0
Yes Frankie	You can get 25 you can get hundred divided by four	4.0
Why did you pick four	Because 25 cents goes into a dollar four times	4.0
do you want to talk a little bit about that	Yeah because 100 divided by 25 is four and if 14 of a dollar because you need four of them for it to be a whole	4.0
Yeah because 100 divided by 25 is four and if 14 of a dollar because you need four of them for it to be a whole	So if you have four of them you	4.0
Did you have anything else you wanted to add	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Do you say it like 25 or 425	2.0
Mathematically we would actually say 25 hundredths	Oh	0.0
But we might say 25 today just to distinguish between fractions and decimals	What about 25	2.0
In our class were going to work hard on using place value language	Okay because Ive heard different people say it	0.0
Yes and people will understand what you mean	Yeah	0.0
Yes Alexa	Well I just want to say that I know its a quarter of a dollar because 25  25 is 50 and thats half a dollar	4.0
Well I just want to say that I know its a quarter of a dollar because 25  25 is 50 and thats half a dollar	So if we add another two 25s then thats a dollar	4.0
Carson you were actually my next person	It cost six quarters	3.0
Six quarters	Yeah	0.0
Wayne what do you think	Well it depends on what cents are counted by but you could do 150 pennies	3.0
Adelle B what are you thinking	15 dimes	3.0
Clay how many cents are in one dollar	100	3.0
Archer where have you heard cent before	A percent	3.0
Absolutely	Hello century is 100	3.0
100 what Augustus	Century like cent	3.0
Century like cent	Because I was also watching on the Monday video of Khan Academy that they were talking about cent means century	0.0
River	Well theres	0.0
Well theres	Wait I kind of forgot what I was going to say	0.0
Yeah Annabelle	I dont know if this is really related to math but centennial	3.0
Yeah	What would that mean	2.0
River	I was going to say pretty much the cent for percentage	3.0
How many legs does a centipede supposedly have	100	3.0
Does anyone think that they know all of the people on these coins	I know one person	0.0
Blaze do you think you can name them all	Ill try	0.0
Go for it	The first one is Abraham Lincoln	0.0
Yep Abraham Lincoln is on the penny	I dont know any of these people	0.0
Does anyone know the nickel	Would that be George Washington	0.0
Mmmmm	John Kennedy	0.0
John Kennedy	Thomas Jefferson	0.0
Thomas Jefferson	Oh I was correct	0.0
Keep going Blaze	Thats John F Kennedy	0.0
So on the dime is Franklin Roosevelt	And whos that	0.0
And whos that	The next ones George Washington	0.0
How about on the half dollar	It looks like John F Kennedy	0.0
And then	I have a joke	0.0
Okay tell your joke	Right now	0.0
Yes you may tell your joke right now	Why is Abraham Lincoln what is it	0.0
Why is Abraham Lincoln what is it	The number one president	0.0
The number one president	Why is Abraham Lincoln our first president	0.0
Why waSt he our first president	No why is he our first president	0.0
No why is he our first president	Its a joke	0.0
I dont know	Because	0.0
Because	No why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	0.0
No why is Abraham Lincoln on the penny	Sorry	0.0
I dont know why	Because hes our number one president	0.0
Do you guys know	ISt there a lot of different ones	0.0
On this particular one is Sacagawea and she helped guide people through the Louisiana Purchase	I can name all the things on the back	0.0
So Brett how much is a penny worth	One cent	3.0
And then Brett what percentage of a dollar is a penny	One	3.0
How would we write that as a decimal	05	3.0
And what percentage would that be	Its five percent of a dollar	3.0
How can we do that with decimals	10	3.0
What percent would it be	10	3.0
Yeah	Ten dimes that equals 100 and 100 ten cents is one dollar	4.0
Ten dimes that equals 100 and 100 ten cents is one dollar	And so if you earn 10 of ten	4.0
And so if you earn 10 of ten	Ten is equal to 10 of a hundred	4.0
Avery how would we write a quarter as a decimal	25	3.0
And then what percentage of a dollar is it	25	3.0
Frankie you are up	50	3.0
50 and how would we write it as a decimal	5	3.0
Archer you have our last one you have a dollar	Wouldnt that just be 1	3.0
Yeah what percent of a dollar is it	100	3.0
Whatd you say	100	3.0
Im going to switch over what Im presenting so give me just a minute	says 19	0.0
19 is the page youre going to take a picture of	What page do we go to though	0.0
Brian and Clay and Alison I would like to see your note catcher and Aiden and Bethany please	Can I have a piece of paper	0.0
I know that this is already written for you but Im going to use the worlds fastest drying whiteout	Roblox	0.0
Roblox	Im on mute	0.0
Yeah Blaze	How did you get 10 going into 10 right after you did it going into 1	2.0
I know that this is written for you but I think you guys might appreciate it if I go over it with you too	Whats whiteout	0.0
What	Whats whiteout	0.0
Its just me coloring with a white pen	ISt it like a product	0.0
Yeah its like white paint	Oh what do you do with it	0.0
You can cover mistakes	Because if you use pen if you	0.0
Because if you use pen if you	It usually comes in a stick or you highlight and then	0.0
It usually comes in a stick or you highlight and then	But can you write on it after that	0.0
But can you write on it after that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Its not really about the money what if there was a remainder	2.0
So	Where did you get it from	2.0
Where did I get what from	Where did you get the 5 from	2.0
So Im just trying find the decimal equivalent for 25	Oh so you just picked a number	3.0
Yeah	that you thought would be closest	3.0
So 410 and 25 are equivalent and if I have 410 I can put a 4 in the tenths place and those two will be equivalent	Could you just do it mentally too	0.0
I just want to show you why it works	Okay	0.0
I want to see you guys writing that down in your note catcher please	Wait can you give us	0.0
Wait can you give us	Im not  Can you give us the definition of parts	2.0
So if you have a whole and you split it up into different sections	Oh I see	0.0
Oh I see	Its kind of like a part of it	3.0
Mmhmm	Okay	0.0
Three will go into 10 three times	But wouldnt it be 11 there because	3.0
Because I brought down my zero	No for the last one because if you have the 10 and 9 you still have to bring the 1  Oh wait never mind	4.0
No for the last one because if you have the 10 and 9 you still have to bring the 1  Oh wait never mind	Sorry	0.0
So  What Alexa	You got 10 the first time wouldnt you the 100 and then the 1000 the next time	4.0
Because I could get it to go into 10	Oh okay	0.0
We know that the 3 is just going to keep happening so were finished	Oh wait is the 3 going to happen because its 13 and thats a repeating	4.0
Correct yes	Okay	0.0
All right	So if its 13 repeating	3.0
Archer what are your thoughts	What you could do is on a ratio table since you can do either the up and down but still being the exact same numerator and denominator  Well not exact same but almost the same thing	4.0
Yeah you can go up or down yeah	You can multiply it by 5 or by whatever you need to to get the denominator to 100 to see what the numerators number is and that will be	4.0
Campbell what would you like to add	You could have just said to make it easier and mental you could have just said how many times does 2 go into 10 and that would be the 2x510 then you add another zero which would between 100 and then 3 goes in 15 times 5x3 is 15	4.0
Yeah absolutely	We could have just set those by 20 100	3.0
Yeah	Wouldnt it be important to add that zero in there	3.0
Wouldnt it be important to add that zero in there	Or does it really not matter	0.0
You mean in the ones place	Yeah	0.0
Lets go into the thousandths place	Its just going to start repeating again	3.0
It is going to start repeating again because 6 will go into 40 six times	Just to make sure you probably want to do it a few more times but theres not a lot of	3.0
So your repeating sign should only go above the 6	Why	2.0
Yeah	I forgot	0.0
All right Brett what is one that you would like to fill in	I can do the first one	0.0
I can do the first one	I think that the first box would be  Well I waSt sure if it was 3 or 5	3.0
Catalina what are you thinking	I think its 5 because 5 is half of 10	4.0
Yes Alison	I think that is 15	3.0
Annabelle what were some other ones you knew	The third one	3.0
Are those fourths	Yes	0.0
Okay go for it	The first one I think its 25	3.0
Tell us how you figured that out	Because its 14 of 100 or 1	4.0
Because its 14 of 100 or 1	And then the next one is 75	4.0
River do you want to tell us one you figured out	I think the very last one would be 1 first	3.0
Yeah 110 you got it or 1	Yeah and the next one would be 3 or 03	3.0
Yeah and the next one would be 3 or 03	The next one would be 7	3.0
Yeah	And the next one 09	3.0
Carson	I know the 15	3.0
Yeah whats 15	Its 2	3.0
We didnt talk about that one together	Because I just did 10 2  because 5 is just 2 times or 5x2 is 10	4.0
So Carson if every time we add 15 we add 2 what would 25 be	4 6 and then 8	4.0
Yeah Alison	I think I have one figured out	0.0
Which one you like to add	I knew the fifth one	0.0
Which fraction is that	The 16	3.0
Sure whats 16 going to be	Sorry the sixth	3.0
Sorry the sixth	That one	3.0
What is 16 going to be	It would be 16	3.0
So thats just a trick to help you remember it	Are all 6s like that	3.0
Alison what else did you have to add sweetie	The next one will be 83	3.0
Yeah how did you get that one	Because I used the 10 and then add 6	4.0
Frankie what would 13 be	Well I wrote it as 34 but then the 6 goes on so I dont know how to write that	2.0
So Frankie can I ask you a followup question	Yes	0.0
If we know that 13 is 3 repeating what do you think 23 is going to be	6	3.0
Add one more thing to a 6	Repeating	3.0
Yeah River	I was going ask if I could do the last one	0.0
Are we looking at eights	Yeah	0.0
Lets do it	Okay so I think the 18 would be I think it would be 01 for that one	3.0
And then Catalina	For the 28 even though that doeSt have box you can still figure out that that would be 250	3.0
So what would 38 be then	I dont know	2.0
Catalina what do you think	365	3.0
Can you tell us how you got that	125 plus 125 is 250 plus another 125 is 750	4.0
Which one you like to do 58 or 78	58	3.0
Okay whats 58 going to be	I think its 695	3.0
What do you think Alexa	550	3.0
Annabelle what are your thoughts	I forget its either 565 or 665	3.0
Carson do you want to do the last one for us	Sure	0.0
Sure	I got 873	3.0
Yeah	I think theres a pattern	3.0
Whats the pattern Augustus	Nevermind I dont think there is	3.0
You just did some major inspiration here	I see 125 then I see 75 then I see 25 then I see 75 and then the numbers also change by 200	4.0
I see 125 then I see 75 then I see 25 then I see 75 and then the numbers also change by 200	I think you add 200 each time	4.0
Its just keeps increasing by 125	Wait what would be	0.0
Yeah Carson	Do we still have to take a picture of this	0.0
Ainsley what are your thoughts	Where we see aquatic animals	0.0
Ooh aquatic animals	aquarium	0.0
Aqua meaning what	Water	0.0
Did you know that	Why	0.0
You can go and do a behind the scenes meet and greet with their sloth which you would not normally typically find in an aquarium	They also have polar bears right	0.0
Or is this a part to part to whole problem	Would it be part to part to whole	3.0
Why are you thinking its part to part to whole	Maybe because theres numbers that are adding up to one	4.0
What do you think our parts could be Danielle	Kids and chaperones	3.0
Colten what should we put in that box for the total	Seventeen	3.0
Howd you get 17	I just added 15 and 2 together	3.0
Think about what you can maybe do next	I got my answer	0.0
Elise what should we try next	Times five	3.0
What can I do next to my ratio table to try and get the total to 85	Do 17 x 5	3.0
Now did you know that 17 x five was 85	Yes	0.0
Clarissa will you share your strategy with us	That was my strategy	0.0
Brendan	My strategy was I added the first column times two	3.0
Okay	Then the next column times 3	3.0
What did you multiply times three	The second column	3.0
So that would be 90 and 12 and	102	3.0
Okay	Then I subtracted by the first column	3.0
Colten can you tell me whats going to happen	I think that	0.0
What do you need to take	Oh we need to do this problem	0.0
to get to 8	Im not exactly sure oil	2.0
How you got from 7 to 28	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I multiplied by 4	3.0
Ellen what did you do	I times it by 2 and then times it by 2 again	4.0
Ainsley is that what you got for your strategy	Yes	0.0
Im going to give you guys did three minutes feel like too much time or not enough time	Just the right time	0.0
Just the right time	I think it wasnt enough time	0.0
Yeah Deacon go ahead	I went to a furniture and  it was like the last day and they were trying to do a really big sale	0.0
Or did they just say its a big sale	I wasnt paying attention too much but	0.0
Did you guys get any new furniture	Not yet we were just looking around	0.0
Like at the mall Yeah Bill	Well I didnt really see any but my parents went furniture shopping because they said there were a bunch of sales	0.0
Yeah	Were getting a new house so were looking for new furniture	0.0
Do you want to give us a fraction equivalent for 10 25 50 or 75	Sorry I turned my camera on instead of my microphone	0.0
Sorry I turned my camera on instead of my microphone	10 maybe	3.0
Okay whats the fraction equivalent for 10	You could do ten hundredths	3.0
Okay Bronwyn do you agree with that disagree with that or have a question about what were learning	I couldnt hear I cant really hear that	0.0
Can you hear me	Yeah I can hear you	0.0
She said ten onehundredths	Yeah I agree with that	1.0
Caleb are you going to tell us	You could do one over 10	3.0
Christie do you want to do 25 50 or 75	I could do 25 since its the next one	0.0
All right what fraction would that be equivalent to	Im not exactly sure but could it be 25 over 100	3.0
Okay Bronwyn do you agree disagree or have a question	I have a question how	2.0
I have a question how	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I just dont really understand that	2.0
So you started with how can you finish your sentence for how	How did she get 25 over 100	2.0
Christie how did you get 25 over 100	I got 25 over 100 because 100 can go under 25	4.0
Robert do you want to take that one	Because if you have a whole which is 100 and you take 25 of that it would be 25 from 100	4.0
Franc what would you like to add	Because the percent sign percent means 100 and  that percent means 100	4.0
Deacon what do you think	25 is also one quarter	3.0
Bill which one would you like to do	Ill do 75	0.0
Lets hear it	Three fourths	3.0
Do you agree disagree or have a question	I agree	1.0
How do you know thats right	Because 75 is three fourths of 100	4.0
How do you know that its 34s	Because of 25 50 75	4.0
Alfie what do you think	I think its equivalent to one half	3.0
What are your thoughts there	I agree that 50 is equivalent to one half of 100	1.0
Yeah because 50 is half of a hundred	Yeah hes right	1.0
So go ahead and hop on Forest in your Google Classroom today	Theres two Forest	0.0
Its Jasper for you	Which Forest should I use	0.0
So not the benchmark fractions one	Is it a Forest	0.0
Mmhmm	Why	0.0
For the green one what percent is shaded in and how do you know	Because that would be one tenth and one tenth is	4.0
Because that would be one tenth and one tenth is	Ten goes into 100 ten times you also do 1 x 10	4.0
What did you say what percent shaded in	I said 50	3.0
How did you know that it was 50	Because if you	0.0
Because if you	I did it as a fraction at first I got one half or one over two	4.0
I did it as a fraction at first I got one half or one over two	And so I thought whats half of 100 and I got 50	4.0
Can you tell us what fraction or what percent is shaded in	75	3.0
How did you get 75	and then they added one more	3.0
What is this divided up into	Four	3.0
Howd we do	I have a question on B	2.0
Sure	So is it since its half that means its 50	3.0
Yeah just like Nash said and Leslie said that half of a hundred is 50	Oh okay	0.0
Im going to have MNashna can you read your response that you wrote on slide three	I wrote  divided by two so when you divide by two its easier to find 50	4.0
Kabir P will you also read yours	All you have to do is halve the number because 50 is half of 100	4.0
And Joanna will you read your response	I said Just go back	0.0
I said Just go back	50 means half so you can just divide the number by two	4.0
So Im going to start with Meredith Meredith can you read your strategy for how you found 10 of something	So to find 10 I just divided the number by 10	4.0
So to find 10 I just divided the number by 10	So if you divide 10 by 10 for 10 liters of milk you get one	4.0
Deacon what is 10 of a 2000 kilometer trip what would that be	That would be 200	3.0
Yeah what would 10 of a 24 hour day be	Like 2	3.0
If you divide 24 by 10 what would we get	24	3.0
Yeah Alfie	I cant do the share with the class thing because my computer doesnt let me	0.0
So dont write anything new	Im a little confused	2.0
Yeah whats up Bronwyn	Im just confused on how you got 24	2.0
So now the 2 that was in the 10s place is in the 1s place	Oh okay	0.0
And the 4 that was in the 1s place is in the tenths place	And then 10 is the hour but why would you divide them by 10 not 2	2.0
Because were finding 10	Oh	0.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Thank you	0.0
Well go back to this picture in yellow its 75	You could divide by three	3.0
And Kalen that would give us what one fourth would be	25	3.0
Which is 25 mmhmm	And then you can multiply it by three	3.0
So Kalen what was your first step to be able to find 75	Divide the first number by four	3.0
What was your next step Kalen	Multiply the number you got from dividing by four times three	3.0
Well check it will it mark it right if you write it like that	Yeah it does	0.0
So Meredith will you help me with the first one	Sorry can you repeat that	0.0
Can you help me with the first one	Yeah so I did 10 divided by 75 and I got 75	4.0
So lets do this lets do 10 divided by 4 what would 10 divided by 4 be	10 divided by 4 would be	0.0
And sometimes when I divide by four I like to divide it in half and then divide my half in half again	Okay that would be 25	3.0
Absolutely so thats one fourth	And then you would multiply by three	3.0
And what would that be	That would be 75	3.0
With the 2000 kilometer trip	Im just not really sure how to do it	2.0
So what would 20 divided by 4 be	5	3.0
So then were going to take 500 and multiply it by 3 and what would that give us	300	3.0
Does that make sense Nadia	Yeah	0.0
All right the next one there Kabir P can you walk us through how to find three fourths of a 24 hour day	Okay so you divide 24 by 4 getting 6 and then 6 times 3 is 18	4.0
Kaysen Im not sure what youre pasting into the answer boxes but it doesnt look like what were up to right now okay	Oh I have an answer I just need to answer	0.0
Are you there Magnus	Yeah Im thinking	0.0
What would that be	150 maybe	3.0
What would the whole be	18	3.0
So if I go back to my first slide and I say okay 10 is equal to 9	T half of 9 wouldnt it be 45	3.0
So if you take 18 and you find 50 of it that would be 9	Oh	0.0
Lets see Deacon what do you think	That would be 100	3.0
That would be 100	Wait are we on C	0.0
Im on C yeah	So 100 would be	0.0
So 100 would be	So do you want me to find 100 or 10	2.0
So if 9 is 10 what number would be 100	That would be 90	3.0
Kalen you are on a streak my friend what do you think	I got 36	3.0
Okay howd you get 36	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	So I did 100 divided by 4	3.0
So I did 100 divided by 4	I solved this really strange	0.0
Would you like to share your idea Leslie	Yeah I did 9 times 4	3.0
Right that is a great strategy why did you do 9 times 4	Because 25 times 4 is 100	4.0
Because 25 times 4 is 100	And so	0.0
So what are you thinking Alfie	I really dont know	2.0
What do you guys think	I think you would add	3.0
So youre looking for a small numerator does that tell you that you have a smaller fraction	Yeah	0.0
Wyatt go for it	Basically Im just looking for a high denominator and a low numerator	3.0
Basically Im just looking for a high denominator and a low numerator	Because if the denominators high and the numernate whats it called	2.0
Numerator	Numerators small then basically you have a pretty small number	3.0
Theodore do you want to go for it	Should I just tell the answer	0.0
Which two numbers would you pick	I would pick 110 and 16	3.0
So Leo can you tell us what is a strategy that we might be able to use to solve this problem	So with the bottom number I forget which one it is numerators or	2.0
Numerators on top denominators on the bottom	With the denominator you want to find two numbers that and for the top one you want to find something thats going to equal half of that	3.0
Sammie is there anything you feel like we could eliminate	Yeah 910 because it exceeds what we need	4.0
Okay anything else we can eliminate Rose	78	3.0
How come	For the same reason	1.0
Arriana do you see anything else we can eliminate because it already exceeds what were looking for	Possibly 48 because its already half	4.0
Theodore what are you thinking	110 because its definitely too little	4.0
Well we might add 110 to something later	Oh we can add	0.0
Yeah Carter whats up	Cross out 48 if it sums out to be one half	4.0
Mack since I have you are there any other cards we can eliminate that are more than one half	Im thinking 110	3.0
Well we could add 110 to something else Theodore do you see what we could eliminate	34	3.0
Hunter what are your thoughts	I dont know if this goes over or not but 38 and 16	3.0
So Hunter which are the two you wanted to try and add together	16 and 38	3.0
Valarie your brain is just going going whats up	Would 24 be one	3.0
So 1324 what do you guys think about that	Its close	3.0
Its really close to half how close to half is it	One	3.0
One fraction whats the size of that fraction	Its 124 away	3.0
I see youve got your hand Arriana what are you thinking	40	3.0
How close is that one	140	3.0
Are you there Julia	Yeah sorry I think 1940 is going to be closer to one half	3.0
Yeah what are you thinking Hunter	The problem says to circle the two numbers who	3.0
Did we circle the two numbers whos sum is closest to one half without equaling one half	Yes	0.0
Was I right	Yeah	0.0
Did you hear somebody say that	Thats what we said	0.0
Whats a number that we can count by threes and we can count by fives and theyll land on the same number	15	3.0
So 1615 Theodore	Can I tell the answer to the whole	0.0
Sure	It would be 14 and 115	3.0
Yeah Hunter	I feel I lost track of what were doing	2.0
I feel I lost track of what were doing	How did you get three and one	2.0
Arriana what do you think		3.0
What did we multiply by	18 Wait	3.0
What did I multiply by	Multiply by six	3.0
To get from six to 18 Hunter what did I multiply by	Three	3.0
Julia what should I do next	Sorry I know you asked me a question but you cut out I only heard my name	0.0
What are we going to do next	Next we are going to I would make it into a mixed fraction	3.0
No three plus five	Five plus three is eight	4.0
And then whats 1218 plus 1518	So that would be 27	3.0
What should we do next Sammie	You should probably get that 27 down to a non whats it called	2.0
How many times will 18 go into 27	Once it wouldnt go twice	3.0
Yep and then what would be left over	Four	3.0
Well Im going to count up from 18 to 27	Sorry 10	3.0
Yeah Sammie do you want to take this one	It would be nine and one half	3.0
And thats our final answer for this sum	I just wanted to point out one thing	0.0
I just wanted to point out one thing	In the very first thing we did how we thought the common factor was 18 sorry common multiple was 18	3.0
In the very first thing we did how we thought the common factor was 18 sorry common multiple was 18	Another common multiple that I think would have been a little simpler was just six	3.0
Wyatt P what do you think that a common multiple between five and eight could be	40	3.0
Juniper what do I need to multiply five by in order to get to 40	Eight	3.0
So we have 3240 and Julia what are we going to multiply 58 by	By five	3.0
Okay Arriana help me add these together	So you add two and 10 which would be 12 then if you added the two numerators you would get 57	4.0
So you add two and 10 which would be 12 then if you added the two numerators you would get 57	But its a reverse number so you have to do	4.0
So 5740	And then I did 57 minus 40 to get my answer and I got 17	4.0
Okay keep going	And that would be 13 and	3.0
Okay I want you guys to try number three independently	T	0.0
T	So I get everything else Im just confused of once you have 12 and 57 how that goes to 12 plus 17 over 40	2.0
Does that help you out Valarie	Yes	0.0
Yeah Hunter	Im confused so I get how you do two and four is 12 and then you add the five and the eight and then you add two more that would be 14	4.0
Im confused so I get how you do two and four is 12 and then you add the five and the eight and then you add two more that would be 14	But then how do you And then you times five times eight and eight times five but then what do you do after that really	2.0
But basically I have to add my numerators but keep my denominators the same and dont add those together	Oh	0.0
Yeah Harmony	Can you hear me	0.0
Yeah I can hear you	Okay I was just wondering because Im a little bit confused on the part where you put it that way and then its 12 plus one 17th and 40th	2.0
Okay I was just wondering because Im a little bit confused on the part where you put it that way and then its 12 plus one 17th and 40th	I dont know how to get that	2.0
Does that make sense	Okay yeah it does but I was working on number three and then I got 19 over	3.0
Yeah lets look at this one you guys ready to tackle this one	So would it just be that and the	0.0
So one two three		3.0
Theodore what do you think	Two	3.0
What would that be crew		3.0
And then lets add our fractions together and what would we get		3.0
Do you guys have any questions about that one	Miss I get everything except how we do the nine over 24 and ten	2.0
You mean like how we got to those equivalent fractions	Yeah	0.0
So I have to	No I know that	0.0
Oh okay then whats your question sorry	I dont get how you got the nine over 24 and the 10 over 24	2.0
Not really	Not really	2.0
Can you ask it and maybe someone else can help me out	I just dont understand how you got seven and 924 plus five with 1024	2.0
Does somebody think they can explain it to Aubree	I can explain it	0.0
Yeah Valarie go for it	So basically so youre finding the lowest common factor of both numbers	3.0
The lowest common multiple yep	And since eight and 12 both go into 24 and its the lowest one then you times that and the numerator by it	4.0
And since eight and 12 both go into 24 and its the lowest one then you times that and the numerator by it	And then you	0.0
And then you	Oh okay	0.0
Hey Valarie I think you should have my job	No yeah thank you	0.0
And then I guess tomorrow well tackle subtraction	Can I say I relearnt	0.0
Which problem would you like to start with Alani	The first one	0.0
Which box would you like to start with	The firstthe column	3.0
What should I do first	So I did 20x4 and I got 80	4.0
You may ask a question or tell me what to do next	Then I did 4x7	3.0
Okay and what did you get		3.0
I dont see NicoleWhats our last step Josiah	We need to add the numbers together	3.0
And what would we get		3.0
Or first I should say	Well I did 40 well I set up the table and then I did 40x30	3.0
In order to get 30x40 what would that be		3.0
Colton which one would you like to do next	Am I allowed to do 35x42	3.0
No because when we use an area model notice how we set it up we put up the 35 into 30 and 5	Oh yeah so wouldnt we just do 5x40	3.0
Yeah what would that be	Wouldnt that be 200	3.0
Landon which one would you like to tackle	30x2	0.0
And what would that be		3.0
Im going to let you tackle this Santiago which is this last column which 2 numbers are we going to multiply for the area here	5x2	3.0
Yeah whats 5x2		3.0
Love it thank you Alani thank you Shebby	I have to go grab something downstairs	0.0
So Im going to do a few for you	What page is it	0.0
Im going to do a few for you but just like when we did our warm up today I want you guys to be ready to answer some questions for me today	What page is it	0.0
Yeah Camilla	So for multiplying 510 you dont need to find the common denominator right	3.0
So for multiplying 510 you dont need to find the common denominator right	You just multiply 2x5 and 5x8	3.0
Yep and on the next page were going to draw some pictures and talk about why that is	Okay and then is it the Finleye for division	3.0
We will talk about division later	Okay	0.0
Yes Gemma	So I get that you consideredand thats equal to 364	3.0
So I get that you consideredand thats equal to 364	Im just confused on how that equals the 9	2.0
Yeah so 4 will go into 36 nine times	Oh thank you	0.0
Santiago C	4x5	0.0
4x5 and what would that be		3.0
Josiah where would you like to go next	The column off to the right	0.0
Okay what are we going to multiply there	3x4 times 23	0.0
And what would that be		3.0
Cool all right Rene youre next which one would you like to do	I guess 5 times 24	0.0
Okay tell me what I should do to solve that problem	I guess its just 34 5 times	3.0
I guess its just 34 5 times	Or 34 times 54 which is 154	4.0
Cool will you simplify it into a mixed number	12 and	3.0
Youre right 4 would go into this to get to 12	Sorry its 3	3.0
Santiago P what should we do next	Well do 4 times 23	3.0
And then 2 goes into 8 four times right	Mmhmm	0.0
Crew what would a common denominator be between 3 and 4 and 2	12	3.0
Landon what do you think	I think it would be 12	3.0
Yes maam	Would this work instead of doing all the steps for an area model can you find a common denominator of those two and then multiply it or does that not work	2.0
So you do not need to find the common denominator when you multiply	Well what I mean is 4 34 x 5 23 and you can make it 12	4.0
Yeah you dont need to do that	Okay	0.0
Trinity what do you think we should do first	Couldnt you do 7 times 56	3.0
Leilani what should we do next	56 times 34	3.0
Yeah can you help me solve this one	Sure	0.0
What should I do first	5x3	3.0
Yep	And thats 15	3.0
And thats 15	6x4 is 30	4.0
Youre close its 24	Oh 24	0.0
Rene what do you think it is		3.0
Do you agree Miles	Landon	0.0
Brenden do you agree	Yes	0.0
Lucille did you have a question for me	I dont remember what I was going to say	0.0
I want you to write that down so that you tell your brain what to look for while youre learning today	What is a tape diagram	2.0
Okay Robert	Yeah	0.0
Do you want to count with me up here	Yeah	0.0
Keep counting with me	Two	0.0
Okay	Three	0.0
Three	Four	0.0
Yeah Adeline	What happens if it isnt exact	2.0
Yeah Adeline	Will we have to write a number sentence on the test	0.0
Lucas P what part of our number sentence when we have seven what does seven represent	Seven represents what number you divided by two	3.0
In our number sentence Adeline what does two represent	Two represents thewhat were dividing	3.0
Is it the size of the groups or the number of groups	Number of groups	3.0
Briella what do you think	Could we do a half	3.0
Could we do a half	So three and a half	3.0
Xavier what are your thoughts about three and a half being our answer	I think its right because seven cant be cut in half because its an odd number	4.0
I think its right because seven cant be cut in half because its an odd number	So I think it would be three and three is six and then the two halves can make a whole and that would equal up to seven	4.0
So I think it would be three and three is six and then the two halves can make a whole and that would equal up to seven	So I think its three and a half	4.0
So this piece would have to have one more piece right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How is that three and a half	2.0
Kind of in the middle right there	What was  done before	0.0
What was  done before	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	But both of them	3.0
And over here one two three and then this half	Well yeah because only one of the threes took the half and it wouldnt be seven	4.0
Well yeah because only one of the threes took the half and it wouldnt be seven	Because you need both the threes that would equal six and you need both the halves	4.0
Because you need both the threes that would equal six and you need both the halves	Because the other halves make a whole and then its a whole number	4.0
Allen how many times do you think that twothirds fits into one whole	I think	0.0
I think	Can you go over	2.0
Can you go over	Or is does it have to be exact	2.0
Its going to be the answer is going to be an exact number	Oh	0.0
Oh	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I think you could divide it	4.0
So I think you could divide it	Divide twothirds by two to get like you could divide the numerator	4.0
Divide twothirds by two to get like you could divide the numerator	So you can get onethird and then add that maybe	4.0
So do you think are you thinking one and onethird	Yeah	0.0
Kendall what are you thinking	Did you just call my name	0.0
Yeah	Oh	0.0
Oh	What was the question	0.0
How many times does twothirds fit into one whole	Um	0.0
Um	Twice	3.0
So Remy what do you think	I guess this probably isnt right but maybe one and a half	3.0
Remy can you explain where you got one and a half from	Since twothirds is being treated as like well its not being treated as a whole but	4.0
Since twothirds is being treated as like well its not being treated as a whole but	I dont really know how to explain this but like twothirds is this other number that is being multiplied or added	4.0
Yeah its the size of our group	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And one whole would be the extra half of twothirds	4.0
And one whole would be the extra half of twothirds	So I just put one and a half	4.0
Yeah Briella	I was just going to say I agree  because I know that one group	4.0
I was just going to say I agree  because I know that one group	I put one with two groups so then I made the next little square another third and then I added those twothirds then I got three over three	4.0
I put one with two groups so then I made the next little square another third and then I added those twothirds then I got three over three	And I also know that it equals one whole	4.0
And I also know that it equals one whole	So I added that to one and	4.0
Yeah Adeline	If were dividing one divided by twothirds how did we get something bigger than one	2.0
Yes Briella	Would this happen most of the time whenever theres a left number like little space equal to onehalf	3.0
I hope I didnt zoom in too much here how many threefourths are in one whole	Why is the whole so big	2.0
This little part right here	Um no	0.0
Um no	Yeah yeah	0.0
Is that better	Yeah	0.0
What fraction of the part is that	Is it onethird	3.0
Collin do you agree disagree or have a question about Liliths proposal	I agree	1.0
How come you agree	Oh because I was kind of just what I got too I guess	1.0
Howd you get that too	I did the	0.0
Your answer for that one would be one and onethird	How would it why wouldnt it be threefourths	2.0
So when we look at this do you see how I circled threefourths will fit into one whole one time right	Oh	0.0
Do you see how this would fit in one two three times	Kind of	0.0
So if I took this little piece here	It could fit in all three of them	3.0
So that would be onethird	Because one square	4.0
Yeah Giselle	Why wouldnt it be onefourth	2.0
Because youre right that its onefourth of a whole but it is one third of the size of the piece that we are dividing things into	Oh okay	0.0
Yeah Adeline	So the answer would be one and onethird	3.0
Yeah Allaya	Since we already know that onethird is equal like theres one and onethird in one could we just have one and a half plus one and a half plus one and a half	4.0
Yeah Xavier	Would it be onefourth because one could go into each  can go into each two times	4.0
We want to know how many times this piecelike we want to know this piece what fraction of a part is it	That would be onehalf	3.0
So youre proposing half	Yeah	0.0
Adeline what are you thinking	I am actually a little confused	2.0
I am actually a little confused	Why the tape line why did they get into that many spaces	2.0
Because we had three wholes and I had heres one	Oh got it	0.0
Two and then I divided it into thirds because I needed to do groups of twothirds	So when you  you put it into all of them do you count all empty spaces	3.0
Is that what Im hearing you say Xavier	Yeah	0.0
So Dominick do you agree disagree or have a question with Xaviers proposal	I agree	1.0
How come you agree	Because therere four sections and they each have two in them	4.0
Because therere four sections and they each have two in them	Well its kind of hard to explain but I agree	1.0
Do you want to explain it	So theres four of them	4.0
So theres four of them	And each of them have two in it and if you put that one block on one of the four so theres that would be four wholes and onehalf because you took a part of it off so theres only one	4.0
Yeah it took up exactly half of each one of the parts	Yeah	0.0
You mean write it as a mixed number	Yeah	0.0
So youd rather do five divided by what Allaya	That would be one and onehalf	3.0
Lets do it	Wait but why would the three and the two be threehalves if its not like three	2.0
Wait but why would the three and the two be threehalves if its not like three	Because the two goes into three once and then three minus two is onehalf	4.0
Because the two goes into three once and then three minus two is onehalf	Oh	0.0
Oh	So then thats the two in the denominator and one	1.0
So then thats the two in the denominator and one	All right	0.0
Allaya is proposing three and a third here	I agree	1.0
What do you think about that	I have a question	2.0
Lets hear it	How did you guys got three and onethird	2.0
Briella do you want to explain it	Yeah but Im not sure if Im correct but	2.0
Xavier is like his ears  hes totally ready to help you	So that left over square would fit into one of those other squares	4.0
So that left over square would fit into one of those other squares	Like the one on the left side it would fit in with onethird of that square	4.0
Like the one on the left side it would fit in with onethird of that square	So it would be three and onethird because it fits into that square and it takes like onethird	4.0
What do you think about that Xavier	Yeah thats correct	1.0
So its taking up onethird of a piece	Yeah its not three	4.0
Yeah its not three	Since theres only one so we only take off onethird of it	4.0
Yes Sabrina	I dont get this	2.0
I dont get this	Like if theres a square in between	2.0
Like if theres a square in between	Well so if theres like dont think of the square doing anything	1.0
Well so if theres like dont think of the square doing anything	The square doesnt actually matter	1.0
The square doesnt actually matter	Just imagine you move the pieces all together so theres three still and then you just pick up that one and put it in the spot and then it would still be	4.0
I just	The gaps in the middle arent anything	3.0
The gaps in the middle arent anything	Theyre just there	3.0
Yeah Adeline	So I know you divide it but Im still a little confused	2.0
So I know you divide it but Im still a little confused	So I dont know why we put the squares in between	2.0
So I just wanted you guys to see where one is or where two is three	Oh got it	0.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Lucas did you get your question answered sweetie	Yes	0.0
What do you think Allaya	Would that be twothirds	3.0
Crew youre doing such a good job understanding what it really means to divide fractions	Theyre kind of easy	0.0
Royce	Can you answer	0.0
I hope you have time to do that this afternoon	Oh	0.0
Its going to be more than two seconds	20 seconds	0.0
Im almost done	Five	0.0
Five	Four	0.0
You can just tell me	Four	3.0
Four	24	1.0
24	Four	1.0
I feel like I could teach the next problem	Theres also an easier way in the book	0.0
You could teach college students	How about half a finger for a half	0.0
Yeah	I think well if youre doing the next number as an improper fraction wouldnt you multiply the two by four to get eight	4.0
Mmhmm	Then you add the ones	3.0
Mmhmm	Thats right	0.0
Thats right	Yeah then you add the ones to make the 90s or something	3.0
Its just going to be 94	94	0.0
what should we do first	Find the common denominator	3.0
Okay  between two and eight what is our common denominator	Four	3.0
Say that again	Eight	3.0
To get from two to eight were going to multiply by four	I thought you were asking me for that	0.0
what are we going to do next	Then you would multiply eight times three plus four	4.0
Cool	Where did you get 288	2.0
Lets do Royce	Is it okay if I say it	0.0
Yeah you can say it	We got it because you put the three into it and got three and 48 to a how do I say it	4.0
We got it because you put the three into it and got three and 48 to a how do I say it	Improper fraction	4.0
Improper fraction	Then we use the three to take it time eight and thats 24 plus four is 28	4.0
I have three wholes there and if they each have eight pieces that would be 24 pieces the size of 18	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	I remember Royce in fifth grade	0.0
I remember Royce in fifth grade	You go eight times three which is 24	4.0
You go eight times three which is 24	Oh sorry	0.0
Yeah you were right	24 and then you do plus four	3.0
whats our next step	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	The mute button was on mute	0.0
The mute button was on mute	You divide 28 divided by five	3.0
Can you help us write this as a mixed number	It would be five and 35	3.0
do you agree Cassidy or have a question	I agree	1.0
Well how do you know thats correct	Five goes into 28 five times and then theres 35 left over	4.0
Were going to draw a couple of diagrams on the next one just to make sure we feel super solid on what this also represents	How did you get the denominator of five on there	2.0
When I did 285 I said five goes into 28 five times and then theres three pieces that are the size of 15 left over	You make it into a fraction	3.0
Yeah	Nevermind	0.0
Yep right there	Even if we were  couldnt we just do five and 35 times the other number to get a  number	3.0
What I want to tell you if you can tell me why that works when you come to school on Thursday I will let you use it but until you can totally explain not how it works but why it works Im going to ask you to use this common denominator strategy	Okay	0.0
Would you guys like to use a number line or a tape diagram	Number line	0.0
Number line	Number line	0.0
Remember we did geometry in August and September	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	I was just	0.0
do you want to share your idea	16 would just be half of 13	4.0
Okay keep going	Then you can also do the same 16 26 36 46	4.0
13 is the same as 26 right	Yep	0.0
Yeah Brennan	Theres also a way but I dont know how to explain it at the moment	2.0
Rylan what should I do first	Multiply 23 by two	3.0
Yeah by 22	Yeah	0.0
What will that give me	46	3.0
Celeste what should I do next	You divide those two	3.0
Okay and whats that going to give me when I divide	One and	3.0
Four divided by five which equals we can just say 4 over five	Fifths	3.0
Yeah	I thought of another number one because its like	0.0
Yeah	Would that be the same for any number like that	3.0
Would that be the same for any number like that	Whats just an example	2.0
Whats just an example	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	78 and 56 would that be seven what was my other number	2.0
Theyd have to have a common denominator so the example that you gave didnt have a common denominator	Okay well there was an example like I dont know 13 and 39	3.0
Okay well there was an example like I dont know 13 and 39	Could that be able to I dont know	2.0
If we did 13 divided by 23 your answer would be 12	But how	2.0
That fraction bar is a division sign divided by two	The threes cancel out technically	3.0
They just tell us Okay youre dealing with the same size piece here	I have a question	2.0
Sure  whats up	Im a bit confused because I thought you said to do this on the problems that you said that they had to have this  because	2.0
Okay let me shade in 23 here	This is a tape diagram	3.0
Yeah this is a tape diagram	Okay	0.0
Thats where 45 comes from	Oh because theres a total of five pieces but theres four pieces out of the five	4.0
I just put it there to show you what one whole looks like	But then why would you shade the five	2.0
56 is the size of our piece that were dividing up into	Oh	0.0
Theres five and 12 and were going to split up into pieces that are the size of four so four is the size of one of our groups	What page is this on	0.0
Brooks what do you think	I think its 12	3.0
what do you think	I agree	1.0
Any other thoughts	Agree	1.0
Brennan what do you think	Im not completely sure yet but it might be one and 13	3.0
Rylan what do you think	34	3.0
One and 34 or just 34	Just 34	3.0
Yeah Royce	I was	0.0
Briar	Can I share ideas or no	0.0
Do you have a proposal for an answer	12	3.0
Briar well start with you	Okay I would support the one that I went with the one and 12	3.0
Okay I would support the one that I went with the one and 12	Its not 12	1.0
Its not 12	What	0.0
What	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	What is he saying	0.0
Go for it Samson	Theres that one there so it cant be any less than one	4.0
Okay	Theres four out of five and then since that 12 well one and 12 is there and one and 12 plus one and 12 or one and 12 times two is actually four so that would have to be half of 34 so it would be one and 12	4.0
Caelen what are you thinking	Yeah I agree	1.0
Yeah I agree	I think one and 12 too	1.0
Uhhuh	See you started with a total of five and 12 and you can divide that by four but since you already have  You just have to circle the groups of four	4.0
See you started with a total of five and 12 and you can divide that by four but since you already have  You just have to circle the groups of four	Since you circled the first group of four theres one and 12 remaining except if you divide five by four and stuff you cant and you get a fraction or a decimal	4.0
Since you circled the first group of four theres one and 12 remaining except if you divide five by four and stuff you cant and you get a fraction or a decimal	You put that 12 left over from that	4.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Sawyer what are you thinking	Actually can you	0.0
Rylan what are you thinking	I think its 34 because if you have if two would be another 12 of four and then if you divide them all into fourths theres one two 34 of 12	4.0
I see youre thinking like you have 34 here	Yeah	0.0
Right here do we all agree you have one whole set here one whole group here	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	1.0
Yeah Sawyer	Im actually going to say one and 38	3.0
Do you want so support your answer	Well because its less than 42 which means	4.0
Okay cut these four in half	Then you would have eighths	3.0
Okay	You have two	3.0
Yeah Samson	The weird thing was I actually had that on my paper but for some reason I blanked	0.0
Yeah	I have to leave in three minutes	0.0
Can you get us started with this one	Yeah I love this strategy	0.0
All right go for it my friend	All right	0.0
All right	Three times three is nine	4.0
Okay	Then that plus two is 113	4.0
Then that plus two is 113	Yeah 113	3.0
Do you want to keep doing the next one Soren	Okay	0.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
What would that be	Put that two and 13	3.0
Okay and what would that be	Then you do 11 as	3.0
Wait two and 13 how would we write that as an improper fraction	Two times three equals six	4.0
Two times three equals six	Six plus one equals seven	4.0
What should we do for our next step	Divide	3.0
What would our final answer be	One and 47	3.0
Samson do you agree Cassidy or have a question	I agree	1.0
I have to go	Is there any homework I have to do	0.0
Yep please finish this page that we had in your notes today or that we started this morning	Okay thank you	0.0
Yeah Celeste	Were we not supposed to do problem number two	0.0
Did you already do it	Yeah	0.0
What	I already did it	0.0
Does that sound okay	Yeah	0.0
Brooks whats a common denominator between four and eight	Eight	3.0
If we multiply the numerator and the denominator by two whats an equivalent fraction	Are you asking me	0.0
Yeah	Oh	0.0
Oh	It would be 68	3.0
What would our final answer be Royce	Six	3.0
Six what	Six cups	3.0
Six divided by one	Or scoops excuse me	3.0
What was the strategy you take	Im not going to spell it	0.0
What is the strategy you like to use to divide a fraction by a fraction	I was going to describe the one where you did the common denominator and you did I forget what it was	3.0
I was going to describe the one where you did the common denominator and you did I forget what it was	Im going to look at my notes	0.0
Okay	someone else while I find it	0.0
Colette S what did you write for work C	I was thinking basically the same thing as Brighton	1.0
I was thinking basically the same thing as Brighton	Basically you find the least common multiple	3.0
Yeah	After you  the multiple	3.0
What were you thinking	Find a common denominator	3.0
Yeah	I think we were taught in fourth grade to just do it like this	3.0
what do you think	I think it would be 18 and 12 because it was 34 and now theres only two of them so it would be 24 and 24 is equal to 12	4.0
what do you think	I have a feeling its the exact same thing	1.0
Yeah Chance	I was thinking maybe it would be 23	3.0
Because	Since theres 34 and you only have 2 of them	4.0
Since theres 34 and you only have 2 of them	Then thered be 23 of 34	4.0
Our second problem Yeah	Couldnt you just do nine times three because its 13 so you would multiply nine times three	4.0
How come nine times three would work	I dont know but whenever its a whole number thats divided by a fraction thats just one part of a fraction like 13	4.0
I dont know but whenever its a whole number thats divided by a fraction thats just one part of a fraction like 13	I just multiply the whole number by the denominator	4.0
Yeah	I think it works because when dividing fractions dividing different pieces you try to figure out how many into the thing like how big it is	4.0
I think it works because when dividing fractions dividing different pieces you try to figure out how many into the thing like how big it is	For that 34 one you got 18	4.0
For that 34 one you got 18	Inside of 14 you got 18 because its only 34 of that 14 and youre trying to figure out how many times that 34 can go into that 14	4.0
Inside of 14 you got 18 because its only 34 of that 14 and youre trying to figure out how many times that 34 can go into that 14	18 times because its bigger	4.0
18 times because its bigger	You multiply by the denominator its also like dividing the fraction because youre just finding how many times that number goes into another number	4.0
Stetson what are you thinking	I guess because nine times three equals 27 and theres three pieces in every nine pizzas I guess	4.0
Mmhmm	When you multiply three times nine youll get the proper number I guess	3.0
Mathland what questions do you guys have	I had a question	2.0
Sure	When its nine divided by 14 do you have to do all the work times four or can you just do nine times the denominator	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
All right crew	I have a question	2.0
Whats up	Can we use a number line too to find this out or do we have to	3.0
Absolutely	Okay	0.0
Okay	T	0.0
Yeah Sweetie	Couldnt you just multiply nine times four	3.0
Do you know why that works	Because its only onesomething	4.0
Make sure you know why that strategy works	All right	0.0
Okay	I have another question	2.0
Sure	Are we just doing how many times can nine go into each one	3.0
Whats up Deborah	Ive got two	0.0
Ive got two	I didnt realize I had two	0.0
What is my division sentence for this one	Would it be 15 divided by 23	3.0
How does that change your sentence	Oh divided by nine	3.0
Oh divided by nine	Yeah why is it nine	2.0
She has nine blocks of cheese	No	0.0
No	I thought we were doing the one under it	0.0
We have 15 of a block	Okay	0.0
What would your number sentence be	We have nine so would we do nine	3.0
We have nine so would we do nine	Wait Im a little bit confused	2.0
What are the size of the pieces were going to divide it into	The size of the pizzas so if we have nine cheese  We have nine pizzas	3.0
No we have nine blocks of cheese	Nine blocks of cheese divided by 15	3.0
Whats an algorithm we can use	Im just a little bit confused on the algorithm part	2.0
Im just a little bit confused on the algorithm part	I dont really get how youre supposed to set it up and stuff	2.0
Between one and five what could our common denominator be	Five	3.0
If we draw our picture over here Yeah	That makes more sense	3.0
Whats our division sentence going to be	Nine divided by 23	3.0
What should we do	Set up	3.0
Set up	I think you would	0.0
I think you would	Im sorry	0.0
Im sorry	Nine over one	3.0
Sure	Then you have one divided by 23	3.0
Cool	Then three is the common denominator	3.0
Good job Sweetie	Then three times nine is 27 over three and two over three and then do you do 27 divided by two	4.0
You absolutely do	Okay	0.0
Which we can also write as 272	Oh	0.0
Yeah Sterling	I was just going to say that its half	3.0
How do you know that its half	Divided in half of two that was one	4.0
Divided in half of two that was one	It would be 135	4.0
Try your model	I think this is the same as that because this  as 23	4.0
Thats 33	Oh	0.0
Oh	I dont know why I	0.0
It looks close	Sorry	0.0
Why do you think the division works	I think its just because of how many times a fraction can go into a whole number which is a lot more than it would be if you were just dividing a number by another whole number	4.0
Flip over to your other page	The first one	0.0
We started by having three times as many but then we divided them into groups of two	Yeah	0.0
Thats why when you think about it thats why if you flip it it will still work as a strategy	Okay	0.0
Yeah	Do we just count this as one so this would just be 27	3.0
One block if you have nine blocks and each of them takes one block that would be nine pizzas right	Mmhmm	0.0
Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work	Hmm	0.0
Did you think more about why multiplying and then dividing would work	I understand why it would work just one of something but I dont see how it would work with 23	2.0
You have this beautiful diagram here	Yeah so over here 36 I thought would maybe be like	4.0
Yeah so over here 36 I thought would maybe be like	I thought it would be nine times three because its 2 and then divided by two	4.0
You still have 27	Yeah but all these numbers here it would be just 39 times three divided by two but for nine times three I said that it was 36 and I got 18 for that	4.0
Mathland hows it going	Good	0.0
Yes Corrine	On question C 5 14 divided by three divided by one	3.0
If she wants to put 38 cup of frosting on each cupcake it would be divided by 38	Okay thank you	0.0
Okay thank you	I didnt see it	0.0
Try this one next	Is that the answer	0.0
It is	I dont think I got this one right	3.0
Four would go into 27 six times because six times four is 24 with 34 left over	Oh	0.0
If somebodys	How would you draw a model for it	2.0
How many times does four go into 27	Six times	3.0
With what left over	With three	3.0
34 left over	Oh	0.0
If it helps you to take this part and then to write it as a fraction you can definitely do that	Okay	0.0
Whitney do you want to talk about one or two or three	Im sorry that was my sister	0.0
Im sorry that was my sister	Ill try three	0.0
How do you think about that problem	I know  so I should just double eight so the answer would be 16	4.0
How would the diagram help us solve that problem	diagram you can make eight squares and then after that one half and then once you do it with one half you get One second Im not sure how do it with the diagram	4.0
Yeah Raul what do you think	I think it helps we can show it	3.0
How can we show it	We can make a circle I guess with two	3.0
Yeah Raul keep going	One and a half	3.0
How would you solve that one	T	0.0
Yeah	Am I frozen to you	0.0
Am I frozen to you	It looks like Im frozen	0.0
You are frozen to me yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	Im going to leave the meeting and come back	0.0
What does that mean	I would do	0.0
How many times can two go into eight	Four	3.0
How can we model problem number one	I think that we could model problem number one by  and then making it so that there is two groups of four	4.0
I think that we could model problem number one by  and then making it so that there is two groups of four	four equals eight	4.0
What have you  concession stand before	A fair	3.0

So have you guys ever been  McDonalds and how they sell the very popular quarter pounder	Yes	0.0
How much meat do you guys think the quarter pounder is	A quarter pound	3.0
And I do think its before grilling that its a quarter of a pound but still thats there go to a quarter pounder	But I thought it was a Big Mac	3.0
That is also their thing right	Yeah	0.0
Whats the difference between a Big Mac and a quarter pounder	You  quarter pounder but not as big	3.0
Yes	I think Big Macs have two patties or theyre a half pound	3.0
Im glad you guys have so much knowledge about this	Burgers	0.0
Hello Amalia whats up	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	I didnt mean to	0.0
So those seven eighths of a pound you can make seven one eighth pound patties	I have a question	2.0
Sure	Im confused on how it wouldnt just be just seven not seven and an eighth	2.0
Dos that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Or our equation	Seven eighths divided by two thirds	3.0
Amalia whats different about the first problem that we solved from the second problem that we are solving	Um its two eighths instead of one eighth	3.0
When you look at that diagram how much is left over Annie	Um is it one third	3.0
How much space is that	So	0.0

So whoever is your runners going to hold up their paper so I can see them	Okay	0.0
Does that sound all right	Yeah	0.0
Okay	seven eight	0.0
Raul are you guys ready	Dude	0.0
Hey team	Okay	0.0
Let me	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Im going to check on the other	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
Mmhmm	So we have to solve from the  from the	3.0
So	one third  is divided by	3.0
Yeah	solve the problem	3.0
And Whitney what would your number sentence be	two and three fourths divided by one eighth	3.0
Make sure that you are drawing a picture to represent that too okay Barbara	Okay	0.0
Yeah sweetie	So when we explain what your answer means what exactly are we just supposed to explain	2.0
So once you have youre going to explain what it actually means	Okay	0.0
Are you guys ready	No its not	0.0
No its not	Yes it is	0.0
Yes it is	It is	0.0
It is	No	0.0
Yeah	Hi	0.0
We can	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	So next question Raul	0.0
Have you restarted  recently	No	0.0
That might help a lot	Yep	0.0
That might help a lot but do that after class okay	All right	0.0
So	did mental math because I just thought of three divided by one to	3.0
I would have them draw out a number or draw a diagram to help you take two and three fourths and divide into groups that are the size of one fourth	right now	0.0
And then divide all of these up into fourths and see how many times one fourth will fit into two and three fourths okay	Wasnt	0.0
Hey Astrid Im ready for you sweetie	Got it	0.0
Got it	Okay	0.0
Okay	We	0.0
You guys are good to go to your next problem	common denominator	3.0
Okay	I think were done	0.0
Let me see	So heres	0.0
what	No	0.0
Did you guys write yours with a common denominator	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How many times just one 24ths go into 18 24ths	3.0
Exactly	We should probably	0.0
No it would be 18	Yeah	0.0
One 24th will go in 18 24ths 18 times	So its not 18	3.0
Does that make sense crew	Yes	0.0
Look at your picture	I know	0.0
I know	Its	0.0
So you basically said 18 24ths divided into groups that are the size of one 24th divided by	And then the  18	1.0
If that makes sense	Yeah	0.0
Hey Beatrice hows it going sweetie	I got 11	3.0
I got 11	We all got 11	1.0
Whitney would you like me to check a problem for you	Yeah	0.0
One fourth	So we didnt really  11	3.0
You guys say it	Subitizing	0.0
You guys say it again	Subitizing	0.0
For example when you roll a die and you look at it do you guys count the number of dots you see	Yeah	0.0
Do you	Well no I just	0.0
Or do you just look at it and youre like Oh I know that that pattern makes three	Oh yeah	0.0
You guys ready	Yeah	0.0
You ready	Yep	0.0
Is everybody ready	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
On your marks get set	Thats pattern two	0.0
For real you guys ready this time	Yeah	0.0
After those 20 seconds who do you think is going to go	B	0.0
Does that make sense	Yep	0.0
As your 20 minutes starts	20 minutes	0.0
As your 20 seconds start now	I dont know I did nine plus nine for the first dots and then I times that by two so	4.0
I dont know I did nine plus nine for the first dots and then I times that by two so	I add the dots up on this side six and on this side	1.0
Switch over to Bs	yeah because I saw them as dots so I saw them as nine dots and then I just kind of counted all how many parts there were and then	4.0
yeah because I saw them as dots so I saw them as nine dots and then I just kind of counted all how many parts there were and then	Yeah	1.0
Corbin lets start with you	I saw nine	3.0
Nine total	Yeah	0.0
Okay tell us how you saw nine	I saw that it was a square and then I counted the three on the side and then multiplied that by three	4.0
Okay awesome	Are we only supposed to do one square or all of them	0.0
Im curious how many total circles you saw	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	I got the same answer as nine for one of my squares and then I multiplied that by six because thats how many there were	4.0
Okay so you saw one group of three times three and then you saw that happened six times	Yeah	0.0
For a total of what		3.0
Sutton	I saw that one box had nine and then if you look at all of them I just did nine times six	4.0
Corey go for it	I counted out three by three on the boxes which is nine and then I saw two by two so I multiplied that which is six and then I just moved	4.0
Okay so you saw one group that was three by three and then you saw that happen two by three times	Yes	0.0
Which would be six right	Yes	0.0
How did you see it	I saw nine circles and then I added nine plus nine nine plus nine nine plus nine and then that was 54	4.0
Is that right	Well actually I did nine plus nine and then that was 18 so I did 18 plus 18 plus 18	4.0
That would be 54 right	Yeah	0.0
Oh sorry	You keep showing it	0.0
You guys ready	Yeah	0.0
On your marks get set	Wrong way	0.0
Wrong way	Hey you want to move that	0.0
Did 20 seconds feel about right	Id say 30 but	3.0
Okay Bs you may get started	you got 26	1.0
you got 26	26 like this	1.0
26 like this	Seven times two	4.0
Seven times two	And then one	4.0
And then one	Im trying to figure out what	2.0
Im trying to figure out what	Well yeah	0.0
Well yeah	Thatd be 50	1.0
As it is your turn	six plus six	4.0
six plus six	Put in two	4.0
Put in two		4.0
	Yep	1.0
What did you see	I saw 21	3.0
Okay	I saw six going at the top and then seven going down and I multiplied those two and I got 42 and then since theyre half dots they only count for half a dot I divided that by two and got 21	4.0
Eloise go for it	I didnt see it as six or seven I saw it as six and eight so I just split eight and six in half to make it easier to multiply	4.0
Did you do six times eight and then divide by two	I just divided eight by two and six by two and then multiplied	4.0
Did you do three by four	Yeah	0.0
And you got what		3.0
Yeah	I did five times eight because I  counted fast enough and then I divided that	4.0
I did five times eight because I  counted fast enough and then I divided that	Which I got 21	4.0
40 divided by two would be		3.0
Okay you guys ready to look at it	Mmhmm	0.0
Did anybody think about it that way	No because I didnt have time	0.0
No because I didnt have time	Well yeah kind of	0.0
what do you think	Equal	3.0
Eloise do you agree	Yeah	1.0
Estella whatd you do	It was my first time making cookies	0.0
And	I doubled the cookie powder and I baked cookies	3.0
Did it work	Yeah it did work actually	3.0
Yeah and then youll have twice as many cookies right or I guess they could be bigger too	We got big cookies	0.0
Yeah Willa	A few nights ago we were making soup and we had to grill the  because the soup was like we only got the small noodles for it so  so we doubled the recipe	4.0
Yeah Sutton and then Eloise	I had to double the recipe because I always make the whole bag of pancakes	4.0
And Eloise	I think it was yesterday maybe with some garlic shrimp noodles for myself and it was supposed to make five servings	4.0
I think it was yesterday maybe with some garlic shrimp noodles for myself and it was supposed to make five servings	Cut it in half because I wasnt going to eat five servings of noodles	4.0

Emma how much cheese am I going to need	Two cups	3.0
Brescia how much pasta am I going to need	Six	3.0
I just had to double everything so crew this is still going to be equivalent its still going to taste the same but Im now going to have twice as much	Should we write a sentence out for A	0.0
I want you guys to tell me how much soup how much cheese and how much pasta I need	Should we tell you like out loud	0.0
How much soup am I going to need	Five	3.0
Corey how much cheese am I going to need	One half	3.0
And Sawyer how much pasta am I going to need	A fifth	3.0
A fifth	I mean 15	3.0
Getting ready to make my dish and my phone rings again	Corbin what is it	0.0
Im like Of course you can come	Can I come	0.0
Im like Yes	Im surprised they all have your number	0.0
Im doing five times the original amount so Im going to start at my first column and crew what am I going to multiply by	Five	3.0
Its five times as big and I think Im going to have to borrow some pans because I need five pans to be able to do this	No you can have some of mine	0.0
No you can have some of mine	I have a lot of pans	0.0
Stone how much soup am I going to need		3.0

Yeah tell me how you got five	I timesed one times five	3.0
Yeah and Eloise how much pasta am I going to need		3.0
Okay	Thats a lot of	0.0
Okay so Im about to go to the grocery store and I hear from everybody and theyre like Oh T we have a science test tomorrow that we have to study for	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	We had a math test	0.0
We had a math test	Ill miss it for your casserole	0.0
I have my heart set on tuna noodle casserole	I can come	0.0
And my family is also like We have a science test too	What	0.0
I know my husband has a science test and my daughter has a science test	I sill want to come	0.0
I sill want to come	Ill miss the science test for you	0.0
What should I do to what I already have up here	Divide it by five	3.0
What should I divide by five	The first five	3.0
Sutton how much soup do I need	Two	3.0
How did you get two	Because 10 divided by five is two	4.0
Tanner how much cheese do I need	What we need five	3.0
If I have one but I only need one fifth of that amount what am I going to do	Divide by five	3.0
One divided by five can be written this way one over five	So just one fifth	3.0
One fifth mmhmm  because one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth plus one fifth is one	Would one fifth be 2	3.0
Think about what we did here	Six tenths	3.0
Yeah Brynn	I noticed that if you look at it but that and the amount of cheese are always the same	3.0
I noticed that if you look at it but that and the amount of cheese are always the same	First one one one	3.0
First one one one	Second one is two and two	3.0
Do you remember	Nope	0.0
Its a one to one ratio	Yes thats what it is	3.0
Yes thats what it is	And I forget	0.0
I got to look back at my notes	Three	3.0
Is it three	Yes	0.0
This is the one working for this one	Wait we just left out the tuna	3.0
Yeah no youre going to finish because we did pasta first and youre going to finish it with tuna	I mean with like splitting in half and stuff	3.0
Oh	We just forgot the most important ingredient	3.0
What would we say Estella for every three cups of pasta there is	One cup cheese 10 ounces	3.0
Were only going to compare it to tuna	Oh	0.0
Look on page seven at your recipe	Oh the six ounce can of tuna	3.0
Yeah there is six ounces of tuna	Could you also do a two  of tuna	3.0
No because in our original recipe it calls for three cups of pasta and six ounces of tuna	But didnt you simplify it	3.0
Yeah how would you simplify it	Would you do three cups pasta and two ounces of tuna	3.0
What would I multiply by in order to get that equivalent ratio	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
Tanner what do you think	By three	3.0
Answer right here	Okay	0.0
Emerson do you want to read yours	When you can divide both of the numbers by the same number	3.0
Corey	When you divide it if you can multiply it back to the regular	3.0
You guys say it	Subitizing	0.0
You guys say it	Subitizing	0.0
You guys ready	Yes	0.0
On your marks get set	Okay	0.0
Whos going first	As	0.0
Nylah lets start with you	So I thought it was nine times six because in each of those little boxes theres threebythree and three times three is nine	4.0
Okay	And there was six this way and that way and then I just did nine times six and I thought it was 56	4.0
Try that one more time	Oh it would be 54	3.0
Go for it	Okay so when I saw it I saw that there was three in each and three right there	4.0
Okay so when I saw it I saw that there was three in each and three right there	And I did three times three and three times three in the upper row and the bottom row and added that and I got 18	4.0
And I did three times three and three times three in the upper row and the bottom row and added that and I got 18	And so twos 18	4.0
So you saw three times three once	Yeah	0.0
And then you saw three times three again	Yeah I did	0.0
Yeah I did	And then	0.0
Okay	I saw two of those boxes equaled 18 and if one is nine then three must be 27	4.0
And then what did you do	And then I said well two of them is 18 then three of them would be 27 and so I took the bottom row is 27 and the top row is also going to be 27	4.0
Jude	So I kind of saw something similar except to find the six boxes I thought for some reason that they were like one big box and then I did two and three and then I did two times three equaled six boxes and then I just looked at the squares and counted three times three which is nine and then I just multiplied to that	4.0
So I kind of saw something similar except to find the six boxes I thought for some reason that they were like one big box and then I did two and three and then I did two times three equaled six boxes and then I just looked at the squares and counted three times three which is nine and then I just multiplied to that	And then with that	0.0
And then you did that times You saw three groups by two groups	Yeah	0.0
Yeah Asa	I didnt do it this way but you could add the top of a box with all the tops would which would equal nine and then you could go by the side and basically make it one big square and itd be six times nine	4.0
Would you guys like to do another one	Yes	0.0
Be ready for this one	Is it harder	0.0
No its just different	That was very skeptical	0.0
You guys ready	Yes	0.0
So on your marks get set go	So what I did	0.0
So what I did	I got to count all of them and then there were clumps of a six and then down I counted seven so I did six times seven to get 42 and then I knew to divide that in half to make half circles and then I still didnt get an answer from that	4.0
Go for it	Well I think I counted wrong so I dont think I have the right answer but I do know how to do it	3.0
Yeah tell us your strategy	So what I counted is I counted the left column and the top row and then I multiplied those by each other	3.0
Okay and whatd you get for those two	Well I got 48	3.0
So what two numbers did you multiply	Six and eight	3.0
You got 48	Mmhmm	0.0
I like your strategy to think about it like an array	And then I divided it in half	3.0
Why did you divide it in half	Well because since the things were half of them I decided that instead of making it three times four I would just divide it in half	4.0
So whats 48 divided by two		3.0
Did I hear from Jason last time	No	0.0
Go for it Jason	So what I did is I saw that there was eight in one row	4.0
So what I did is I saw that there was eight in one row	Eight halves	4.0
Eight halves	So then I just counted essentially six rows in total	4.0
So then I just counted essentially six rows in total	I took two of them two of the rows and added them together since they were half of a whole	4.0
I took two of them two of the rows and added them together since they were half of a whole	So counted it up	4.0
So counted it up	Since there were six rows there was three rows in each so I added those	4.0
Since there were six rows there was three rows in each so I added those	That is 48	4.0
That is 48	And then half of it is 24	4.0
And then you saw those two groups three times	Yeah	0.0
So he did six times two because there were six You said there were six in each row or in each column	Eight in each	3.0
Campbell did we hear from you last time	No	0.0
Go for it	All right	0.0
All right	So I got two answers because I wasnt sure what the bottom row was	4.0
So I got two answers because I wasnt sure what the bottom row was	It was either seven or eight	4.0
It was either seven or eight	So I did both of them	4.0
So I did both of them	So I counted the top row was six and the bottom which was seven or eight	4.0
So I counted the top row was six and the bottom which was seven or eight	And then so then I found that half of both of those because  each half was four and have half of each of those and for six is three and for seven is 35 but for eight it was four	4.0
And then so then I found that half of both of those because  each half was four and have half of each of those and for six is three and for seven is 35 but for eight it was four	So then I timesed it together and I got 12	4.0
Yes Jude	So I saw it was seven	3.0
So I saw it was seven	So I got a 21	3.0
So I got a 21	Yeah same	1.0
Yeah same	I got seven	1.0
I got seven	I counted seven	1.0
I counted seven	I could like it could be a	0.0
Like seven	No seven going down	3.0
So seven this going vertically	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then going horizontally I got six so then I did that times six times seven and then I got 42 so I just divided it by two because I knew that they were all in half which equaled 21	4.0
And then going horizontally I got six so then I did that times six times seven and then I got 42 so I just divided it by two because I knew that they were all in half which equaled 21	But also if it was eight in the red maybe 24	4.0
She saw these groups right here and shes like well if I put these together and kind of flip this one around and match them Is that right Jason	Yeah	0.0
Alicia	I did it in an even different way	1.0
I did it in an even different way	So I took the top row which is six and then I put each of those together to put two halves together to make three wholes	4.0
So I took the top row which is six and then I put each of those together to put two halves together to make three wholes	And then I went down the sides	4.0
And then I went down the sides	I was too nervous	0.0
I was too nervous	I think I got seven and then I did three times seven	4.0
So you kind of matched them this way	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You could also divide six by whats it called two to get three rows and then you would use seven and then do seven times two equals 14	4.0
You could also divide six by whats it called two to get three rows and then you would use seven and then do seven times two equals 14	And then plus 14 equals 17	4.0
So that would be three times seven which is 21	Oh not seven not 17 sorry	3.0
I think its page seven in your pink packet	What a coincidence	0.0

Tyson	Its how far youve gone	3.0
Its how far youve gone	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Its just like a	0.0
Clayton	Is it measured in kilometers	3.0
Yes	Feet	3.0
Its not feet	Meters	3.0
Last one	Miles	3.0
This ones in miles and what do you guys suppose the time is	How long they did it for	3.0
What unit are they using to measure time	An hour	3.0
What do you think Thatcher	Minutes	3.0
Titan	Miles per hour	3.0
Im just going to turn to a clean page so you guys can follow along and Im going to start with  Dallas and Im going to start with your great discussion of the two things we are comparing and the two things we are comparing are what crew	Distance and time	3.0
So Gemma what needs to go in the first column of Dallass table	How many minutes it took her to go one mile	3.0
Yeah and how many minutes did it take her to go one mile	Eight minutes	3.0
What should we put there	30 minutes	3.0
How many miles was she able to go in 30 minutes	Three	3.0
Delta do you have a proposal	Id say youd scale both of them down so you get to the unit rate	3.0
Tell me exactly what we should do on Jadas	Divide by three	3.0
Divide by three	Its that same situation	3.0
Okay	Sorry	0.0
Then Delta what are we going to have	Were going to have 10 and one	3.0
How come	Because she only  24 minutes and if she was running faster she	4.0
What on our ratio table will help us support that Dallas is the faster runner	I put  eight minutes to the 10	3.0
Dallas is a faster runner because	Because she takes less time to run the same distance	4.0
Giselle can you read your statement	No	0.0
No	Im not ready yet	0.0
Tyson can you read yours	Dallas is the faster runner because she takes less time to run the same distance	4.0
Go for it	I said that Dallas is the  faster runner because  took her less time to run the exact same distance as Jada	4.0
Same rate	Page 15	0.0
So if someone says same rate to you I want you to think about what that means	Its the same rate	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Partner A on your marks get set	Someone else	0.0
Partner B it is your turn	A unit rate is a rate	3.0
Van what does same rate mean	Me and my partner thought it would be like the same unit rate of	3.0
Delta	I thought it would be equivalent	3.0
Turn over to page 15 please	Is this the last page of the packet	0.0
Hes back and this time	missed you	0.0
Diego paid 47 for three tickets to a concert	Damn	0.0
Gwen what does that mean	It means did the tickets individually cost the same	3.0
Westin what is some important information about Diego that we should pay attention to	How much he paid per ticket	3.0
So how much did he pay		3.0
For how many tickets	Three	3.0
Esther	Im just saying that we could always do 47 times three and that also equals 141	4.0
Hannah what is the important information we should pay attention to for Andre	141 for nine tickets	3.0
Eden what are the two things that we are comparing for Diego	Price	3.0
Mmhmm  and what else	Number of tickets	3.0
Price  or money and tickets and what was the price Eden	For Diego its 47	3.0
For how many tickets	Three	3.0
Once again we are going to  compare money and tickets and Jolene what is our information we need to include there	Andre has the nine tickets and 141	3.0
So what is your proposal to figure out if they have the same rate	When I came up with this I just thought of for Diegos you just multiple 47 and three times three and the tickets nine and the cost is 141	4.0
Tell me why you picked three	Because three times three is nine and three times 47 is 141	4.0
Then you did 47 times three and remind us what you got		3.0
Joyce what does this information mean	It means that  its equivalent to Andres amount of money	3.0
Yeah	Its like theyre the same amount	3.0
So how do we know its going to be the same amount per individual ticket	Because 47 times three is the answer for  47 times three is 141 and then  three times three equals nine which is the exact same thing thats equivalent to Andres rate	4.0
Yeah Delta	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So that was my question	2.0
So that was my question	If you divided Andres ratio table divide by three we could get the same thing as the first column for Diego	4.0
Would you like to check	Sure	0.0
12 divided by three is four so 120 divided by three would be 40 and then crew what is 21 divided by three	Seven	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	Put four	0.0
As Im walking around I am not seeing ratio tables in everyones work today	I erased mine	0.0
I wonder how long its been over there	Oh I see you	0.0
Oh I see you	Wait	0.0
Wait	What	0.0
All right	Why was it looking at the wall	0.0
For real my friends this is one of my favorite drinks	I didnt even know that was a thing	0.0
I  love that some of you are going with your guts	Wait	0.0
Wait	Am I wrong	0.0
Thank you	I think Im wrong	3.0
I think Im wrong	Yeah	1.0
Stand up please	I stood up	0.0
I stood up	Im not standing but Im	0.0
Frances what are the two things we are comparing	Orange juice and	3.0
Orange juice and what else	Soda water	3.0
How much orange juice and how much soda water	Three liters of orange juice and four liters of soda water	3.0
Titan help me fill in the first column here	For Zyon	0.0
Mmhmm	There are four liters of OJ and five liters of soda	3.0
Joyce lets hear it	I think we could find the unit rate of both of them	3.0
Or do you want to do how much orange juice per soda water	Soda water per orange juice	3.0
So you want to get to one orange  juice	Yeah	0.0
So in this first situation what should we divide by	If we want to get for orange juice we should go to one so divide by three	4.0
Yes Delta	I have a question	2.0
Oh sure	Does unit rate matter if the ones on the top or the bottom	3.0
Does unit rate matter if the ones on the top or the bottom	Or does it not matter	3.0
So just read it carefully but in this case we could have done it either way	Cool	0.0
Cool	Thank you	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Crew everybody what are we going to divide by	Four	3.0
Thanks for your help which would be one and then crew what is five divided by four	Fourfifths	3.0
Close	Fivefourths	3.0
Fivefourths because its five divided by four which we can write as one and onefourth	You guys are all wrong	1.0
Thatcher what did you just realize	I realized  that	0.0
I realized  that	So that four over four is one and then plus five over four is one more and then you get onefourth minus the  and that one  equals one fourth	4.0
So crew are these going to taste the same	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
So theyre not going to taste the same	Everybody was wrong	1.0
Everybody was wrong	Everyone was	1.0
Well everybody	Except him	1.0
We know that	Zyon	3.0
Whats up	Well I think that Zyons would be more OJ because one and onethird has more of a chance to get to two because its only three thirds you have to get to instead of four	4.0
Tyson	Wait	0.0
Wait	I forgot	0.0
Frances what do you think	One and onethird is bigger	3.0
Because this is bigger its going to mean more water gets added and if more water gets added is it going to be more orangey or less orangey	Less orangey	3.0
Are you guys ready	Yes	0.0
Denver	One	3.0
So if we count by fours and fives whats the first number theyll land on together	Onefourth	3.0
Giselle		3.0

Okay so like I said I want you to just try try to fill out whatever you can	Since it doesnt show the y intercept can we just put the y intercept wherever we want	3.0
Negative 2x plus zero	Yes	0.0
If Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
But I like the way youre thinking about it because thats exactly the problem with this one is we dont know what the y intercept is from the equation	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Alright then	0.0
I guess I was the lamest joke ever	Honestly I think some of my Mr Guatiers from seventh grade science think thats funny	3.0
How are you doing	Good	0.0
Good	How about you	0.0
Well any weekend plans	Yeah	0.0
troubling muffins perfectly keep young turnips	I already told you about my grandpa who does farming right	0.0
Yeah thats another one of the things	He also grows turnips	0.0
He also grows turnips	Yeah thats also he does good with	0.0
Yeah I guess the way that I interpret this one is that if you have if you pick your turnips early then you need to take maybe like some weak old muffins or something and put them all next to each other in the cupboard	Organization	0.0
You can unmute and say it	They have a three	3.0
And you can just unmute once you notice whats the same about these points	the x axis is always at two	3.0

We have a test today	Right	0.0
Hudson I think you meant to say 05 equals one half	alright	0.0
And Myles and Otto great starts Thomas want to be able to see your workas well	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
Okay	um yeah its still loading	0.0
So whats up Daniellay Just join the paradeck okay	Okay	0.0
Anybody feeling brave and want to explain why this is or is not a function	I can	0.0
What do you think Rylee	I think this is a function because all of the domain numbers each one only has one arrow pointing not two arrows or any more than one	4.0
How does that sound	That sounds good	0.0
Okay now lets see everybodys circleYes	Yay	0.0
Go ahead	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I just saw the opportunity And I took it	0.0
Thats not good Either	Mine is working	0.0
Why did you say this was not a function	I said it wasnt a function	4.0
I said it wasnt a function	Because the graph I noticed on the graph that when theres a line like the graph the land will touch two points at the same time	4.0
Because the graph I noticed on the graph that when theres a line like the graph the land will touch two points at the same time	I said no because theres only one domain and theyre all pointing at five different numbers	4.0
I said no because theres only one domain and theyre all pointing at five different numbers	And we already know that the domains cant have more than one arrow to be a function	4.0
Illtalk to you soon	Thank you bye	0.0

Does that sound okay Cason	Yeah	0.0
What were you gonna say Shae	Yeah its almost	0.0
Almost makes sense	It does have two like things that you grow in there	0.0

Did you say catdog	I dont know I just thought of two three letter words and cat and dog	0.0
I dont know I just thought of two three letter words and cat and dog	I accidentally before he told us we were starting the test	0.0
I accidentally before he told us we were starting the test	away I accidentally already started it	0.0
away I accidentally already started it	So like its running up my time right now	0.0
So like its running up my time right now	But I have like three questions left	0.0
For Which one	The practice test chapter four	0.0
There Is there a time on that time limit	Yes says 49 minutes remaining	0.0
Yes says 49 minutes remaining	There was like an hour	0.0
So Im just gonna take off the time limit	Okay thank you	0.0
I just forgot to take it off	Sorry I started it without further instruction	0.0
Can anybody tell me what the slope is	The slope is negative two	3.0
And once you get practice writing in equations from these sorts of problems	My computers lagging right now and wont let me write	0.0
Okay Mallory can you tell me since were looking at yours whats the y intercept for this problem	zero and 43	3.0
Thanks Stella for sharing that one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I think so	0.0
how did you get those different fonts Then	Its hard to type it So Im just going to say it	0.0
Its hard to type it So Im just going to say it	I highlighted it and then right clicked on it	0.0
I highlighted it and then right clicked on it	And then it says emojis and symbols	0.0
Oh like if you just type something in the chat and then highlight it	Yeah and then highlight it or like highlight one letter then emojis and symbols	0.0
Yeah and then highlight it or like highlight one letter then emojis and symbols	Its also a way to put emojis in	0.0
Its also a way to put emojis in	then then a search bar and just put like the letter B and then picked one	0.0
So is this a function or not	I say its not a function because the numbers in the domain box repeat	4.0
I say its not a function because the numbers in the domain box repeat	And if we think of inauidble whats it called	2.0
the vertical line test	yeah the vertical line test	0.0
So let me go back to this one	It touches two points at one time	3.0
Any questions so far	Mr G I have to go	0.0
We are wrapping up anyways	Do we have any homework	0.0
Okay	All right	0.0
All right	Sounds good	0.0
And can somebody tell me whats if youre stuck on the homework what should you do	Go to advisory	0.0
Whats another thing you could do	Click the Help button	0.0

Sorry	I forgot we had to type in	0.0
I forgot we had to type in	Im sorry	0.0
Okay so Katie What do you think	Well I put the zero and then the five	4.0
Well I put the zero and then the five	And then like obviously its going to be by ones on the X	4.0
And then like obviously its going to be by ones on the X	And I put the 10 was zero	4.0
And I put the 10 was zero	And then the zero and the five	4.0
And then the zero and the five	And then well I cant go by ones because its not a lot of room	4.0
And then well I cant go by ones because its not a lot of room	So then I was thinking why not twos	4.0
A Go ahead Daphne when you write	Sorry do you want me to	0.0
Sorry do you want me to	Oh y equals 10 over 5x plus 10	3.0
Okay	Oh two over one	3.0
But remember its negative because the lines going down	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
What was the first thing we did	Marked like an x one and a y one	3.0
I dont know if anyone is looking at my video on here but I was probably super scared when that happened	I saw it	0.0
How are you doing	Im good	0.0
Im good	How are you doing	0.0
Well thanks for asking you feeling better today	Yeah	0.0
So like look through the notes and stuff but also make sure you get that homework assignment turned in Okay	Okay	0.0
We are missing Kyra and Evan today	Um can I just go to the bathroom really fast	0.0
How are you doing Kyra	Good	0.0
Good	How about you	0.0
Fried egg	Awesome	0.0
Awesome	I could do a drum roll	0.0
I dont think we did	Yeah I dont think we did	0.0
What are the two things we need in our equation	Is it the slope and the y intercept	3.0
What did I label underneath these coordinates	the x and the y	3.0
So hopefully yours will start working as well	Is it half of nine	3.0
Close What are these both divisible by	three	3.0
And you put them in the equation and then you subtract and divide	If its already a negative number do you have to switch the symbol from minus to plus or just keep it as minus	2.0
What is negative three minus six	negative nine	3.0
So does that answer your question	No	0.0
No	My second question right	0.0
My second question right	Or or the question was about the second row because	2.0
Oh I see	x one is a negative number	3.0
x one is a negative number	I dont know if I should be changing that	2.0
That makes sense Rylee	Yeah that helps	0.0
Any questions on the graphic organizer	Um yeah do we have like like are all the equations and everything that we need already in our notes	0.0
Yes they should be	Like all the definitions	0.0
So Jeremiah can you tell me what would be your first step to solve this equation	plus seven from the 6x	3.0
And Andrea what would be your next step here	Sorry one second	0.0
thats all right	You would like combine the like terms with the 6x and 5x	3.0
All right Chris what do you think we need to do next to complete this problem	For that like Are you trying to	0.0
So what do I need to do to find those distances	You you take those equations and you multiply eight times the amount of xs there are	3.0
Okay thanks Chris	Yeah	0.0
Okay so any without doing any adding or subtracting or multiplying can you tell me what is qR	Would it be	0.0
What do we know about these two segments	Theyre equal So its 41	4.0
Okay and Fernando can you tell me what would PR be then if we know each parts 41	82	3.0
U is the midpoint of TV	Mister G could you explain that again like how you got the segment from the equation	2.0
Does that help Patrick	Yeah I get it	0.0
How would we solve a problem that looks like this	Maybe add the 12	3.0
We want to set it equal to zero Right	Right	0.0
So could we also take away 8x at the same time	Right	0.0
And Ethan can you give me some factors of 12	Can you do 12 and one	3.0
Ethan	Im not sure	2.0
Can you think of another two factors of 12	2 and 6	3.0
What do you think	Im not sure	2.0
Im going to highlight a couple things for you Diane and then you can tell me what would you do with these two parts that Im highlighting	Oh add them	3.0
Okay now Patrick what do you think Um what do you think we need to do next if we want to set it equal to zero	Um not sure	2.0
Oh how would we get rid of this part	Oh minus 24	3.0
Other Patrick Patrick Garcia Lopez what are some factors of negative 28	14 and 2	3.0
And can we combine those two make three	No	0.0
Okay so whats another factor pair for negative 28	I dont know	2.0
Four times whats gonna get us 28	Four times five	3.0
Sorry	I have a question	0.0
Yeah go ahead Sienna	Every time that theres two answers is do they always both work	2.0
Every time that theres two answers is do they always both work	Or do you have to check both of them	2.0
Okay any questions so far About how I checked my work there	Um I have a question	0.0
Whats up	If we plug in negative seven What would that thats not	2.0
Tristan	BC hold on I gotta go back to the example	0.0
BC hold on I gotta go back to the example	BC is Im sorry I was I finished the example A while back and I was going ahead what did I miss	2.0
So my question was a little bit tricky I think because of the way I said it but if AB is already built then what is this gonna be a positive and negative number over here	Negative 18	3.0
x equals negative seven is not an answer	Yeah that makes sense	0.0
Camila Can you give me your answer to number one three collinear points	I said kcf	3.0
Eliza Do you have another set of three collinear points	bch	3.0
and co planar means same plane	I said Ahce	3.0
Can you pick a different one to replace it	K sorry	3.0
Can you just replace a with a different one	Uh K	3.0
Okay so say those points again	K wait hold on	3.0
K wait hold on	KHCE	3.0
Okay	BCH	3.0
BCH	would that be it	3.0
Say it agian for m Amara	Would bch be it then	3.0
and Lila can you give me a different four points Thatd be coplanar	Yeah so b c h e	3.0
Okay um Brad can you give me two lines please	Sorry B and H and F and k	3.0
And what was your second one Brad	f and K	3.0
If you put that one down if anyone put that one down okay and then um Lila how about one line that is not drawn	I said CE	3.0
How about	inauidble HE	3.0
Did you say be	He	3.0
Alright Lila just make sure you mute yourself please	Sorry	0.0
And Lila Lila you have a question	Oh no sorry	0.0
Whats the same about both of these	um the letters in the angle	3.0
the letters in the angle and whats like exactly the same in the same exact spot in both of them	the end points in the middle	3.0
All right any question on this little segment of notes so far	Why can you call it angle one	2.0
The answer your question Lila	Yeah	0.0
Whats one way that you name this angle	Um did we go over that in like or cuz I was looking at the definitions and stuff in the pictures	0.0
Um did we go over that in like or cuz I was looking at the definitions and stuff in the pictures	Is that what youre talking about like naming them	0.0
Im talking about like how we named this angle like a x q or angle qx a	Oh okay so would this one just be S y z	3.0
Yep	Okay	0.0
Whats another way that you could name this	Oh sorry	0.0
Oh sorry	Um z y x	3.0
And then Angelina whats another way that you could name this angle	shp	3.0
Okay any questions on any of these four Before I talk about one other one	Yeah Im wondering if you ever measure an angle more than 180 degrees	3.0
starts with an R Anyone Remember that	Right Angle	3.0
Right Angle	reverse angle	1.0
in green	5x plus 10 Plus Oh well I guess thats part of 180 degrees	3.0
What are these add up to here	180	3.0
Whats the first whats the first thing that would be easy to figure out X Y or Z	Y	3.0
Chris	subtract 76	3.0
Someone online Can you unmute and tell me What would be the first thing that you notice in this diagram	The 47	3.0
Christian what about the 47	Also Its a theres a right angle	3.0
And so like Christian what would be your The first thing that you would do to solve this problem	Would it be a 90 minus 47	3.0
So 47 plus y is going to equal 90 do you agree with that Christian	Oh yes	0.0
Okay Evan	That 47 is vertical to inaudible	3.0
Okay so what we do now	47 minus x equals 180	4.0
Say it again	2x equals 76	3.0
Thats our vertical angles	You could also do Y plus 76 equals inauidble	3.0
Like do we need to do substitution or elimination	Yeah	0.0
whats one equation we could write from this from this diagram	X plus Y equals Y minus x equals 180	3.0
Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write	2x plus y plus x equals 180 2x plus	3.0
Gavin	Crosstalk	0.0
Go ahead Gavin	2X equals Y minus x	3.0
Whats y	90	3.0
All right what do we think is is this equation or this equation gonna be easier to use	The second one	3.0
And what do I need to do now to solve	inaudible 3x minus 90	3.0
What do I need to do	inaudible	0.0
You have a question	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Um so you always have to have two equations	3.0
Um so you always have to have two equations	does it matter which one you use And like is there certain way you have to choose them	3.0
someone online Whats the whats the simplest equation that we can write from this with the fewest amount of letters and numbers	Would it be 2x equals 4y	3.0
Greg	3x plus y Plus 9 plus 4y inaudible	3.0
And someone gave me one equation for the elimination That equals 180	3x is to y plus 3y minus x equals 180	3.0
Okay someone online Whats another equation that we could write that adds up to 180	We could do	0.0
We could do	go ahead Rob	0.0
go ahead Rob	or or you could do three y minus x plus y minus x equals 180	3.0
So three y minus x plus y minus x does is that what you said Rob	Yeah	0.0
I guess Im thinking of like which of these because we simplify them Right	Oh Yeah	0.0
Its the dreaded last step	Check it	3.0
What kind of angles to these make	Alternate interior	3.0
could be anybody What kind of angles are these	corresponding	3.0
And Patrick what kind of or what do we know about corresponding angles	That theyre parallel	3.0
Not parallel	Oh um	0.0
What like how can we compare these	Um	0.0
are they the same	Yeah	0.0
What kind of angles are these	Same side interior	3.0
And are same side interior anglesThe same	No	0.0
Starts with an S	supplementary	3.0
What do we do last to finish off this problem	Check it	3.0
What is the other angle has to be 20 with the 103	77	3.0
Okay what are those two highlighted parts Ivan	corresponding	3.0
So corresponding and Ivan what uh what do we know about corresponding angles	Theyre congruent	3.0
Should we take away x or take away 3x	Take away x	3.0
Lizzie whats up	Um so for that angle it looks like a 90 degree angle	3.0
Um so for that angle it looks like a 90 degree angle	But is that not the case	3.0
But is that not the case	Because like the equation that makes sense but it looks like a 90 degree angle	3.0
Does that make sense Lizzie	Yeah thank you	0.0
What do we know about those	Equlity	3.0
Not congruent	They equal 180	3.0
Okay anybody have a suggestion on this one	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Ian	Well the corresponding angles For y minus 40 is the angle that would add together with y to make 180	4.0
Well the corresponding angles For y minus 40 is the angle that would add together with y to make 180	So when that mean that y minus 40 plus y would be 180	4.0
when they combine like this	linear pair	3.0
I just have a question	Like another way you could solve this problem	2.0
Yeah go ahead	If youre not the angle vertical to y Thats corresponding to x plus 20	4.0
If youre not the angle vertical to y Thats corresponding to x plus 20	So that would be 95	4.0
So that would be 95	Could you do 95 equals y	4.0
Lets	Im not sure if thats right But	0.0
So you said this angle	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Would that angle be the same as The corresponding angle 95	3.0
I think youre muted right now	Oh yes	0.0
So like	yeah thank you	0.0
so yes yeah	wait does it mean like that actually shows whether inauidble or not	0.0
That makes sense Ian	Yeah	0.0
Someone in here What is congruent	equal	3.0
Which letter matches up with B and the other one	CA	3.0
CA	C	1.0
Someone online Can you give me the next pair of sides that are equal	IG and AT	3.0
IG and AT Yes	can I restate that	0.0
Yes go ahead Alexander	segment I G is congruent to segment AT	3.0
Okay so someone in here was our third one	BG CT	3.0
Okay angle B is congruent to which angle	C	3.0
We have to have three pairs	Angle I is congruent to angle A	3.0
Is that Heiko	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	angle D	3.0
What does B matchup with	F	3.0
You have a question Sean	inauidble triangle inauidble order obviously	0.0
inauidble triangle inauidble order obviously	But could it also be like ABC is congruent to the DEF	3.0
BC	so ACB And DEF	3.0
Okay so a matches up which letter	E	3.0
B matches up with what	D	3.0
so those match up and then lastly	C and F	3.0
Okay if you move that side that angle	You get the same triangle	3.0
Ian	Wait How do we do that without the angle	2.0
So	Oh no wait	0.0
because	inauidble	0.0
So this side right here ad five inch side does that have a side that it matches up with on the other one	Yes	0.0
third side 123123 Are these the same triangles	Yes	0.0
A matches up with what	E	3.0
Which one	E	3.0
Okay so A matches up E B matches up with	F	3.0
from this picture	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	no	1.0
Ian	well yeah because we have the vertical angle	4.0
Okay so now Do we have side angle side for both	Uh huh	0.0
What was that Sean	HIG	3.0
What does I match up with	I	3.0
Its like you have two lines and we put the arrow like that	Yeah	0.0
Is this side the same for both of them	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
And same three sides whats our reason	by side side side	3.0
But what like just all three	LOM	0.0
O matches up with what	N M	3.0
So triangle l O M is N O	Wait	0.0
Wait	No inaudibe	0.0
Yes Ian	inauidble Because its not SAS but  rather SSA or ASS	4.0
Let me think about that for a quick second	I mean you can make it I guess you can make trianlges on that one	3.0
I mean you can make it I guess you can make trianlges on that one	I dont know	2.0
Thats the same triangle right	Yeah	0.0
Okay I need a better example than that	So it works	3.0
What do we know about these angles here	Theyre verticle	3.0
Thank you	Mr G I have a problem loading the whiteboard	0.0
Say that again Christopher	I have a problem loading the whiteboard	0.0
And dont dont worry about the whiteboard for today	Alrighty	0.0
Alrighty	Thank you Mr g	0.0
what would you divided by	Five	3.0
substitute or eliminate	Substitute	3.0
Okay and then what	Minue nine	3.0
Okay if W equals one whats V	Then minus nine	3.0
Then minus nine	Two	3.0
Or at least like whats the first step for the angles here	What each triangle like add up to 180	3.0
What each triangle like add up to 180	Like each individual triangle	3.0
Because I think this is the only one that we know two angles in right	Yeah	0.0
How about z	inaudible 145 inauidble	3.0
about the sides	Its like a square and all sides are equal	3.0
What What do we know about the angles in a parallelogram	Opposite angles inauidble	3.0
Is that true for here	Yes	0.0
How about this one are opposite angles congruent	Yes	0.0
In this picture are all the angles the same	No	0.0
Are opposite angles congruent	Yes	0.0
What else do we know for square	They all equal 90 degrees	3.0
So what do we have on the diagonals in a parallelogram	They bisect eachother	3.0
How do these diagonals cross each other	90 degree angle	3.0
Does anybody know what that upside down t means	Starts with a P	0.0
anybody online knows the opposite of parallel is	Perpendicular	3.0
Perpendicular	Perpendicular	1.0
WHat Would this one be		3.0
So someone in here What do we think for this first one	parallelogram	3.0
And Austin what do you think for the second one over here	For the second one I went with rectangle	3.0
Okay great someone in here What do we think for the third one	Rhombus	3.0
Maggie what do you think for this fourth one	A square	3.0
How do you know that Diego	Shape	3.0
could be anybody online for this one	None	3.0
It wasnt in the list	Kite	3.0
Chris what do you think	Square	3.0
Anybody have a guess on this one someone online	Its a rhombus	3.0
Okay what else do we know about a rhombus	That the diaginals bisect the angles	3.0
So what does that make this angle up here	58 degrees	3.0
What does that make 3		3.0
What does that make 2		3.0
180 minus 148 does 32 sound right	Yeah	0.0
Anybody have what what can we start off with Josh	The one that verticle Pt inauidble	3.0
diagonals in every parallelogram	Theyre diagnal	3.0
Even if theyre not even if theyre not the same	They bisect each other	3.0
for that one was nad		3.0
homestretch last one		3.0
How come	Because its theyre the same triangle	4.0
What was that	Verticle	3.0
Close	Theyre opposite inauidble	0.0
Wait did I draw that wrong	No you drew it Right	0.0
No you drew it Right	I know what youre talking about	0.0
I know what youre talking about	I can see it	0.0
I can see it	I just dont know	0.0
I think theyre alternate interiors like this	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah that makes more sense right	Yes	0.0
Anybody remember	Origin	3.0
What coordinate is the same	That Xvalue is always zero	3.0
Close	I mean the Yvalue	3.0
Ill just put some points here	They all have an Xvalue of zero	3.0
Someone in here	All congruent sides	3.0
Is it going to fit on this graph for number six	Yes	0.0
Okay what other side is length B	S T	3.0
Whats the point we dont need to do anything for	Where they intersect	3.0
For the what	Where the lines intersect	3.0
What did we decide every point on the Y axis has	An Xvalue of zero	3.0
Say again	One one	3.0
What was the distance from here to here	H	3.0
All right whats the easiest point to label on example two	J	3.0
Whats probably the next easiest point to label here	K	3.0
Okay whats our next easiest point	K	3.0
Say it again Cardo	Zero Y	3.0
Is that what youre saying	Yeah	0.0
What kind of shape is example three	Its an isosceles triangle	3.0
Isosceles	Or I mean a	0.0
It starts with a T	Trapezoid	3.0
Is it the same height as point B	Yes	0.0
Is it the same X	No	0.0
No	Its negative X for five	3.0
Margaret	Yeah	0.0
Question	No	0.0
Marcus I actually need you to take part two	Is it okay if I	0.0
I dont think the key is posted yet	Okay	0.0
Yeah	Oh all right then	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Were you able to do all five River	Yes	0.0
This is across	Some of these are hard	0.0
All of those are over one up two or something like that for each one	How could you see that	2.0
Anybody in here have the isosceles triangle one	point	0.0
Which point	Its the two on the farleft side	3.0
This one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then the one across	3.0
This one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then go over a lot	3.0
And then go over a lot	And go around this way	3.0
Trapezoid anybody see the trapezoid in here	I think so	0.0
What do you think Emily	The very top one	3.0
The very top one	Its actually just an Lshape with more of a side right	3.0
Or one of the opposite sides one set of opposite sides are parallel	I can make it happen	0.0
I can make it happen	So there to the far left dot	3.0
I dont think its that one	Okay	0.0
Are there any other dots that are vertical	Yes	0.0
Which ones	The farright ones	3.0
The far right so these two lines are parallel right	Yeah	0.0
Does that make sense	These are so hard	0.0
Ruben what do you think	Top right	3.0
Top right	Move onto the left two on the right and then draw it up	3.0
Emily	The second dot down on the left	3.0
The second dot down on the left	And then the farright dot	3.0
And then the farright dot	And then the dot inbetween the right and the left	3.0
Its a challenge to explain which dots on pictures like this right	Yeah	0.0
This one took me a while to see earlier	Top middle	3.0
Its a diagonal square right	Right	0.0
Have these tortured anybody	Yes	0.0
Shane	Its the point between those two dots and it splits it evenly	3.0
Anybody in here neShane more time to write down these two parts	I do	0.0
If youre done writing down these parts you can go ahead and graph the four points for example one making a parallelogram	Im good now	0.0
Emily	The opposite sides are parallel	3.0
Good luck Finley	Thank you	0.0
I think so	You could Y2 trade the exponent for the Y2 on this	3.0
You dont really have to for midpoint but you can because it doesnt matter what order you add them up in	It doesnt	0.0
Emily	Can you also just add them and divide by two	3.0
Just sometimes its way faster like for zero and two if you think of it as a zero its like why not do that right	Right	0.0
Whats the exact middle of zero and one	One half	3.0
So whats one of the main things we know about a rhombus	All sides are congruent	3.0
What do you notice about the Y values	Theres only going to be two	3.0
Just write zero	How did you write it	2.0
Positive six	Shouldnt that be minus	3.0
Its flat	Isnt it undefinShane	3.0
When you have two perpendicular lines whats the product of their slopes	Negative one	3.0
Whats right in the middle	Zero	3.0
The average of one and one	One	3.0
Does that sound good everybody	Yes	0.0
Emily	They are parallel lines	3.0
Now what some people did as a as a answer is if two boxes is six centimeters how many centimeters is one box	Three	3.0
Whats the last angle		3.0
Did these triangles have the same angles Ian	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	The 90s right	3.0
And whats 180 minus 141		3.0
DOes That number look familiar	Yeah	0.0
What would be this last angle here		3.0
Well can we simplify the first one to	43rds	3.0
What did you divide by	By five	3.0
Heres another way Think about it whats 10 divided by five	two	3.0
Whats one of the most useful types of angles in these problems	Right angle	3.0
Starts with a V	vertical angle	3.0
So Does everyone agree this is the same as this	Yeah	0.0
Out of these three Which one do we have	Angle angle	3.0
Which which two sides are the same or the easiest to compare		3.0
is eight twice as big as six	No	0.0
Ryan wat do you think	Isoceles	3.0
What kind of angles Are we going to use the number four	Sides	3.0
Sides	Are we using angles	0.0
We need to we need an angle right	So vertical	3.0
What are they both	One half	3.0
What is it		3.0
Okay C Okay so what is What is this entire side from A to C		3.0
Ryan What else do you think is the same aout these	The angle	3.0
And I think I need to publish it in here and then	C	0.0
How would you go from R to R prime prime	Right one down four	3.0
Whats the equation for the Y axis	Its undefined	3.0
Is it X equals or Y equals	Y equals	3.0
Y equals	No X equals zero	3.0
How many boxes is it way from the blue line	One	3.0
Whats that	I think its Y equals zero	3.0
Both coordinates for L	One comma two	3.0
How about G	Three comma four	3.0
What stays the same on all the points	Y	3.0
Are they related	No theyre just negative	3.0
But you change all the Xs to be the opposite	Can I go to the bathroom	0.0
And whats I prime	Negative five one	3.0
Did the X value stay the same or change	Same	3.0
What are the coordinates for W	Negative two three	3.0
What are the points for W prime	Two and negative three	3.0
Did the Xs stay the same or change	Changed	3.0
Did the Xs stay the same or change	Stayed the same	3.0
Did the Ys stay the same or change	Changed	3.0
Were going to take the red shape  you with me	Yeah	0.0
So where far did I slide it	Seven	3.0
What does it mean to go left eight	Negative eight comma zero	3.0
I know its a lot of graphing	Can I use the restroom please	0.0
When  gets back	Okay	0.0
If X is negative two whats Y	Negative two	3.0
Whats the slope of that line	One	3.0
Whats the Y intercept	Zero	3.0
What are the coordinates of S prime	Five comma zero	3.0
Whats H prime	Four negative two	3.0
If Y equals X looks like this what do you X equals negative X is	The opposite	3.0
For this new point right here what are my coordinates	Zero negative five	3.0
Whats happening	Flip flop and one goes negative	3.0
Whats the new point	Two negative four	3.0
Whats happening between these two points	Flip flop them and count each plot	3.0
Say it again	They switched their value	3.0
The sign	Yeah	0.0
Am I off a little bit	One	3.0
X what	Negative one	0.0
Did I just take the first shape and slide it to the other one	No	0.0
From the first to the other one did I reflect it exactly	You rotated it	3.0
Whats the connection between M here and M up here	The same but negatives	3.0
Yeah	Can I use the restroom	0.0
How are we sliding it exactly	Right three down five	3.0
Anna	Can I go  to the bathroom	0.0
Do we know the base of the triangle in part B	Yes	0.0
How can we find the height	Pythagorean theorem	3.0
Is there a faster way than Pythagorean theorem	Three Four Five	3.0
Where should I  for the hypotenuse	Dont you go to  the smallest one and divide	3.0
What strategy do I need to use to find that last side	Pythagorean theorem	3.0
What is it		3.0
Do we know the base	We do not	3.0
What is it	Opposite	3.0
Whats the seven	Adjacent	3.0
If we multiply those sides by seven then I need a calculator person to plug in seven tangent of 62	1880	3.0
What was it	1880 x 7	3.0
Times seven	Oh 1316	3.0
And Ill need help from another person with a calculator	It will be 461	3.0
Do I know the base of this triangle	Yeah	0.0
Do I know the height of this triangle	No	0.0
So lets think about trigonometry Ana	Why is the base 10	2.0
So lets take a look at this angle 38 and compared to the 38 whats the H	Opposite	3.0
Sine of 38 equals H over 10 10 sine of 38 equals H	H equals 616	3.0
From this step Becca	Yeah	0.0
Like one 12 is 05	Oh wait hold on	0.0
Oh wait hold on	I think I mightve	0.0
That could be true as well	Its	0.0
Then thats not so bad	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I got 51	3.0
I got 51	I got the first two	3.0
So 05 x 19 x 616	Youre drinking alcohol	0.0
What was that AJ	The opposite angle is 120	3.0
The opposite angle is 120	And the other two are 60	3.0
Whats this one going to be		3.0
We want to find X and we want to find H	Cant you just divide by two	3.0
For which one	To get the short leg	3.0
If X is four	Four square root of three	3.0
4 x a squared is	Root three	3.0
What Id do wrong in this problem	Oh wasnt it a parallelogram	3.0
Oh wasnt it a parallelogram	So you dont have to think about half B and find the B H	3.0
Sorry about that	So then the area would be 44 root 3	3.0
You have it way back on page one	12 x the height x base 1   base 2	3.0
Do I know the height of his trapezoid	No	0.0
Do I know base 1 and base 2	Yes	0.0
Do we know any of those sides of that triangle	No	0.0
One of the sides of that right triangle	The base of the right triangle would be 14 minus 13 divided by tangent 7	4.0
The H is what compared to 57	Opposite	3.0
And whats the seven	Adjacent	3.0
I know adjacent	Tangent	3.0
Anybody else get that too	I got 768	3.0
Exactly	Yeah	0.0
Did you do 108 instead of 1078	Yeah	0.0
Sophie what did you say 215 point	Six	3.0
Point six	Yes	0.0
What do we need to do first here	Five squared	3.0
So four PI times  25  now	Four times 25	3.0
Just how many of these squares	How like	0.0
Meters what	Meters  squared	3.0
What are we trying to find with this problem	Radius	3.0
Whats the easiest thing that we can get rid of to get closer to R	Divide both sides by four Pi	3.0
What operation do we need to do to get R by itself	When you square root it	3.0
So whats the square to 49	Seven	3.0
Whats the square root of four	Two	3.0
How would you check it	Well getting into  the quarter Pi R squared	3.0
Well getting into  the quarter Pi R squared	Saw that equals 49	3.0
Thats the nice thing about working backwards is you can make sure you get the right answer	I didnt get that	0.0
I didnt get that	Couldnt it be R equals  or 4 Pi	3.0
Thats what youre saying right	Yeah	0.0
Square miles like a one mile in one direction one mile in the other direction square	Probably  a 100000 square miles	3.0
Anybody have another guess	Yeah	0.0
So if you remember	500000	3.0
How many	500000	3.0
What did I just draw in there	Its funny	0.0
Its not the	Equator	3.0
Equator	Thats the circumcise	1.0
The circus the Circumference	The great circle	3.0
Anybody remember what the formula for circumference is	Two Pi R	3.0
Pi times diameter	So	0.0
How do I solve for R here	Divide by two	3.0
Divided by two what	Pi	3.0
So lets talk	exactly	0.0
Whatd you say	I said 50 million	3.0
Lets see	I was closed for right  here	3.0
I was closed for right  here	Thats not minus the Pi	3.0
Okay	And I was supposed to	0.0
Final answer One nine Lets see here	You have to round it	3.0
Yeah 197359 thousand Did you round up Sassaby	Yeah	0.0
I think its like two thirds right	70	3.0
30	Thats going to increase	3.0
So	but not	0.0
So just something to think about	So also the ocean number is rising as of today	0.0
The other way you can think of it is four Pi R cubed divided by three	Is it the same formula	3.0
Four  thirds Pi times Whats the radius in this one	Six	0.0
What do we need to multiply here by the way to we get our final answer	The multiple of thirds and then Pi	3.0
What is it		3.0
So 288  Pi and what are my units here	Liters cubed	3.0
Volume of surface area	Volume	0.0
What are we trying to solve for it	Surface area	3.0
Before that	Im ready	0.0
Well want to divide both sides	Divide by four Pi	3.0
Just like this	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Which I do first	30 squared	3.0
Yep	Isnt  it Oh nevermind	0.0
What are my units	Meters	3.0
What that means is if theres a circle in the problem what should you have in your answer	Pi	3.0
Less than greater than or equal to	Thank you	0.0
This is confusing isnt it	Yeah	0.0
Okay so Why did you say less than	Because 34 is closer to the whole than 912	4.0
Landon	Because 34s is already equal to 34	4.0
Because 34s is already equal to 34	And then we multiply it by three	4.0
And then we multiply it by three	That doesnt mean it can be greater but not of the top of our heads but it probably is a little greater because its multiplying it	4.0
Yes	Youre finding	0.0
So its going to be three times greater right	Yeah	0.0
Carson do you remember	Because its multiplying by one which anything times one is just the original number	4.0
Cooper	So what I did was	0.0
So what I did was	So if you look at 34 of  and a half is bigger than 14 so youre adding fourths	4.0
So if you look at 34 of  and a half is bigger than 14 so youre adding fourths	So if you had	0.0
Were adding	Or youre multiplying by a half so basically youre multiplying it by 24	4.0
Or youre multiplying by a half so basically youre multiplying it by 24	So that would be bigger than 34 is staying how it is	4.0
So that would be bigger than 34 is staying how it is	It just stayed 34 while the others are multiplied by  fraction	4.0
Do you agree with that Alec	Yes	1.0
Yes	I put no	1.0
Okay	34 and 12 equals 38	4.0
Mmhmm	And the other number which is 34 which equals  whole probably make it bigger greater	3.0
Landon did you have something different	Oh no that was pretty much it	0.0
Remember that	Mmhmm	0.0
This one	Yeah	0.0
This is bigger	Yeah	0.0
Because	I think that because when we multiply by one its the same number	4.0
I think that because when we multiply by one its the same number	And its a fraction its less than one	4.0
And its a fraction its less than one	So its going to be less than one  itself	4.0
Tom	I said 34 is bigger because the 78 isnt a one yet like the after it	4.0
I said 34 is bigger because the 78 isnt a one yet like the after it	So it would have to be less	4.0
And you checked your answer by	I multiplied 4 times 8 is 32	4.0
I multiplied 4 times 8 is 32	And then 3 times 7 is 21	4.0
And then 3 times 7 is 21	So I got 21 out of 32	4.0
This side or this side	The left side	3.0
So why is that bigger	Well its  be the same because	3.0
Yep	It changes	3.0
Tom tell us your convincing argument	I think its equal because 33 is basically one whole so you can just change that 33 to one whole	4.0
I think its equal because 33 is basically one whole so you can just change that 33 to one whole	And then 34 times 1 is the same answer as 34 so theyd be equal	4.0
Are you guys convinced now	Yep	1.0
Yep	Mmhmm	1.0
Wait you just told me you werent convinced by	Oh	0.0
Are you trying to convince somebody on your team	I had the same answer as Tom	1.0
Oh equal yeah	Im trying to convince them	1.0
Alec	Im technically just going to say the same thing	1.0
So we heard what Tom said very clearly	and then  but he said 34 times 1 it would be	4.0
and then  but he said 34 times 1 it would be	34 times 33 and then you have 912 is 34 times	4.0
34 times 33 and then you have 912 is 34 times	It was on the board	0.0
It was on the board	And then that is equal to it because even 4 times 3 equals the 12 in the denominator	4.0
And then that is equal to it because even 4 times 3 equals the 12 in the denominator	And then you get 3 times 3 equals 9 for the numerator	4.0
Everybody	Two	3.0
Whats 5 times 1	Five	3.0
Whats 20 times 1		3.0
Okay so whats 34 times 1	34	3.0
Okay are we good	Yeah	0.0
Try to come up with some different situations	There is a room that is eight square feet one way and seven square feet in the other way	3.0
There is a room that is eight square feet one way and seven square feet in the other way	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And you would do 7 times 8 equals 56	4.0
And you would do 7 times 8 equals 56	So theres a room in the house that  the area is 56	4.0
So theres a room in the house that  the area is 56	How would you figure out that is 56 feet	2.0
How would you figure out that is 56 feet	Id count by seven	1.0
Id count by seven	Yes	1.0
Yes	Because its the area of the room not the perimeter of the room	4.0
Because its the area of the room not the perimeter of the room	Do you want to say	0.0
So whats the situation	Theres a room filled with  Did you say tires	3.0
A room with tires in it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	How many	2.0
How many	How much tires can you fit in there	2.0
How much tires can you fit in there	Tiles	1.0
I was hearing tires	I was like Tires	0.0
Theyre talking school right now	Ah	0.0
Oh nice	Tires I was like No way	0.0
Uhoh I broke it I think	Oh no	0.0
Oh no	Okay	0.0
Okay	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	right	0.0
Okay Alec give us your example	There are seven boxes of basketballs	3.0
There are seven boxes of basketballs	Each one has eight basketballs in them	3.0
Each one has eight basketballs in them	How many balls are there	3.0
Seven boxes of basketballs eight in each box	I feel like its kind of area	3.0
Area	Because its thinking of boxes	4.0
Okay so maybe if you What do you think Cooper	I actually think its volume because its a 3D object and its a box	4.0
Hmm interesting	Itd be equal groups	3.0
Logan what was your problem or your	I bought seven	3.0
I bought seven	Hang on	0.0
Hang on	I want to fix my	0.0
Youre going to fix yours	Yeah	0.0
Thats okay	I wrote mine	0.0
Cooper	Okay	0.0
Okay	Seven bags of nuts fit eight nuts in each bag	3.0
Seven bags of nuts fit eight nuts in each bag	If they have 56 nuts how many more bags will they need	3.0
Isaac	I think it might be a division problem	3.0
Okay	I think it might be a division problem	3.0
An equal group	A division problem	3.0
So can we turn most division problems into a multiplication problem	Yes	0.0
Why can we do that	Because they are technically opposite of multiplication	4.0
Okay Carson what was your area problem	area problem was youre in a room thats eight feet for the length and seven feet for the width	3.0
area problem was youre in a room thats eight feet for the length and seven feet for the width	You are putting down tiles	3.0
You are putting down tiles	How many tiles do you need	3.0
How many tiles do you need	And each tiles a foot	3.0
Okay did that work	Yes	0.0
Logan do you have yours	I bought seven packs of apples and eight packs of grapes	4.0
I bought seven packs of apples and eight packs of grapes	Seven times eight equals 56	4.0
Seven times eight equals 56	So it would be 56	4.0
I think it probably would be	Yeah equal groups	3.0
Landon	I have one that is the second one	0.0
Oh awesome	So the room is eight feet in length and seven feet in width	4.0
So the room is eight feet in length and seven feet in width	How big is the room inches	4.0
How big is the room inches	And  180 inches	4.0
Thats definitely a conversion	Mine is some people are making two sets of rugs	3.0
Mine is some people are making two sets of rugs	The length of each rug needs to be seven yards long and eight yards long	3.0
What is that	Area	3.0
So area is length times width and volume would be length times width times	Height	3.0
The comparisons are Oh so if Toms little brother is seven years old	I dont have a little brother	0.0
And dont say Really old	He was really old	0.0
Okay so you could compare	Yeah hes really old	0.0
Yeah hes really old	Hes a senior	0.0
My dog is half as tall as I am	Hes huge	0.0
So youre learning intention today Eric will you read it for us	fraction multiplication numbers  with numeral context	0.0
Were you three working together	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Yeah	0.0
You guys get this one	Recording	0.0
You guys get this one	Oh we could do conversions	0.0
Oh we could do conversions	Because one of them could be	0.0
Have you got a problem	Yes so were going to	0.0
Yes so were going to	Timmy had six slices of a pizza	3.0
Timmy had six slices of a pizza	He ate half the pizza	3.0
He ate half the pizza	How much did Timmy have left	3.0
Does that work	Yeah	0.0
You guys did fine	Lets just multiply for the answer	3.0
Are you guys now	No way	0.0
No way	No I dont think at all	0.0
You dont think	Your bangs are  with your mask on	0.0
You guys done	No were still figuring	0.0
would that help you think of it better	thats what Im trying to do is change the denominator into a 6	3.0
Why	Because would be an even number so then it would be easier for us to find	4.0
Because would be an even number so then it would be easier for us to find	Figure out	1.0
Okay	Oh wait	0.0
Oh wait	I did that wrong	3.0
I did that wrong	Nevermind	0.0
So youre going to have to split something up right	Yeah	0.0
I always think about food	Oh food	0.0
Oh food	We could	0.0
We could	Okay lets start over	0.0
Okay lets start over	Any red marker	0.0
So	Eight pizzas for three people	3.0
Mmhmm	What is the total area of the floor	3.0
He went to the party	Well just say that	0.0
Well just say that	We dont	0.0
We dont have an answer	What is the total area for the	3.0
The larger whole question the pizza is somebody ate something right	Yes so	0.0
And then what would the question be	The question would be	0.0
So whats your question	How many pizza slices were	3.0
Everybody listen	Our numbers were 12 and 6	3.0
Okay	And so we did a subtraction problem	3.0
We were supposed to do multiplication	So we wrote Timmy had six pieces of pizza and ate half of that which was  three	3.0
What is this	three	3.0
What does that mean	Thats the answer	3.0
What	Leftover pieces of pizza	3.0
Anna	The three represents	0.0
The what	The numerator	3.0
The numerator	Oh nevermind	0.0
Carson	The answer	3.0
Can we be more specific	How much was eaten	3.0
You guys	Our numbers were 12 and 56	3.0
Our numbers were 12 and 56	Whats going on	2.0
Everybody listen up	Joe has 56 of a sandwich	3.0
Joe has 56 of a sandwich	And he eats 12 of the sandwich	3.0
And he eats 12 of the sandwich	How much of the sandwich is left for Joe	3.0
So my number model is 56 times 12	Yeah	0.0
Do you think its how much was left	Yeah	0.0
What does that answer represent	How much he ate	3.0
Cooper	Okay	0.0
Okay	A family is putting in a new guest room and are trying to find how much carpet they need	3.0
A family is putting in a new guest room and are trying to find how much carpet they need	Onefourth of the room will be blue and fourfifths of the room will be red	3.0
Onefourth of the room will be blue and fourfifths of the room will be red	What is total area of meters that room will need	3.0
Okay so what were your two numbers	14 and 45	3.0
So the 14 represented what	The 14 represented the blue carpet on the floor	3.0
The 14 represented the blue carpet on the floor	Because the familys putting in carpet and need to find the area of how much carpet its going to need	4.0
Because the familys putting in carpet and need to find the area of how much carpet its going to need	And 14 of the carpet is blue and 45 is red will be blue	1.0
And 14 of the carpet is blue and 45 is red will be blue	Will be	0.0
Will be	Fourfifths is red	1.0
Fourfifths is red	And then we finding a total area of meters in the room	1.0
Im just trying to understand	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Onefourth of a meter was blue	Well will be blue because theyre putting it in	3.0
Well will be blue because theyre putting it in	Theyre trying to figure out how much carpet they need to go to the store and get	3.0
Theyre trying to figure out how much carpet they need to go to the store and get	So they need to figure out how much theyll need	3.0
So they need to figure out how much theyll need	How many meters	1.0
What is your unit	Meters	3.0
And	And 45 will be red	3.0
Fourfifths will be red	And then we figured it out that its 1 120 because we did the	3.0
And then we figured it out that its 1 120 because we did the	The common denominator	1.0
So you	Because we did	0.0
What was your answer	1 120	3.0
So you guys added	No	0.0
No	No we did that because were doing area	4.0
No we did that because were doing area	We multiplied the 14 by the 45	4.0
Oh so whats 14 times 45 if you multiply if we use our algorithm what do you get	420	3.0
Which is the answer that you guys need to be trying to get	Well we tried to  common denominator	3.0
Does that make more sense to you	Yeah	0.0
Carson did you want to go next	Yes	0.0
Yes	You threw a party and ordered eight pizzas	3.0
You threw a party and ordered eight pizzas	You and your friends ate 23 of the pizzas	3.0
You and your friends ate 23 of the pizzas	How much of the pizza did you eat	3.0
Anna	13 of  How much	3.0
Okay does that work you guys	Mmhmm	1.0
Tom	Okay	0.0
Okay	Timmy had 23 of an apple	3.0
Timmy had 23 of an apple	He got 10 more apple baskets	3.0
He got 10 more apple baskets	How  does he have	3.0
Okay so 10 What	Timmy had 23 of an apple	3.0
Of an apple	Apple basket	3.0
Of a basket	He got 10 more baskets	3.0
10 more apples	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	An apple basket	1.0
An apple basket	How many apples does he have	1.0
How many apples does he have	Ms Gibson	0.0
Ms Gibson	I think you missed Because when he was reading it the second time I heard him say	1.0
I think you missed Because when he was reading it the second time I heard him say	If Im correct Tom	0.0
If Im correct Tom	Correct me if Im not	1.0
Correct me if Im not	23 of an apple basket am I correct	1.0
23 of an apple basket am I correct	At least thats what I heard	1.0
So do you want the number model to be what	23 times 10	3.0
7 6 and 23	Yeah 6 and 23	0.0
What does the 6 and 23 mean	How many apples	3.0
But did you ever tell me how many apples are in the basket	23 of	3.0
23 of an apple is in the basket	like the basket apple	0.0
23 of the basket are filled with apples	And 10 more apples	3.0
You added 10 more apples to that	It would be times	3.0
So it would be plus right	Yeah	0.0
If we had 10 apples what do we do with the fraction so that the number model had to be this	You could make	0.0
Alec	He ate 23 of the apples	3.0
What does the 6 and 23 represent	How many apples they ate	3.0
Okay lets do yours	Okay	0.0
Im ready	A class split a big chocolate bar	3.0
A class split a big chocolate bar	And the groups are A and B	3.0
I heard chocolate bar	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	A class split a big chocolate bar between group A and B	3.0
Okay so we have groups A and B	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	And group B took 56	3.0
And group B took 56	And group B took 23	3.0
23 of what	23 of chocolate bar	3.0
Of the chocolate bar	Mmhmm	0.0
If group B ate 56 of it could group A eat 23	Oh	0.0
So 23 of Kennedy	23 of 16	3.0
23 of 16	23 is supposed to be a 13	1.0
23 is supposed to be a 13	23 of the sixth	1.0
This should be 13	Yeah its supposed to be 13	3.0
So Group a ate 13 of what	The last sixth	3.0
Okay so 13 of what was left	Mmhmm	0.0
What does the 518 represent	How much of the chocolate bar they ate	3.0
Who ate	Group A	3.0
This is what you were doing just now right	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Yeah	1.0
Everybody say Representation	Representation	0.0
Cooper	Something that  so kind of like a picture of something	3.0
Yeah its a picture of something	Kind of like if you do 13 Ill show a picture of	3.0
All right as always I am available to help	I	0.0
Do you have a question	What do you mean like match them up	2.0
Im sorry	What do yo mean like match them up	2.0
You need to match the picture with the multiplication problem	You mean cut them out	0.0
Yeah	Oh its kind of like the	0.0
Matching game	Yeah	0.0
Youre going to work with your shoulder partner	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	We have your scissors	0.0
I like simple ones too	Four 16ths	3.0
Awesome	Three 12ths	3.0
Three 12th	Six 24ths	3.0
Awesome	16 24ths	3.0
Okay and lucky last	12 18ths	3.0
So thats	Six	3.0
Well I mean	Does that work	0.0
Well this isnt how you would ever express that	Oh	0.0
So what they would do is they would simplify that to one seventh	Yeah I know	0.0
One divided by seven you get the same number as if you divided this by this	But I cant just put down one seventh	3.0
But I cant just put down one seventh	Im finding the equivalent right	1.0
I already had a battle	Yeah	0.0
Are you guys checking each others	Yes	0.0
Isaac give me Justins best one	Oh I will probably say 14 12ths	3.0
Oh I will probably say 14 12ths	Two 12 16	3.0
Two		3.0
Yes who has two 14ths	Yeah	0.0
What was your favorite	What was my	0.0
Your favorite one of Isaacs	Four 28ths	3.0
What was your favorite Landon	Well its probably	0.0
Hes not the maths Ms Gibson	Yeah	0.0
All right did you guys showdown yet	Yeah	0.0
Brielle	My favorite was nine 24ths	3.0
My favorite was nine 24ths	Nine 24ths	3.0
Mia	Six 16ths	3.0
Aaron		3.0
Awesome	24 64ths	3.0
Okay so you have to sign in through your dashboard and then go to McGraw Hill	Oh okay	0.0
Once you go to Chromebook or once youre in your Factors are on page what		0.0
And the person doing multiples needs to find the first six multiples of the number eight	Im doing the first six multiples of eight	0.0
Colins got a good start		3.0
	All right found it	0.0
You have to understand what factors are and then you can find it	Now you have to find all three multiples of six	3.0
Now you have to find all three multiples of six	No theres six	3.0
No theres six	I already found the ones	0.0
I already found the ones	I found eight and sixes	1.0
Share with your neighbor	Eight 16 24 42 48	4.0
Eight 16 24 42 48	Eight 16 24 42 48	1.0
You already did amazing		3.0
Are you doing factors or multiples	Im doing	0.0
Are you factors or multiples	Im multiples	3.0
Did you read what multiples are	Isnt it like factors of a number that	3.0
Isnt it like factors of a number that	So its like multiplying one number by a different number	3.0
So list the first six	It can be like both answers	3.0
So eight times one is	Eight times what	0.0
So youre doing the first six multiples of the number eight	Oh okay	0.0
So eight times one is	You have to read	0.0
And youre doing factors	Mmhmm	0.0
All right	So what is a multiple	2.0
Joey	Its the number that you use to multiply to get to a number	3.0
So a number that you multiply with another number to get a Whats that fancy word	Fraction	3.0
Fraction	Sum	1.0
Sum	Product	1.0
So every product has two factors right	Mmhmm	0.0
Logan	One factor of 36 is one times 36	3.0
Okay so factors of 36 would be one and 36	Four and nine	3.0
Four and nine	Six and six	3.0
Six and six	Six times six	1.0
Any others	I have two and 18	3.0
Uhhuh	And I have three and 12	3.0
Did we get them all	Yup	0.0
So does that seem kind of random like a random order	Yeah	0.0
Are you with me Brody	Yup	0.0
One times what		3.0
Does two go into 36	Yes	0.0
Does three go into 36	Yes	0.0
Yes it does		3.0
Three times 12		3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yes	Four nines	3.0
Does five go into 36	No	0.0
Does six go into 36	Yes	0.0
Cooper	It is another product of another number sort of	3.0
The first six multiples of eight are what Anna	The first six multiples of eight are eight 16 24 32 40 and 48	4.0
So give me one factor pair of 36 Cooper	Six and six	3.0
Landon	So we can add numbers	3.0
So we can add what kind of numbers	Add fractions	3.0
And why do they have to have a common denominator	So they can be added easily	3.0
Mmhmm	Because say if its like one eighth plus one third you have to find a common denominator	4.0
Because	you can add them	3.0
you can add them	If you just add one third onto one eighth you dont really get an answer	4.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Like I dont know		0.0
		0.0
Hows that sound	Mmhmm	0.0
So five 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 okay		3.0
So what are we going to multiply it by	Eight	3.0
So what are we going to do to three eights Isaac	Were going to put it to one eight	3.0
What	Were going to put it to one eight	3.0
I cant hear you	Were going to put it to one eight	3.0
What are we going to multiply eighths by	Five	3.0
Joey	the denominator times three by times eight	3.0
And the quick common denominator those are the three strategies that youre going to list here on your page	Ms  can I go to the bathroom	0.0
Once you have listed those strategies you can continue with the problems that are on pages 156 and 157	Can we work with partners	0.0
George can you tell us what the two means	It means power of two	3.0
A little harder	Not really	0.0
You guys are awesome 10 to the third is	3000	3.0
All right heres some hard ones	God	0.0
Awesome	Thats a big number	0.0
George how did you figure it out	So you just put 900 and then you just add times 1 equals 900 and you just add three zeros	4.0
I dont know what that means	Yeah mines also	0.0
Got it	Yep	0.0
Why would I have you do so much talking about this Anna	So we know how to divide it	0.0
Yes	So that we know how to do the problem and how to explain our thinking	0.0
So you agree with him	Yes	1.0
I think that was about a minute	Yeah	0.0
Did everybody come to the same conclusion do you think	Yeah	1.0
Mia what order did you put your cards in	I put in order 96 divided by 3	3.0
Landon	Because its a large two digit number and youre only splitting it by three	4.0
Because its a large two digit number and youre only splitting it by three	So it will still have a large quotient	4.0
Joey	Me and my partner think that it doesnt work because youre subtracting more or dividing more from the bigger number	4.0
Me and my partner think that it doesnt work because youre subtracting more or dividing more from the bigger number	And youre taking nine from 63 which you would not get so far from that	4.0
Avery what would you add to that	I solved 96 divided by 3 its 63 divided by 9 is 7	4.0
What is this number called	The divisor	3.0
No	Dividend	3.0
Dividend	Dividend	1.0
And what is this number called	Quotient	3.0
Quotient	Divisor	1.0
Landon	My rule would be that the largest number in the dividend	3.0
Why	and the smaller numbers in the divisor	3.0
Yeah why	So that you have the biggest number being split into number of parts	4.0
Joey	So you could possibly subtract more and	4.0
Divide	divide more of the total	4.0
divide more of the total	So the reason you would want a three in the divisor is because then you would have to take away less	4.0
You would have fewer groups	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	To make the groups you would have to take away not nine but three	4.0
To make the groups you would have to take away not nine but three	Well because the smaller the divisor is the more times it goes into the dividend	4.0
Say it again Isaac	The smaller the divisor is the more times it goes into the dividend	4.0
Logan	The largest divisor	3.0
The largest	Youll get more more cake	3.0
If I take the largest divisor I get this little piece	You want the smallest divisor	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
You guys were good at explaining your thinking today	Thank you	0.0
So what youre going to do is play topic it with me	Sure	0.0
Do you have your cards	Cards	0.0
Cards	Yes	0.0
Whos ready to go	Me	0.0
Me	Me	0.0
Aaron will you play with me please	Yeah	0.0
And Aaron do you think that that is the best way for me to make this	No	0.0
Come on up	I would put 8 and the 4	4.0
I would put 8 and the 4	Because the two 8s are bigger than the 4	4.0
Why did you do that	Because	0.0
What did you get	Four	3.0
So her strategy tell me what your strategy was again	So my strategy was to put the four down here because	3.0
What is the name of that	The divisor	3.0
The divisor	And the two eights up there because therere higher than the four	4.0
Do you guys want to do it	Yeah	0.0
So is that pretty clear	Yes	0.0
The next thing I want to do No	Ive got	0.0
can you give me one	First one	0.0
Anna	Divided by	3.0
Isaac	Divisor	3.0
Dividend	Attached	3.0
Maybe	Quotient	3.0
What else	Attached	3.0
Attached	No	0.0
Does it	No attached	3.0
I mean thats what we practiced in our warmup but we didnt really use attach anything	Add	3.0
Add	And adding	3.0
Can Carson use part of your deck please	Sure	0.0
And then youre going to do it again	Are we doing this one	0.0
Are we doing this one	This page this side	0.0
So youre going to pick three more cards	You dont have to shuffle just grab three cards	0.0
Youre discussing	With your partner	0.0
You guys know what rules are right	Yeah	0.0
Once that shows up you can make revisions to things that	Things that you would kind of like revise and redo it I guess	3.0
Okay	Unless mine was picking it up	0.0
Maggie read it for me	I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule created to get the largest fraction in the game	0.0
George	I think it means to kind of justify your answer	3.0
Anna	Youre proving it	3.0
Did you guys figure out similarities	Yeah	0.0
Did you talk about similarities	I did	0.0
No one	was saying you could make that a whole number then you would report the number as a fraction	4.0
George	I think its similar to a fraction because sometimes when we do	0.0
Anna	So if we have a fraction  we can provide the numerator and common denominators	4.0
Max	The dividend	3.0
Sophia	Divisor	3.0
One strategy I think you guys all talked about where Joey what was the strategy from yesterday	Um	0.0
How would you arrange these cards for the biggest fraction	The biggest number on top	3.0
Biggest numbers on top and then	Smallest on the bottom	3.0
Gavin	55 and 8	3.0
Did I just prove to you which one is bigger	Yes	0.0
What do you see	I see  the answer because the smaller the denominator the bigger the answer	4.0
I see  the answer because the smaller the denominator the bigger the answer	So if you have a big denominator the answers gonna be a lot smaller	4.0
What do you notice Sophia	I notice the denominator and the divisor are the same thing	3.0
Sophia	Because the denominator	3.0
Anna	They could show how they did their work	1.0
Anything else	Maybe they could add like more words to make it make sense because my rule is the bigger the denominators or probably something different than denominators	1.0
Howard	We dont know what cards hes using	1.0
Im sorry	We dont know what cards hes using	1.0
Eric	The explanation	1.0
Because the larger the numerator the larger the	Dividend	3.0
That important word and then it works because the smaller the whats that word	Denominator	3.0
All right switch	That is getting nowhere	0.0
That is getting nowhere	Like the first half is perfect	1.0
Like the first half is perfect	But then the bottom when you get more to the bottom it doesnt get anywhere	1.0
Gavin	What I was so Id like to share that so they do like a whole paragraph rather than the last one where they did like one sentence	1.0
What I was so Id like to share that so they do like a whole paragraph rather than the last one where they did like one sentence	They did a full paragraph with first and second and then they had a conclusion sentence	1.0
Anybody else	It said did you know	0.0
It said did you know	Also did you know the numerator is the	0.0
Was that important	Yes	0.0
Why do you think its important	Because I dont know	2.0
Anna	I think that its important that you actually explain what youre doing	3.0
Aiden	I think that  is important because  dividends when theyre talking about the numerator like the reader could get confused	4.0
Max	I respectfully disagree	1.0
I respectfully disagree	I dont think it is important	3.0
I dont think it is important	I think it isnt important because he isnt actually explaining about what he did	4.0
I think it isnt important because he isnt actually explaining about what he did	He like um he said Did you know the numerators dividend	1.0
He like um he said Did you know the numerators dividend	And yeah like a random just you dont need to know	1.0
Do you have an idea Max	Um I think he could make it useful by changing the sentence after that and do like since the problem has fractions the numerator and the dividend would be the same thing to like because its a fraction and a division problem	4.0
Aiden	I changed my mind	0.0
I changed my mind	I agree with Max	1.0
I agree with Max	He could have drew a picture	1.0
George	I dont really see an explanation	1.0
I dont really see an explanation	I think he did the problem right but I noticed that his writing doesnt really make sense	1.0
Okay	So if he could be more explicit then that would help out	1.0
Whats a good strategy for making sure that your your sentences make sense	Not putting also because of not having random facts	4.0
Jonathan	I actually agree with George	1.0
I actually agree with George	And like he was just throwing stuff together and like it just kind of threw it in there	1.0
And like he was just throwing stuff together and like it just kind of threw it in there	Like he forgot like his third set	1.0
Like he forgot like his third set	He forgot his third paragraph and also a lot	1.0
He forgot his third paragraph and also a lot	And also I agree with Landon because you really dont need to know that the numerator is the dividend	1.0
And also I agree with Landon because you really dont need to know that the numerator is the dividend	Its not really that important	1.0
Unless youre explaining	Unless youre explaining what it is	0.0
Tell me what you did	So what I did is I put the parentheses near the four and five because that will equal nine	4.0
So what I did is I put the parentheses near the four and five because that will equal nine	And I know that nine if you go down three times it will equal three	4.0
Or nine divided by three	Yeah	0.0
Anna	One	3.0
Yeah so one and two thirds	Yeah	0.0
So what did you do	I first got  twenty	4.0
I first got  twenty	So then were going to do four plus two which will be six	4.0
So then were going to do four plus two which will be six	And then six times five is 30	4.0
And then six times five is 30	Yeah	0.0
What did you do	I did minus two first because that would be negative two	4.0
I did minus two first because that would be negative two	And then I did two plus four which sorry then I did plus three which is one and two times four	4.0
And then I did two plus four which sorry then I did plus three which is one and two times four	Two times four is eight	4.0
Two times four is eight	And then that would be nine	4.0
And then that would be nine	Oh wait nevermind	3.0
14 plus 16 is 30 right	Yeah	0.0
So the only other thing you could do is the middle right	So can I say what I think	0.0
What do you think it is	So I think its easy to do two plus eight first and then turn on that so that 10 times 7 is 70 and 10 times 2	4.0
Or 70 times two	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Would be 140	3.0
Okay last one	Im stuck	2.0
Howd you whatd you think	I thought you should you should do three question four and then you should times 55 then minus two by four then two then it was double	4.0
I thought you should you should do three question four and then you should times 55 then minus two by four then two then it was double	So thats how you get there	0.0
Like a quiz	Yeah	0.0
Cause when I give you guys a quiz what am I trying to do	Test us	3.0
On so that why	So you can know what we learned	3.0
So I can what	Know what we learned	3.0
Alec will you read that for us	I will know Im successful when I can justify a rule	0.0
You have the answer	I think Sam because you dont have the denominator	4.0
So Aiden will you say that out loud again	Thats incorrect because you cant add the denominator together	4.0
Lyla	I would show that if you see from in the fifths section three fifths is less than the number that you would even multiply or add together	4.0
Three fifths is less than what	Two thirds	3.0
Is there another tool you could show me with	if you add one half thats more than one third	4.0
Thats more than a more than a whole	Im thinking you would have probably one sixth	3.0
Aiden	Just to let you know that the battery on the swivel it says battery low	0.0
Talk about just that information and how do you know	And how do I know	0.0
And how do I know	She had the denominator and five plus one is  and twelve minus ten is negative numbers	4.0
Anna	I dont think the answer makes sense	3.0
Caleb	I agree with her	1.0
I agree with her	I dont think it makes sense	3.0
I dont think it makes sense	Because if your minus then five minus one is not going to stay five	4.0
To you	No it doesnt make sense because you cant have if we have the  denominator the you cant	4.0
You want to go point at something	If you have five slices and you were to take away one you wouldnt have five slices left you would have four slices left	4.0
What do you know about five tenths and subtracting	I know its hard	0.0
I dont know which one of these	Its the purple one	3.0
Okay	There it is	0.0
There it is	Its five out of 10	4.0
What is that	Its five tenths	3.0
What is that	Its half	3.0
Aiden	Half	3.0
It needs to be a half	One of them needs to be	0.0
One of them needs to be	One of the numbers have to be half or a whole	3.0
So is this correct	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Avery what do you start with	Id start with adding	3.0
Okay so why how do you know you can add the numerators	Because the denominators are the same	4.0
Anna	We cant add those parts because  different denominators	4.0
Tell me in terms of this	It means that you have to	0.0
So if I say you get three pieces out of all of these Im going to give you this piece and this piece and this piece is that fair	No	0.0
Why	Because theyre different sizes	4.0
So we can we can count 123 12ths plus 1234 equals how many 12ths	712ths	3.0
Aiden	7	3.0
7	I knew that half of it twelve plus 3 equals 7 or half of 12 was 6 to six	4.0
Go ahead and talk to him	Because 1213ths is almost a whole	4.0
Or is it closer to two	Its closer to two	3.0
And how did you know Anna	I know because I have	0.0
Okay go	Exactly	0.0
Exactly	That would be three	3.0
Are you guys working together	in solutions because oh however the middle would be better	4.0
Okay so what did you Whats your answer	I think its closer to zero	3.0
Brody	Because minusing a half from that it wouldnt be a half again	4.0
Say it again	So youre taking so youre taking away a half	3.0
So I just want to make sure I understand what youre saying	So youre taking so theres the one half there that doesnt mean it would be one half again	4.0
So youre taking so theres the one half there that doesnt mean it would be one half again	Like you wouldnt be closest to one half	4.0
After	After you after you get your answer	0.0
Aiden	So what I was gonna explain is you do have minus seven and a half minus seven is three and a half	4.0
So what I was gonna explain is you do have minus seven and a half minus seven is three and a half	I know that three and a half is	4.0
A half minus seven	is three and a half	3.0
So were starting with a happy understand that and were taking away this number	Oh sorry	0.0
Landon	So its a half	0.0
So half minus a little bit less than half is closer to	Zero	3.0
Just talk us through it	So what I did was I looked at the whole because that way  one and a half	4.0
So what I did was I looked at the whole because that way  one and a half	And then a third is	3.0
And then youre going to do what	And then Im going to add a third to it	3.0
And then Im going to add a third to it	I thought the third would be past the two	3.0
For you to get started	Number one because then these arent or should we just skip them	0.0
If you want	Okay what I thought was about the future	0.0
Caleb will you read our learning intention please	improving and breaking apart	0.0
Okay so Eric can you give me an example of a mixed number	Like 3 and one fourth	3.0
Isaac can you give me an example of a fraction thats greater than one	Five thirds	3.0
We can also compose it into what would be the improper fractions here anybody	Three and two fourths	3.0
Three and two fourths	So the only	0.0
Improper fraction	14 fourths	3.0
And everybody say composing	Composing	0.0
Composing	Composing	0.0
Isaac will you read that please	I will know I am successful when I can  improper fraction	0.0
Between two numbersOkay so Anna what did you get	One and two	3.0
What two whole numbers is that one in between	Three and two	3.0
How did you know its between two and three	Because its two  is how many twos are in five and then five is in between no its in between two and three	4.0
He said there are two and then theres how much leftover	One	3.0
So Eric you want to explain that for us	I am honestly kind of confused thats just  increased but also the top number did as the equal like the same cuz Im kinda confused with this	2.0
But tell me what is that	That is um	0.0
17 divided by three right	Yeah	0.0
Sophia and you tell us why	Because four times six equals 24	4.0
Because four times six equals 24	Theres two left over	4.0
Theres two left over	So thats six	4.0
Whats the strategy	Multiplication	3.0
Hello right	Right	0.0
And then how many are leftovers	One	3.0
One	One	1.0
First	Record it as a fraction	3.0
And what is that fraction	15	3.0
Anna	So I kind of did the same thing	1.0
So I kind of did the same thing	and so four times five is twenty and twenty divided by five is four	4.0
Say really loud like youre screaming across the room because I want to draw a picture of it	So five times five and three times five is 15 and four fives	4.0
six	Four is ten	3.0
So if you can	What else do we have	2.0
How many fifths	Theres nothing but 21	3.0
So that would be three and	I dont know what to do	2.0
Alright any any great ideas	Oh me and Joey are kind of stuck because we get three times seven equals 21	4.0
Oh me and Joey are kind of stuck because we get three times seven equals 21	And we dont know much what to do because we did three groups of seven	4.0
And we dont know much what to do because we did three groups of seven	And now we dont know how to turn it into a fraction	2.0
Anna what were you thinking	If you could take 21 fifths and multiply it by	3.0
Im sorry what	One	3.0
Landon I heard you give me one	I did two and	3.0
Okay can you come up and explain yours	I actually figured out three of them	0.0
Stand next to it	So I figured out two wholes and 11 fifths	3.0
So I figured out two wholes and 11 fifths	Two wholes and then 5 10 11 fifths	3.0
So this is your edreports three what did I say	Three and 23	0.0
Pages 90 and 91	Two and 35	0.0
So	That means one and 13	3.0
That means one and 13	One and 13	3.0
If you have one left over it would be	Thats a lot	0.0
So does that make it easier	Three and 23	0.0
Can you show me a mixed number	Two	3.0
Yep	And	0.0
So can you pull out one whole	Yeah	0.0
How many thirds	Theres two and two thirds	3.0
How many thirds are left	One third	3.0
No	Two	3.0
How many thirds are left	Five	3.0
Or so that would be one	Okay	0.0
Okay so you guys can get started on pages 90 and 91	Can we work together	0.0
So what is that next number	Im going to use this	0.0
Four	Right now honestly	0.0
How many parts does it take to make a whole	I can never get an	0.0
Just go	Find another name for	0.0
So youre accounting for this one how many thirds is that	We watch this for the example	0.0
So write that	So how many squares	2.0
Thats the numerator	Four threes	3.0
Four threes	So one and 12 tenths	1.0
So one and 12 tenths	Thats already	0.0
One and 13	I need one more	3.0
But I want you to think in your head what are we going to be doing today	Adding and subtracting fractions	3.0
Talk to your neighbor	Add and subtract fractions and	3.0
Add and subtract fractions and	Of a fraction that people have done	3.0
What tool	A number line	3.0
Any other any other things that youve heard or said that you would like to share	Splitting numbers into either or turning numbers into either improper fractions or mixed numbers	3.0
Ilea	Fraction circles	3.0
We use fraction circles	Number line	3.0
Number line	Division	3.0
Aiden	Because I know that the eight is worth 800 and the 9 is worth 90 and the zeros worth 0 and the seven is 7000	4.0
How do you know the 7 is 7000	The 7 is in the thousands place	3.0
Tyler	32 million 800 thousand	3.0
32 million 800 thousand	Its a big number	0.0
32 million	32 million 800 thousand	3.0
Eight hundred	Eight hundred	0.0
Ninetyfive	Ninetyfive million	3.0
Thats in the what place	Thousands	3.0
Thousands	Thousand four hundred seventytwo	3.0
Just the number you wrote down	20 million	3.0
Anna	929 million 867 thousand 135	3.0
How much flour do they need in all	Where are we supposed to write it	0.0
Okay and did you estimate that	No	0.0
Okay or how many thirds is that	Three	3.0
Sophia	Four thirds	3.0
Anna	So two thirds plus two thirds is four thirds	4.0
So two thirds plus two thirds is four thirds	So if these are the same then you can add them easily	4.0
So if these are the same then you can add them easily	And you could just add the top and thats four	4.0
Okay can you show us on here	So it would be right about	0.0
And then if we added another two thirds what would you do with that	You would add that and that would be four thirds but the next number is one and a third	4.0
So if you used	Right here	0.0
Bricker	The good thing about using a number line is that  where your fractions are	3.0
The good thing about using a number line is that  where your fractions are	So it shows between zero and one and two	1.0
So it shows between zero and one and two	You can tell that because it says between zero and one so you can tell where the fractions are	4.0
I really like that answer	Also it helps prove your answer cause it shows how you can get your answer with fractions	4.0
Aiden	I think the benefits of a number line is is you have like all the numbers like lets say youre getting 15 to plus two fifths and you can see a 15 is here and add two fifths by walking three fourths and a four	4.0
Go	So three fourths and two fourths would be around four and a half	4.0
Switch	One fourth	3.0
One fourth	And I got	0.0
And I got	Yeah I agree	1.0
Yeah I agree	Two fourths would be around four and a half	1.0
Two fourths would be around four and a half	I got four and 14	1.0
Anna	My estimate was two plus two and a half	3.0
Two plus two and a half equal	Four and a half	3.0
Anna call on somebody	My number model was one and three fourths plus two and two fourths equals four and one fourth	4.0
George	So what I did was I added one plus 2 and then I added 3 fourths plus 2 fourths and I got 5 fourths	4.0
So what I did was I added one plus 2 and then I added 3 fourths plus 2 fourths and I got 5 fourths	And I got a whole with a remainder of one fourth so four and one fourth	4.0
What would an estimate be for this one	Three	3.0
So what did you start with	Three as a whole number	3.0
What is this closest to	Zero	3.0
Addition subtraction multiplication division	Subtraction	3.0
Okay so two minus and then what is this close to	One	3.0
So is it close to one one and a half or two	One and a half	3.0
Ashley	One half	3.0
Aiden	Two and one sixth minus one and four sixths	3.0
Anna	I couldnt do one minus four	3.0
You couldnt take four sixths away from one sixth right	Yeah so I converted	3.0
Can I show your work	Okay	0.0
Joey	So I know that there are two  theres two remaining	4.0
So I know that there are two  theres two remaining	And then theres one sixth left	4.0
And then theres one sixth left	And then once you get rid of  one sixth plus two sixths is three sixths	4.0
Bridger	So I kind of added mine but I separated the wholes from the fractions and I did two minus one equals one and then I did one six one minus 4 equals 3 and then we add it to the sixths so it equals one and three sixths	4.0
Okay so Caleb would you mind explaining why do you think it is	I think its one and a half because I took two minus one and I got one	4.0
Uhhuh	And then we have one more sixth left over	4.0
And then we have one more sixth left over	Two and one sixth	4.0
Two and one sixth	And then subtracted four sixths from one sixth and got three sixths	4.0
So then what did you do with that	I changed a whole number into a fraction	3.0
So you guys have some different strategies for proving	Now that I think of it three sixths basically a half	3.0
Now that I think of it three sixths basically a half	So thats about the same	3.0
Yours	Yeah and the half	3.0
Okay um for those of you who like algorithms you can take Tom did you have a question	So what if you subtracted it different	2.0
So what if you subtracted it different	Like you did the fractions first then the actual number	2.0
So do you want to show us how you did that	So what I did	0.0
Lets see	So if you want to subtract four from one sixth you would have to get rid of this and make it a one	4.0
So if you want to subtract four from one sixth you would have to get rid of this and make it a one	But then that would turn into 7	4.0
But then that would turn into 7	And then if you did 4 minus 7 you would have	4.0
And then if you did 4 minus 7 you would have	And that means youd have three sixths	3.0
So one and seven sixths is the same as two and one six right	Mmhm	0.0
Would you agree with that	Mmhm	0.0
Mmhm	Yeah	1.0
Andrea	I think I have one more way to do it but its a different answer	2.0
Equivalent is what	Equal	3.0
Tom	They lead to the same answer	3.0
Why do we need to know how to make equivalent fractions if were adding fractions	Because if theyre not equivalent and if they have different denominators like one and six you cant add them together	4.0
Ilea	Denominator	3.0
Could you explain to us why how do you know that three fourths is bigger than one half	Because two fourths is a half so	4.0
How did you know two fourths was a half	one fourth in there so	3.0
And how do you do How did you know how to figure	A half is four eighths	4.0
A half is four eighths	That means that three eighths is less than a half	4.0
Landon can you explain to us how you know two thirds is greater than a half	I know because if you look at the fraction circle chart you can see that two thirds is bigger than a half	4.0
I know because if you look at the fraction circle chart you can see that two thirds is bigger than a half	So but the problem is two thirds and then one half and two thirds goes right here and one half goes right here	4.0
Show me	I figures out to  down because I was doing this	3.0
Hey Joey can you tell us how you knew that 14 plus two fourths was bigger than a half	One fourth plus two fourths is three fourths equals bigger than one half	4.0
How do you know that	Because three fourths is one fourth more than a half	4.0
Show me	I preferred the other problem	0.0
Okay Aiden do you want to tell us	I knew that one half is half  of one whole	4.0
I knew that one half is half  of one whole	Then I knew that was not half or above	4.0
Then I knew that was not half or above	So then I knew	4.0
Can you add and subtract denominators	No	0.0
So if you start with a half what does it take to make a whole	Another half	3.0
Is a third bigger or smaller than a half	Smaller	3.0
Cooper	So three fourths would be bigger than two thirds	4.0
So three fourths would be bigger than two thirds	So three thirds or three fourths	4.0
If we start with two thirds whats it take what do you need to add to two thirds to get to one	One 13	3.0
Is that bigger than 13	Yeah	0.0
How do you know what a fourth is	Because	0.0
Okay tell me how you know for sure what a fourth is	Okay	0.0
Okay	A whole is four of fourths	3.0
Okay so you are supposed to figure out what a fourth plus an eighth is Landon	Oh	0.0
Oh	Can I go to the bathroom	0.0
I didnt have I didnt hear anybody talking to your partners	To make one fourth	3.0
To make one fourth	Wait one fourth equals two eighths	1.0
Wait one fourth equals two eighths	I agree	1.0
What is that	Thats one fourth	3.0
Okay	And if you take	0.0
Whats that	One eighth	3.0
Okay	And another one eighth is three	3.0
Come on up	All of these	3.0
All of these	And you have to set up the circle	3.0
Okay	And there are two eighths remaining from this	3.0
Okay so your answer was	Two eighths equals one fourth	3.0
What I see out here is  we have a fifth plus are these tenths	Yes	0.0
So what size is that	Fifths	3.0
And that is what five	Its a fifth	3.0
Mia	Its thirds	3.0
What size is common to both of them	Sixths	3.0
Okay so your assignment did I get those page back	Yeah	0.0
What would be the number model for that	One fourth plus two fourths equals three fourths	4.0
Lydia	Thats a half an hour	3.0
Thats not what I asked	Thirty minutes	3.0
Haley	What I did was 5 sixths plus 2 sixths equals 7 sixths	4.0
How do you know youre correct	Cause if you just get rid of the sixths and you just add five plus two it equals seven	4.0
Cause if you just get rid of the sixths and you just add five plus two it equals seven	Then you just add the sixths	4.0
Okay can you think of a model or a tool that you can use to predict	You could use fraction circles	3.0
Caleb	I did three sixths plus four sixths equals seven sixths	4.0
And how do you know its true	Because regularly three plus four equals seven	4.0
Joey did formulating	I technically included a whole	3.0
A whole	Uhhuh	0.0
How do you know that thats correct	Because one whole equals 6 sixths and if you add one sixth that would be seven sixths	4.0
Okay go ahead	So the first thing I did was four fifths plus one cause one is five fifths	4.0
So the first thing I did was four fifths plus one cause one is five fifths	And five fifths plus four fifths is nine fifths	4.0
You guys listen up	Then what I did was one half plus one half which made five fifths and two fifths and then I did another two fifths	4.0
Awesome	That basically just breaks up this  nine fifths	3.0
Joey	Were there even be a half	3.0
Im sorry	Would there even be a half of a fifth	3.0
A half plus a half equals a whole right	Mmhm	0.0
So you also could do so what Im asking is can you think of any others	Like the x up in the top right corner	0.0
Cooper	Could a half be eighths	3.0
Whats another fraction for a half	Four eighths	3.0
Two fourths plus four eighths plus	Four fifths	3.0
So one strategy would be to look for fractions that you know like half that you can make a bunch of different denominators out of	I know another denominator for a half	0.0
I know another denominator for a half	Three sixths	3.0
Uh huh	Four eighths	3.0
What is a different one	Sixteenths	3.0
Sixteenths	Eight	3.0
What	Eight sixteenths	3.0
You can talk to your neighbor about some of the fractions you think might work	You could do five twelfths plus five twelfths I guess	3.0
You could do five twelfths plus five twelfths I guess	Five twelfths plus five twelfths	3.0
Five twelfths plus five twelfths	Seven twelfths	1.0
Seven twelfths	We could do 4 8ths plus two	3.0
We could do 4 8ths plus two	Four 8ths	3.0
Four 8ths	Oh yeah	1.0
Oh yeah	Five plus six plus	1.0
These are not easy to do are they	Mrs Gibson	0.0
Mrs Gibson	Im pretty sure they can just go together if you get them close enough	0.0
Im pretty sure they can just go together if you get them close enough	Oh I know what you have to do	0.0
Is this a sixth	Yeah its a sixth	3.0
Yeah its a sixth	Look up there	0.0
Look up there	Its the same colors	0.0
Its the same colors	Its light blue	0.0
What else did you have Tom	I did four eighths plus 3	3.0
Four 8ths plus 3	Two 8ths	3.0
Did you say four eighths	Yep	0.0
Yep	Four 8ths plus four plus three 8ths	3.0
Plus two fourths	Two eighths	3.0
This is three twelfths right	Uhhuh	0.0
Parker	What I did kind of was I had two sixths I had two thirds	3.0
Two twelfths	One sixth	3.0
Okay so he would get to X out this one	And a third	3.0
Page three oh three	You can just click up top	0.0
If I click on that	Yeah I believe itll take you to it	0.0
Yeah I believe itll take you to it	Go down there and do the pages right there	0.0
Go down there and do the pages right there	Youve got to delete	0.0
Models often	Help explain	3.0
Jason you want to explain that one	So I got one because I know five eighths is one over is just just over a half	4.0
So I got one because I know five eighths is one over is just just over a half	So it cant be a half	4.0
So it cant be a half	Because then were adding because then were adding more to it	4.0
Because then were adding because then were adding more to it	So be farther from the half and closer to the one	4.0
George will you explain that one to me	You look at So to get two you need one more eighth	4.0
What number are you talking about	So to get seven eighths to get one more eighth and seven eighths is larger than one sixth	4.0
So to get seven eighths to get one more eighth and seven eighths is larger than one sixth	So you can make one more whole to get three	4.0
Lets see Sophia why do you think its two	Five fifths is an improper fraction so I feel it is one and two thirds	4.0
Anna	One and one third	3.0
Joey	Three times two is six so 13 would be two sixths which is really close to a half	4.0
Retell	Retell the problem in your own words	0.0
Retell the problem in your own words	Figure out what you want to find	0.0
Whats the first thing you do	You could probably read it in your own words	3.0
Aaron	Get help	3.0
From	The teacher	3.0
Or	Your partner	3.0
Anna	You can think about what you know about the problem	3.0
Cooper	You can annotate the problem like whats important in the problem and what you need to do	3.0
You want to get started	Read problem again	0.0
Okay try to solve that with your partner	So she mixes one and a half	3.0
So she mixes one and a half	So well like shes got one and a half and one and a half	4.0
So well like shes got one and a half and one and a half	Thats three	4.0
Thats three	So	1.0
So	Thats three	3.0
Thats three	Three	1.0
Three	Yeah its three	1.0
Yeah its three	One and one is two	4.0
One and one is two	One half plus one half equals one	4.0
Do you have another way	Yes what I did was I kind annotated the problem like what was important	4.0
Yes what I did was I kind annotated the problem like what was important	You needed to have one half plus one half and they separated the fraction so I did one plus one equals two	4.0
Anna	I drew a picture	3.0
Howd you know	There was four zeros  and eight hundred and ten thousand and only three and so I knew that there was one left over	4.0
How many zeros are in the dividend	Two	3.0
Joey will you read it for us	I will know I am successful when I can explain how I solve fraction problems when there is a remainder	0.0
Cooper	When theres a remainder you can ignore it or put it as a fraction	3.0
Avery	That you cant divide it	3.0
If you have a half an eight apples	Its like a whiteboard	0.0
Its like a whiteboard	Theres a whiteboard	0.0
Maybe this ones better	I dont think the color blue likes you	0.0
Something is up	I dont think no color likes you	0.0
Right	So or maybe if you push it	0.0
So or maybe if you push it	Then you have to push it again	0.0
I shouldnt have you guys sharing	So you could do with the numbers	3.0
So what if you just counted 1212	And then thats four of these	3.0
What is half of nine	Four and a half	3.0
Joey	I have a strategy for solving the 8 one	3.0
Uh huh	So should I come up	0.0
Awesome	Alright so Im not going to draw but	0.0
Alright so Im not going to draw but	So what is 2 and 4 and thats the simple 8 because you go the other way you go backwards thats 8 then its like a division problem	4.0
So what is 2 and 4 and thats the simple 8 because you go the other way you go backwards thats 8 then its like a division problem	So	0.0
Isaac	Four	3.0
Or do you want to just tell us	I did like the same thing Joey did	1.0
You did what	I did like the same thing Joey did	1.0
So you used the relationship between the multiplication and division	That one was a little bit more tricky so you could use multiplication table	3.0
Huh	You can use the multiplication table out of this	3.0
You want to show us Rylen	Can I come up	0.0
Can you what	Can I come up	0.0
Uhhuh	Well I did the same as Logan	1.0
Well I did the same as Logan	I did 13 divided by three to get nine	4.0
Okay so you took 13 divided by three	Yeah	0.0
Thinking	Four but you have a remainder	3.0
Whats the remainder	One	3.0
Okay so what would you call that one Four and	One third	3.0
I do	I just drew 13 and then cut one into thirds and then the others are four	4.0
Cooper	So what I did was I kind of did like counting them sort of	3.0
Or did you just count	I made the lines first and I circled each four so then I had four fifteen and thirteen	4.0
I made the lines first and I circled each four so then I had four fifteen and thirteen	And then the remainder of one which I recorded as a fraction	4.0
So thatll be another way to show	Mrs Gibson	0.0
Mrs Gibson	Real quick	0.0
Real quick	I dont think that 13 correct because if you add them together that equals a whole	4.0
I dont think that 13 correct because if you add them together that equals a whole	So wouldnt that be over	4.0
So 12 plus one is 13	Oh yeah	0.0
Yep	Basically so putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	3.0
Basically so putting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12	And then 2	3.0
Chase you want to show us or tell us	I agree with Logan	1.0
I agree with Logan	So I did 14 divided by three which equals four remainder two and which I also know equals 4 and 23	4.0
Colin	Can I draw something	0.0
Yes please	I did something kind of like Logans	1.0
I did something kind of like Logans	I drew 14	3.0
a third of 14	Fourteen	3.0
Fourteen	And then I grouped them in fours	3.0
Because theyre dividing by three	Right	0.0
You guys have a new appreciation for what teachers do	Yeah cause theyre all day doing that	0.0
So what is a fourth of three	Three fourths	3.0
And I think were disrupting I will know Im successful when Chase will you read that part	I will know I am successful when I can plot ordered pairs	0.0

6 5	He says 6 5	1.0
Aiden	What I see is 00 and these add this was six and five is eleven	3.0
Joey	I was gonna say that I think its 6 6	3.0
And y axis the grocery stores at five	But its not on this line	3.0
But its not on this line	Its in the 6 area of the walk	4.0
Its in the 6 area of the walk	If you erase all that its going to be above the line	4.0
Landon	Cause even if you go up and across you still gotta add them up	4.0
Cause even if you go up and across you still gotta add them up	And so even if we go four up to the five and then go over two youve got to add the four horizontal plus the two horizontal equals the six plus	4.0
And five vertically	I said that exact same thing on my journal page	3.0
Brielle how many blocks	Ten	3.0
You all agree	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	1.0
No	Yes	1.0

Is that what they said	No	0.0
Joey	Post office	3.0
Brielle	The ice cream shop	3.0
Sorry	The ice cream shop	3.0
Landon	Park entrance	3.0
You have another one	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You can take a detour	3.0
Could your friend be at the gas station	No because its not nine blocks away from the movie theater	4.0
No because its not nine blocks away from the movie theater	Has to be nine blocks away from the movie theater and seven blocks away from the boat rental	1.0
So it has to be nine blocks from the movie theater seven blocks from the boat rental and six blocks from the gas station	Oh I found it	0.0
Oh I found it	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	Thats the same thing you circled all this time	0.0
So Alec where do you think your friend is	The pizzeria because we already said he is 9 blocks from the movie theater but then hes 7 blocks from the boat rental and six blocks from the gas station	4.0
Jacob	Three fifths is inaudible one half It could be a tie between both	3.0
Three fifths is inaudible one half It could be a tie between both	But since its since its 35th its a little bit than half	4.0
But since its since its 35th its a little bit than half	And then if you add it to 14th its closer	4.0
Clay	inaudible	0.0
seven eigths is close to what	A whole	3.0
And 56ths is close to	A whole	3.0
And inaudible	So its a whole minue a whole	3.0
Actually turn to a neighbor and tell them why what its closest to	Its closest to inaudiblebecause if you add like the numbers then its close to inaudible	4.0
Its closest to inaudiblebecause if you add like the numbers then its close to inaudible	Theres Already a one there	4.0
You all good	Yup	0.0
And this is about one and two minus one is one	But its the same denominator	3.0
Yeah	So you would know	3.0
anybody feel strongly that it should be a half	So  210ths is not 210ths is not that big	3.0
So  210ths is not 210ths is not that big	So to minus it so its closest to half inauidble	3.0
Richard you want to explain that	Because so the denominators are really close to inauidble One and both of them plus Inaudible closer to zero inaudiblebe a half which would be like 5 or something	4.0
Do you have a straight edge	I have one	0.0
You guys should have does  everybody should have a geometry template right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
51 so that should go straight from 81 to 51	inaudible there is another 51	3.0
Stephanie if you double zero What do you get	Zero	3.0
Bishop What do you think	I think its going to be bigger	3.0
What do you mean greater	He said he said bigger	1.0
Wow	I think its going to be bigger because he had double both coordinates	4.0
Yeah	So its bigger across and taller	3.0
Aden can you read it really loudly	Double the first number of the original pair and inaudible	0.0
What would that whats that sailboat kind of look like Richard	I think it might be a little bigger but a different shape Because youre leaving one the same	4.0
What do you think Jacob	I think its also be a little bigger but I think its gonna be like a stop sign like up there like smooshed and then its inaudible	3.0
What do you think Adam	inaudible	0.0
Aden What do you think	I think its is going to be as tall as the original sailboat but longer	3.0
All right well go to the next slide	Thats one thing Im bad at	0.0
Showdown	How did you get four	2.0
Do you guys agree	That makes sense	0.0
That makes sense	Im going to put three down	3.0
Im going to put three down	You right you right	1.0
Okay if you guys agree stand up	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Wait	0.0
Wait	Ten yeah	3.0
I want you to think how did you figure this out Eli	I counted two threes and then I got to twelve	4.0
I counted two threes and then I got to twelve	I knew that was two thirds because three times four equals twelve	4.0
I knew that was two thirds because three times four equals twelve	So I did three times four	4.0
So I did three times four	I knew that was twelve then I saw there was eleven so I subtracted one so then I knew it was three and two thirds	4.0
Really loud	Three times two is six so you start of with six thirds	4.0
Three times two is six so you start of with six thirds	You add two thirds to make it eight thirds	4.0
The answer should have been two and two fifths Logan	Because you can only fit five into seven one time	4.0
And	And that would give it another whole	3.0
Theyre going to be different so justify your answer	How did you get that	2.0
How did you get that	Sixteen seventeen	3.0
Seven and three halves	Yeah	0.0
Im sorry	Three	3.0
Sierra	Eight and one half	3.0
Okay	Ethan said you guys werent interesting and exciting	0.0
Ethan said you guys werent interesting and exciting	Wow Ethan	0.0
Wow Ethan	Seventeen halves	3.0
Help me read that please	I can order pairs interpret coordinate values in context	0.0
Gunner will you read that for us please	correctly graphing accurately and answer the questions	0.0
Everybody say extrapolate	Extrapolate	0.0
What do you guys think	Three point seven but on here its seven point three	3.0
Three point seven but on here its seven point three	And then seven point eleven its eleven point seven and then the rest is right	3.0
So Abigailla did she write them correctly	She wrote the first one	3.0
Whats wrong with the second one	The second one is backwards	3.0
The second one is backwards	So you do horizontal and then vertical	3.0
Fletcher	I noticed that all the ages are four years apart and not five	4.0
Sure	Do we connect them	0.0
What would the next one be	Three seven	3.0
So what you should have noticed is that you could draw a straight line through Lilith and Noahs ages and why is there a straight line relationship Fletcher	They go up by two	4.0
So its because Lilith always what	By two	4.0
Avery	Lilith has more ages	3.0
So what happened	Lilith is older by four years	3.0
Avery are you going to say something weird	Technically your age can change because the younger person can have a birthday and get older but then you wont have a birthday	0.0
Thats not how your age works	Yes	0.0
Did you solve it	No	0.0
Why	You dont need to solve it because its a yes or no question and	4.0
Abigail	So you didnt have to solve it because it its minus 50 and thats not plus 50	4.0
So you didnt have to solve it because it its minus 50 and thats not plus 50	It wouldnt be greater than 45 times nine	4.0
How do you know Ethan	Because 25 times nine up there then theres 25 times nine up there plus eight which is added to it	4.0
Fletcher	Its times two	3.0
How do you know	Because its going to turn out zero because the numbers are the same	4.0
Because its going to turn out zero because the numbers are the same	I dont exactly know the exact number but I know its going to be the same exact number so when you subtract both then its going to be zero	4.0
Chris	The answer is going to be in two groups because dividing by two youve got to split the answer into two groups	4.0
Because if youre dividing by two the answers going to be	Half of it	3.0
How do you know Julian	Because once you do the	4.0
Because once you do the	But you divide by half and then you just get it exactly halfway	4.0
So you would divide it by two	Yes	0.0
All right Austin how do you know	I know because if youre multiplying by two its going to be two times as large	4.0
Drew	Five four	3.0
Does everybody know what a rule is	Yeah	0.0
This is her rule	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So how do you double it	2.0
So how do you double it	That way	3.0
That way	Or	0.0
When its the first coordinate which axis	That one	3.0
So if she doubles that side	Which is that one right	3.0
How would you describe that compared to the first one	Longer	3.0
So I would call that wider	Yeah	0.0
And you could say how much its going to be wider by too	Do we do both of these	0.0
What	Do we do both of these	0.0
How did that change it	Made it wider longer	3.0
So if you just double the first coordinate what do you think is going to happen to the sailboat	Will it be	0.0
Is the first coordinate what makes it tall or is the first coordinate what makes it wide	Wide	3.0
Then what is it going to do to it	Good job	0.0
So go ahead and put it on there	Its there	0.0
Where are your math tools	Do I do 18	0.0
Use your straight edge and connect them	Since weve all gone through both pages do we do the red boxes	0.0
Im going to give you about three more minutes to finish it up	Hi I have one last problem	0.0
Okay good job	All right so I thought it would be wider	3.0
All right so I thought it would be wider	Got to do the next page	0.0
Im sorry what	Got to do that last problem	0.0
Thank you	So I think itll be wider because	3.0
Do you want a different one	Im good	0.0
Okay gotcha	This is the right triangle right	3.0
No	Oh its not	0.0
So a right triangle has to have two edges	Yeah	0.0
So this is the triangle right	Yeah	0.0
So they have bisected that triangle to make a right triangle do you see that	Oh	0.0
So in order for this to be a right triangle one of these angles would have to be right	Oh okay	0.0
So do you have a question for me or are you good	Im good	0.0
Are you done	Yeah	0.0
Okay are you done	Mmhmm	0.0
Oh you did	Yeah	0.0
Did you agree	Yeah	1.0
Were you specific	Yep	0.0
So here I could put how much wider thats not specific	Five you said its going to be wider than five because theyre doubling it	4.0
Five	Well yeah it would be 10 because what you divided five by is	4.0
Its	Because you dont double the second numbers	4.0
So zero times two	Zero times two is	0.0
You have to multiply the first one by two	Oh	0.0
Josh	Its what you would do like I remember doing the rule books in like second grade its telling you what to do like times two or times four	3.0
So something you do to a number maybe	Yeah	0.0
So in this case you doubled the first coordinate right	Mmhmm	0.0
Are we clear about that	Yeah	0.0
Drew	I thought it was going to be longer and wider	3.0
Why did you think that	Well I thought because if you double the coordinates then I thought maybe it could be longer	4.0
So you said longer	Yeah	0.0
So the new trapezoid was going to be wider but wider Fletcher what did you say	Well I said its going to be wider because you multiply	4.0
Okay yes	Its two times the first the horizontal	3.0
X coordinate	Two times	3.0
By two	By two	0.0
By two	And that makes them go farther and longer	4.0
Abigail	So the new trapezoid is still going to be as tall as it was because thats what	3.0
Same height	Yes	0.0
Yes	And its still going to be on the Y axis for four and then its going to be longer on the X	3.0
So wider	X axis	3.0
Julian	By two	3.0
How would you say that	Because it says you double the first one but it would be longer because the first number is always going to be longer and youre doubling that so it would make it longer	4.0
Julian said it	By two	3.0
Landon	Double the width	3.0
Whats another way to say it	Wider by two times	3.0
Josh	I was going to say it could also be wider by five squares because thats what	4.0
I was going to say it could also be wider by five squares because thats what	It never got farther than five because when you got here if you didnt draw anything it only got to the five area and thats how far it got	4.0
It never got farther than five because when you got here if you didnt draw anything it only got to the five area and thats how far it got	So then it could be farther by five because its five times	4.0
Landon	I thought of the rule that goes horizontal vertical and then I estimated that it would be longer because you double the X axis which always comes first	4.0
I thought of the rule that goes horizontal vertical and then I estimated that it would be longer because you double the X axis which always comes first	So youd go farther across and still go the same height	4.0
If we double the first coordinate here its going to be what Ariana	Two and four	3.0
Savannah	10 and four	3.0
And then if I double the first coordinate here whats it going to be Ally	10 zero	3.0
And whats the E coordinate	Zero and zero	3.0
By how much	By double	3.0
Double if I multiplied it by three	Oh by three	0.0
Elijah	We thought it would be way longer because it	3.0
What does long mean	Wider	3.0
It would be way wider if we changed the second coordinate	Oh the second	0.0
Ari	It would get taller	3.0
Taller mmhmm	Yeah	0.0
How much taller	Three times taller	3.0
Fletcher	Youd multiply the Y axis times two	3.0
So you followed the rule and what did you create	A new trapezoid	3.0
Abigail	Because the instructions told you that you need to multiply it by two	4.0
Abigail	You had to multiply the first coordinates by two	3.0
Yes	And then	0.0
Did you write it down	Yeah	0.0
Are you listening	Mmhmm	0.0
So this is your new problem	Thank you	0.0
You guys all should have your CER	Thank you	0.0
Whats up	Can I just	0.0
Oh Ethan	When it says to make it larger does it mean it as making it taller and wider or both	2.0
What is that number	904 and 8000	3.0
And then you add those up to get 909	Cool	0.0
Are you guys set	This is how I learned how to do it	0.0
This is how I learned how to do it	I never learned that way	1.0
So Mark is showing his math skills and hes going to do it with partial sums	I know what I did but not	0.0
So will you explain what you did here	So I added I first added both the ones place and I got six then I added the tens place and I got one and one tenth	4.0
So I added I first added both the ones place and I got six then I added the tens place and I got one and one tenth	Then I added the hundreds place and I got	4.0
Four hundreds plus five hundreds equals	Nine hundreds	3.0
Can you walk us through it	So I put the numbers vertically and I added four plus five is nine and eight plus three is eleven	4.0
Natalie	She had to do it that way so she could carry that one to make another one	4.0
Eli	So the reason she had to put that there was because it was eight plus three which would equal 11 which was more than 10	4.0
So the reason she had to put that there was because it was eight plus three which would equal 11 which was more than 10	So then she would put the 10 up there and then she would keep the one down there	4.0
Landon why dont you agree with me	I dont agree because the decimal	4.0
Come point to what youre talking about	Dont point to what youre talking about	0.0
Dont point to what youre talking about	This number is in the correct place value but this one it needs to be moved over one spot because the decimals right here	4.0
This number is in the correct place value but this one it needs to be moved over one spot because the decimals right here	And it has to be over here	0.0
Why	Because this is a whole in the ones place	4.0
So when it says show your work I want to see your work	Are we allowed to work together	0.0
How did you figure out that its 58	I was going to do the denominator first so I did 2 x 4 which is 8	4.0
I was going to do the denominator first so I did 2 x 4 which is 8	And then I did 4 x 1 for the numerator and I did that for 48	4.0
And then I did 4 x 1 for the numerator and I did that for 48	And then I did 48  18 which equals 58	4.0
Did you find one	Yeah	0.0
Okay so our  for today is  will you read that for us please	Yeah	0.0
Whats a fraction	A fraction is like three fourths or one half	3.0
What makes those fractions different than a mixed number Cooper	Well a mixed number is kind of like  two or four halves or something	3.0
Well a mixed number is kind of like  two or four halves or something	Then that would be the fraction and the mixed number would be	3.0
So you gave me example and youre absolutely right but tell me in words how would you describe the difference	So the difference is a fraction is basically a number over a number and a mixed number is always at least one who number	3.0
So theres a whole number in a mixed number	And a fraction	3.0
So this would be a mixed number right	Mmhmm	0.0
No because why Anna	Because theyre not the same	4.0
Because they what	Because theyre not the same sized pieces	4.0
Joey	Theyre different denominators	3.0
So your success criteria today Landon is	I will know Im successful when I use  of fractions circle pieces to solve problems two point	0.0
Two through five	Two through five on page 164	0.0
Isaac	Theyre both mixed numbers	3.0
How else	The denominators are the same	3.0
Landon	So on number one you just have to subtract the numbers	3.0
So on number one you just have to subtract the numbers	Theres no  need to do	3.0
So then tell me about this one	So the	0.0
So the	The three is bigger than the one on the bottom number but the one third is smaller than twothirds	4.0
The three is bigger than the one on the bottom number but the one third is smaller than twothirds	So what I did  three and carried a one over to the one third you make it four thirds	4.0
So what I did  three and carried a one over to the one third you make it four thirds	Then I could subtract two thirds from four thirds to get two thirds again	4.0
How would you  do an estimate Anna	You just use	0.0
What would you think	Three fourths is  whole	3.0
Uhhuh	And one third is  to zero	3.0
Uhhuh	one minus zero equals one	4.0
So for problem for Joey what would you do	I think I would multiply the denominators together to see what the common denominator is	3.0
So number four we have three fourths minus one third	Yes	0.0
quick denominator  to find that	Three times four	3.0
Three times four equals		3.0
Were going to multiply three fourths by what	Three thirds	3.0
We get nine twelfths and here were going to multiply one third by what	Four fourths	3.0
So what would the answer to that one be Logan	The answer to that one  five twelfths	3.0
What denominator would be used	I would probably use	0.0
I would probably use	I would probably take a whole from	3.0
So what do you need to do first in order to have Get this ready to subtract	four fourths	3.0
A whole from three and youd make this into	Four thirds	3.0
You can	Yeah	0.0
What do we need to do with the fractions in order to subtract this Aiden	What you should do is we should do three times two  denominators to equal six	4.0
So then what	You multiply the one by	3.0
The one half Logan	What you got to do to make the half into a sixth is you got to multiply three times three over three	4.0
Are we good	Okay	0.0
So can we subtract it now	Yes because theyre common denominators	4.0
Do you know what the next step is	You get rid of one of the threes	3.0
Okay	Then you add it over to the denominator	3.0
quick common denominator Anna	quick common denominator  five times three	3.0
A fifth of that	I thought that you find one fifth and then multiply it by	3.0
Is it gonna be more or less than what you start with	So its saying	0.0
Fifteen times one fifth	Oh okay	0.0
So what is one fifth of 15	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
I want you to talk with your shoulder partner today	So all the answers arent the same because	3.0
So all the answers arent the same because	So do the fractions	3.0
So do the fractions	The fractions like the dividing part	1.0
The fractions like the dividing part	Yeah you would divide the number by five and then multiply it by one	4.0
Yeah you would divide the number by five and then multiply it by one	I multiply	1.0
I multiply	I dont even look at the one	1.0
Stand up when youre done	Five times six 30 seven 30	4.0
Five times six 30 seven 30	Oh wait no youre right	1.0
Maddie	I did five times fifteen	3.0
Whatd you do	fraction of 15	3.0
fraction of 15	So and that was three times five and I know three times five equals 15	4.0
Bryson	Oh well I I realize On the first problem that its multiplied by one	4.0
Oh well I I realize On the first problem that its multiplied by one	So and if you multiply a like one times two thats still just two	4.0
So and if you multiply a like one times two thats still just two	So I thought of it more as a division problem	4.0
So you divided the invite	Yeah	0.0
Anna	I noticed that dividing by five is the same as	3.0
Bridger	In order to do division you need to do multiplication	3.0
In order to do division you need to do multiplication	Its kind of hard to explain	0.0
Zach	The way I think of the division basically all the time is like how many times can five fit in 35	3.0
Yeah	And I think it would just be seven so thats how I did it	3.0
So if one fifth is three then how many are three	Total three	3.0
Start with 20 divided by the one	Four	3.0
So youre taking this number times three then divided like that	Theyre gonna all be the same	3.0
Two times three is	Six	3.0
So 20 times three is	Six	3.0
Why does that give you three fifths of of the number	Because dividing three by five like when we learn gives them a fraction	4.0
Because dividing three by five like when we learn gives them a fraction	So so its basically the rule for number three but just kind of put in whole number for them	4.0
What have we talked about	So okay	0.0
So okay	So 13 divided by three times two	4.0
So 13 divided by three times two	So a third a fifth and times two	4.0
Whats another way you can think about it	This is what I do	0.0
This is what I do	I do	0.0
I do	I put 13 as a fraction 13 over one and add eight times two thirds	4.0
Plus two thirds how many two thirds do I need here	Two	3.0
Why is this not working for me	Are you clicking the button on the top	0.0
And whats our denominator	Three	3.0
Alec	Eight	3.0
And then how many leftover	Two	3.0
I want to make it into a fraction	Yeah	0.0
Two over whats the denominator	Three	3.0
Questions	Were working in partnerships or on our own	0.0
Figure out figure out what the difference is	because you did everything	0.0
because you did everything	Youre finding two thirds of two thirds	3.0
Youre finding two thirds of two thirds	I did	1.0

Two thirds so that means there needs to be how many parts	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
So the instructions are fold and shade a piece of paper so youre folding and shading	I know	0.0
I know	I know two thirds	0.0
I know two thirds	fourth ninths	3.0
fourth ninths	Is it four ninths	3.0
Is this your pencil	Whose pencil is this	0.0
Whose pencil is this	I found it in my desk	0.0
Im sorry	is this your pencil	0.0
is this your pencil	No	0.0
No	No	0.0
No	We have no	0.0

This is my pencil	This is not my pencil	0.0
So did anybody get the answer	They dont know	0.0
They dont know	four sixes	3.0
four sixes	Its four tenths	1.0
Its four tenths	Its four tenths	1.0
Its four tenths	Its four tenths	1.0
Its four tenths	Its	0.0
Anna what did you get	Four ninths	3.0
Two thirds of two thirds is four ninths and tell me what you did to get that	Well I multiplied four and	3.0
You multiplied	Yeah	0.0
Okay	And I  and then with the denominator I put 33 again	3.0
So did you do the folding part	Yes	0.0
So first you folded counting right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
So the first step Landon would be what	So folding it into thirds	3.0
So we fold that way into thirds and we want two thirds of two thirds so what am I going to shade here	Two in thirds	3.0
What am I going to shade	Two thirds of it	3.0
Two out of the three parts	Mmhmm	0.0
Yall see that	Yeah	0.0
So what is the whole	two thirds	3.0
The whole is two thirds	Three thirds	3.0
Three thirds	I said three thirds	1.0
So then what did you do after that Joey	I did it to the side	3.0
You pulled it into the other direction	Yeah	0.0
And then what did you do after that to find two thirds of two thirds	I shaded	3.0
So it would be this and this	Yes	0.0
Should we	I dont have it	2.0
Am I right	Mmhmm	0.0
How many parts to	One	3.0
Talk to your partners	multiply it but I think its	3.0
Or is the product greater or less than the factors	Its greater	3.0
Its greater than	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Two thirds or four ninths	Two thirds	3.0
Why does it makes sense that two thirds of two thirds would be less than two thirds	I know how to solve it	0.0
Are you guys ready	Yeah	0.0
Why does it make sense that the product of two thirds of two thirds would be less than the factor of two thirds	Because the area	0.0
Caleb	I think	0.0
I think	I thought four ninths was smaller than two thirds because for two thirds to get a whole its just one more one third away from getting one whole	4.0
I thought four ninths was smaller than two thirds because for two thirds to get a whole its just one more one third away from getting one whole	And then four ninths would 608 we know	4.0
And then four ninths would 608 we know	Wait hang on 508	4.0
Kevin	I agree with Caleb because one third and now also youre doubling a numerator so that is four thirds then also you have triple the denominator so that might be why you are	4.0
Why the product is smaller	Yeah	0.0
Kevin do you have a different explanation	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So paper to show	0.0
Stand in front	Okay	0.0
Okay	this is two thirds as a whole and two thirds of this so I can and this is a whole and then I take two thirds of that	4.0
this is two thirds as a whole and two thirds of this so I can and this is a whole and then I take two thirds of that	Its two thirds of two thirds	4.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Landon do you have something to ask him	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Can I go up and show	0.0
And so when you listen to others short of making you repeat it I could make you repeat it but I think if you really pay attention and make sure you understand what theyre saying then you will be able to explain it as well	So the answer if four ninths which is this but we have the thirds so the two thirds goes all the way down here and then the other two thirds goes out here	4.0
So the answer if four ninths which is this but we have the thirds so the two thirds goes all the way down here and then the other two thirds goes out here	It goes out onto the thirds two thirds	4.0
It goes out onto the thirds two thirds	So theyre bigger than each other	4.0
So theyre bigger than each other	Well not bigger the two thirds extends out more than our answer each way	4.0
Well not bigger the two thirds extends out more than our answer each way	It extends out four ninths more	4.0
Mmhmm	And then plus if that one the answer here this one goes out here and then this one goes out here	4.0
Mmhmm	So its four ninths larger than our answer	4.0
So its four ninths larger than our answer	Because its the two thirds	4.0
Because its the two thirds	Its hard to explain	0.0
So the point is what is included in each of the two thirds	Mmhmm	0.0
Liam or Im sorry Hunter did you have another explanation	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	explanation is	0.0
explanation is	Even though were multiplying its still thinking only being on	3.0
Exactly	But say you have 10  you have 10 ones if you would take one over two of that then youd get five 15 because youre getting only a fraction of	4.0
But say you have 10  you have 10 ones if you would take one over two of that then youd get five 15 because youre getting only a fraction of	So even if its and youre getting only two thirds of that because its not all in the two thirds	4.0
So the dimensions would be how long each side is	Three by three	3.0
Three by three	Mmhmm	0.0
Huh	One	3.0
If we know that our equals like the area of the large square	Nine	3.0
I think its one because one times one equals what	I think its one because length times width	4.0
I think its one because length times width	Then look one two three four five six seven eight nine	4.0
Then look one two three four five six seven eight nine	And because you go down to three three three three three it comes back	4.0
And because you go down to three three three three three it comes back	Three six nine	4.0
Three six nine	Three times three is nine	4.0
Three times three is nine	Three six nine one two three four five six three ways to show it	4.0
Three six nine one two three four five six three ways to show it	Three six seven eight	4.0
Is one unit and what is the width	One	3.0
Why do you have to talk to me that way Colin	I just said one	3.0
What	I just said	0.0
Matt	Me and Jace thought that the area was nine	1.0
Nine	Wait no	3.0
Mia	The area is one	3.0
And how do you know	Because one times one is one	4.0
Is everybody with me	Yep	0.0
Joey	Its two by two	3.0
Two by two	Yeah	0.0
This whole thing is one	Thats	0.0
This whole length of the line is what	Two thirds of it	3.0
Did you guys all write that down	Yep	0.0
So multiplication for the area of the shaded rectangle would be what	Basically nothing	0.0
Peyton	Probably two thirds times two thirds	3.0
So there are one two three four so what fraction does each of these represent	Fourths	3.0
And what would this be	One fourth	3.0
One fourth	Two fourths	3.0
Two fourths	Three fourths	3.0
Three fourths	A whole	3.0
So whats the length of this side	One	3.0
So the dimensions would be one fourth by what did you say	Two fourths	3.0
So then whats the area	Three 16ths	3.0
Because there are how many pieces total	16	3.0
16 so those are 16ths	And then	0.0
And then one fourth times three fourths	Is	0.0
So the multiplication numbers  so this would be one fourth times	Three fourths	3.0
Three fourths	Equals	0.0
All right and for your math classes today	Thank you	0.0
Youre welcome	Thank you	0.0
Hey you guys if youre going to work on the whiteboard can you put this so they can hear what youre saying	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	0.0
So on the horizontal axis everybody say horizontal axis	Horizontal axis	0.0
Anna	Six twelfths	3.0
And the denominator is what did you say		3.0
Why is it 12	Because theres 12 sections	4.0
So what is it	One third	3.0
Did your grandma make that  for you	Mmhmm	0.0
You got what	Three fifteenths	3.0
Matt whats the answer to this problem	Three fifteenths	3.0
Joey	The blocks that are shaded	3.0
Okay so the shaded	Double shaded	3.0
Cooper	If you do three fifths and then one third across then three of those fifths would equal three I guess	4.0
If you do three fifths and then one third across then three of those fifths would equal three I guess	So you double shade a third but also youre shading a part where three fifths were shaded	4.0
Isaac	It represents the	0.0
I couldnt hear	It represents the  It represents the bottom	3.0
It represents the  It represents the bottom	How many squares are on the bottom	3.0
How many	Parts	3.0
How many parts it takes to	Fill the square	3.0
Still waiting	Well it is the area	3.0
Well it is the area	There is 15 squares inside the one square	3.0
So what does the 15 represent	The 15 represents how many squares there are to make a whole	3.0
Anna		3.0
How do you know	Six times five	4.0
Joey	Because five times six is 30	4.0
Because five times six is 30	With the area when you draw six lines and five lines thats basically five times six	4.0
You can draw it if you want	Its so hard to explain	0.0
Really loudly	The reason why is because basically showing it on an area model if you count up the parts theres 30 obviously	4.0
The reason why is because basically showing it on an area model if you count up the parts theres 30 obviously	And then you will only shade in 10	4.0
And then you will only shade in 10	And then you can prove it on an area model	4.0
And then you can prove it on an area model	Even though we know its going to be 10 we can find it on an area model by shading in	4.0
The five sixths one way and the two fifths the other way	Mmhmm	0.0
You want to try it	Kind of explain what the answer of the five sixths	0.0
Why 10 would be the numerator	Because youre kind of Basically what youre doing is youre just multiplying the denominator by the denominator and the numerator by the numerator	4.0
Because youre kind of Basically what youre doing is youre just multiplying the denominator by the denominator and the numerator by the numerator	And you also know that because lets say you shade five sixths on the square thing and then five halves	4.0
Two fifths	Two fifths I mean	0.0
Two fifths I mean	Then youll just have 30 as your answer	3.0
Then youll just have 30 as your answer	And the remainder Not the remainder	3.0
No youd have 30 total squares but	Thered be 10 squares total in the whole entire rectangle	3.0
So the 10 would be shaded if you did the area model and thats really all it is	So youre just basically multiplying	3.0
Aiden	Fifteenths	3.0
And then whats the numerator	Eight	3.0
And how do you know	Because four times two is eight	4.0
Yep	We need to pass	0.0
What	We need to pass	0.0
Oh yeah	pass out  please	0.0
Okay so  intention please	look at other students work to see whether  in the same way I did to solve the problem	0.0
what was the third part of what you needed to do	casserole that group B took	3.0
What did you notice about the picture	What I noticed is that it kind of highlighted not highlighted but	3.0
You can  do you want to come and point at it	Sure	0.0
Anybody else want to share	I noticed that so	0.0
Come on up you can come point at it too	So what I noticed is  equal parts and	3.0
Uhhuh	What I noticed is they said its threefourths of what they took but theres the denominator should be 12	4.0
What I noticed is they said its threefourths of what they took but theres the denominator should be 12	So what I think they were thinking is breaking it into these rows so thats three but then they must have thought that the leftover would be the denominator	4.0
So what I think they were thinking is breaking it into these rows so thats three but then they must have thought that the leftover would be the denominator	So thats what I thought they were thinking	4.0
Thank you Carson	Maybe the whole row of the pencils	4.0
Maybe the whole row of the pencils	So I think they thought each one of them would be its own	4.0
So I think they thought each one of them would be its own	So they thought this was fourths because it split into fourths	4.0
So they thought this was fourths because it split into fourths	And they thought only one of them would be threefourths  said it was  twelfths but I think they messed up	4.0
And they thought only one of them would be threefourths  said it was  twelfths but I think they messed up	They thought this was just the whole part	4.0
They thought this was just the whole part	But this was actually the whole but they thought this row was the whole thing	4.0
Thank you	I think  threefourths which could have been  but its right in front of  that theres 12 pieces and it could have been	3.0
Okay	And they said  casserole	3.0
what do you think	What I think is that it could be focusing on just the group	3.0
Why would they just focus on that group	Because it says	0.0
Why would they just focus on this row	Because it says how much  instead of	4.0
Why would they just be focused on the first row Logan	I think if you focus on the first row	0.0
Listen up	because  you dont need to worry about group A	4.0
because  you dont need to worry about group A	You just need to worry about group B because its easier	4.0
Why	Because thats what were trying to  how much group B took	4.0
Because thats what were trying to  how much group B took	to disagree	1.0
Okay keep going  come on up	to the other one because I was  question and they put this in number two	4.0
to the other one because I was  question and they put this in number two	And it says in the instructions the amount of the whole casserole	4.0
And it says in the instructions the amount of the whole casserole	So the entire casserole means group A is portion two	4.0
do you want me to switch to the other picture or this one	it says that the whole casserole that group B took	3.0
it says that the whole casserole that group B took	The amount of the whole casserole that group B took	3.0
Were just making sense of this picture and why would they use  Why would they have this threefourths here for	It says the whole casserole which means all of it	4.0
It says the whole casserole which means all of it	So this is the instruction thats the whole casserole	4.0
So this is the instruction thats the whole casserole	Then you find out how much that group B took out of that	4.0
So how much group B took	So they did take these three but the only problem is their denominator right there	1.0
Okay	Thats what were trying to understand	1.0
Carson	I think I know why they put the fourths	1.0
Okay come show me	I think they got confused because	1.0
Oh you think they messed up	Yeah I think they got confused because on the description of the problem it said that group A took all of that	4.0
Yeah I think they got confused because on the description of the problem it said that group A took all of that	So they probably just thought it was  and they could forget about it	4.0
So group A took this	And it came	0.0
This is gone	So I think they can just forget about it and take it out of the problem and then they had four pieces left	4.0
So I think they can just forget about it and take it out of the problem and then they had four pieces left	So I think thats why they have fourths	4.0
Does that make sense why they would have threefourths	Yes	1.0
So then what this threetwelfths represents can you keep running with that Carson	I think  represents all of it	3.0
I think  represents all of it	They model  just that	3.0
They model  just that	This doesnt connect with this	3.0
This doesnt connect with this	This they had the right answer and then this they went and forgot about this	1.0
What is wrong with it	I noticed that	0.0
Do you like this picture	Yeah	1.0
So that clearly shows that what they ate was  did you agree with the number sentence that they used	No its	0.0
What dont you like about it	The denominator	1.0
The denominator you dont like the denominator	subtract  from the denominator	1.0
So Logan do you have something	Yes why would you choose subtraction when you have addition and multiplication	2.0
What do you think Anna	I dont think subtraction correlates with  used for multiplying two fractions together	1.0
Okay	I respectfully disagree	2.0
Okay what do you think Carson	I do agree that the number problem is incorrect but I think that the subtraction factor is correct because this is what I did	1.0
Do you want to tell them what your	My difference is that they subtracted the leftover to get the	1.0
What is the  representing	The  represents how much group A took	3.0
Oh okay	Group A took eight	3.0
Group A took eight	And then so	0.0
So we take away the	Yeah	0.0
Whats that last onetwelfth	That would be the leftover	3.0
Okay	But then you have those three	3.0
But then you have those three	But I think you should actually subtract those three too and have the one be your answer because thats the leftover so that would be the remainder of it	4.0
The question was how much	Oh yeah	0.0
Thank you	Okay yeah	0.0
what do you think	I kind of agree and disagree because I agree with what Tom said dont you have to subtract the denominator but also 12 minus eight minus onethird it doesnt equal three	4.0
Okay	It equals one	3.0
It equals one	So dont really see how that would equal threetwelfths	3.0
Oh	Yeah	0.0
12 minus eight is four minus one is three	Oh I thought	0.0
Oh I thought	Oh	0.0
Oh	I was thinking of 10	3.0
Anna what do you think	is that the  minus onetwelfth first and thats the sum of what everyone took all together	4.0
is that the  minus onetwelfth first and thats the sum of what everyone took all together	so if they did eleventwelfths minus eighttwelfths which is greatest	4.0
So is this the same as the others	No	1.0
The picture also does a really  Well what do you notice about the picture	So	0.0
Oh	And its	0.0
Theres four what	Theres fourfourths	3.0
What is the fourfourths what does that represent	A whole	3.0
Why	Because four times three equals 12	4.0
Because four times three equals 12	And threefourths right here	4.0
Threefourths	Up here its threefourths times onethird	3.0
What do you see Caleb	I know how they got the threefourth and onethird because the	3.0
Come show us	The length for it is  because its going three	4.0
The length for it is  because its going three	And then theres the width is four  times threefourths and you would get threetwelfths	4.0
So what does the onethird represent	The length of the	3.0
Carson do you know what the onethird represents	The onethird oh actually I do not	0.0
The onethird oh actually I do not	I was going to say that they use math strategy for their number	2.0
What was that	It was oh I forget the name but  really recently its where you get the	0.0
The area  for multiplying fractions	I think yeah	0.0
whats the one third represent	I think	0.0
I think you know	Its because right here  this way	0.0
So what are we left talking about	Fourths	3.0
This is zero this is onethird this is twothirds	Threethirds	3.0
And if were just talking about these pieces how many are there	Four	3.0
So were talking about	Threefourths	3.0
What	casserole	3.0
Of the	Casserole the entire thing	3.0
Theyre asking how much of the whole casserole did group B eat		3.0
Were on lesson 3 Will you read the learning intention	fractions of the problem	0.0
Mia will you read it please	I will know I am successful when I have learned to solve fraction problems	0.0

What is this number	Seventytwo million	3.0
Avery	The seventy had a zero so when you were writing six	3.0
Okay so when you have solved this please tell your partner about what you think the answer is and how you would explain that your answer is correct	I used my fraction circles to help me	3.0
I used my fraction circles to help me	This much	1.0
Sophia	Ella	3.0
Why do you think Ella ate more	Ella ate more because she ate a half of the baby carrots and Jackson only ate a third	4.0
Ella ate more because she ate a half of the baby carrots and Jackson only ate a third	So a half is way bigger than a third	4.0
Do you agree with that Isabella	Yes because a half is a fifth bigger than a third	4.0
Do you agree with Cooper	I respectfully disagree because Ella had 22 baby carrots and Jackson had 36 and half of 22 is 11 and one third of 36 is 12	4.0
I respectfully disagree because Ella had 22 baby carrots and Jackson had 36 and half of 22 is 11 and one third of 36 is 12	Because 12 plus 12 is 24 plus another 12 is 36	4.0
Because 12 plus 12 is 24 plus another 12 is 36	So I think Jackson ate more carrots	4.0
What do you think Landon	I agree with Cooper because Jacksons whole would be bigger because he has more carrots so thats what I think	4.0
I agree with Cooper because Jacksons whole would be bigger because he has more carrots so thats what I think	And Ella only has 22	4.0
And Ella only has 22	He has 36	4.0
Are you listening	I also agree	1.0
I also agree	Because I divided it by half 22	4.0
You divided what	I divided 22 in half	3.0
Because Ella ate 22	And then I divided 36 by 3 and that was 12	4.0
And then I divided 36 by 3 and that was 12	He ate 12 carrots and Ella ate 11 carrots	4.0
It didnt like me doing that turning it on and then turning it off	Yeah it follows you around	0.0
Yeah it follows you around	It follows the necklace	0.0

I want to see and you might want to write this down as Im saying it numerator denominator quotient dividend	Wait why quotient	2.0
What about mixed number	cards have to	0.0
Okay	Do we need to take the 2020 Math Constructed Responses	0.0
Hunter	When it says every other tenth and one it adds a zero every time to the decimal	3.0
Noah	I chose two different ways of expanded form for the number three and four 82 thousandths	3.0
What does expanded form mean Connor	If you were to do 1200 you would get 1000 200	4.0
Quinn	If you have a shorter number you can make it longer	3.0
Mason	One	0.0
One	I dont really know	2.0
WilNoah	317 and 29 hundredths	3.0
What place value is the number underlined in	I think thats turning when you move	0.0
Asher	Number one I think its in the tenths place	3.0
Number two Mason	Maybe hundredths	3.0
This is just a quick review because youre taking just a few seconds and then well flip it over	Do we write the place its in or the place of value	0.0
The place on the place value chart its in	The value of it	0.0
Number one Kate	is the hundredths place	3.0
Number two Ariana	Thousandths	3.0
34	Hundredths	3.0
Natalie	34 thousandths hundredths	3.0
Hundredths or 248 class	Thousandths	3.0
Mason	Im pretty sure its 34	3.0
Okay 34 what	34 hundredths	3.0
How do you know	Because yes its a smaller number but its a bigger thing	4.0
Because yes its a smaller number but its a bigger thing	Like 200	4.0
Like 200	Id rather have 248	4.0
Id rather have 248	Id rather have 34 of a hundred things than 248 of a thousand things	4.0
Okay	Because theyre going to be bigger pieces	4.0
Kate	I agree with Mason that its 34 hundredths	1.0
Hudson	All ready	0.0
So Id write that out as Did anyone write it as a greater than or less than	Yes	0.0
Does anyone know how many this has on it	No	0.0
Sophie	But those are rectangles	3.0
Yep a thousand rectangles	Actually a hundred squares	3.0
So it would have gotten two one two three four and then	Eight	3.0
What place value Kate	Tenths	3.0
How do you know the tenths place Natalie	Three is closer to a whole than two	3.0
Addie	24 hundredths	3.0
Two what Hunter	Tenths	3.0
So now what Skyler four what	Squares	3.0
I think were about ready to play top it	Top it	0.0
Top it	I love top it	0.0
I would call her in the whole thing and then Id have to draw another one	Two rows and five squares	3.0
Tyler would you like to come color it in	Yes	0.0
Okay see if you agree with how Tyler colors it in	Two and then five squares	3.0
Thanks Nate	I disagree	1.0
Comments	I disagree with him	1.0
That one was tough youll see	I respectfully disagree	1.0
He didnt have to this could have been like this	Actually I got a little bit confused	2.0
Actually I got a little bit confused	I thought the 18 was all in the tiny little square boxes	0.0
Well honestly you could look at it as it is an eighth 18	Yeah I got confused	2.0
Did we do the last one	Yes we did yellow	0.0
You have five tenths eight hundredths and four	Can we do one more please	0.0
You want to try	I do I want to try	0.0
Brendan	I meant which ones greater	2.0
Oh which ones greater	600	3.0
I think weve done it before	Yes we did it in class	0.0
Okay then lets start on page 121	Hello	0.0
Now were going to read it together in three two one	I will round	0.0
Were going to read this one together in three two one go	I will round decimals up and down using a number line grid or rounding shortcuts	0.0
And we will know were successful in three two one go	I will know Im successfully when I can round decimals up or down using a number grid or rounding shortcuts on journal page 125	0.0
Does that sounds familiar	Yes it does from last year	0.0
Yeah from last year	What if its at five	2.0
Noah	You round up	3.0
Why	Because the other digit would be greater than zero	4.0
Why else do think we would round up at five	No the digit after five it might be greater than zero if there were a digit	3.0
No the digit after five it might be greater than zero if there were a digit	Plus thats just the rule	3.0
Hudson	Four or less let it rest five or more raise the score	3.0
If you would like you can get out a colored pencil so you can use it when comes to shading	What page	0.0
Quinns ready Kate is ready Tyler is ready Abbys ready Peytons ready Masons ready	123	0.0
Miles	2800	3.0
Is 28 hundredths	Hundredths	0.0
You and your partners one and two and then well talk together	Okay	0.0
Nolan	Three tenths	3.0
How do you know	Because its more than 5 or greater than five	4.0
What part of 28 hundredths is greater than five	Um	0.0
Do you want to call on someone else to help	The eight	3.0
That eight what	The eight hundredths	3.0
Whats next	Its not	0.0
Its not	It says label the number in the lower	0.0
Two thats what I meant to do	Actually it would be	0.0
Actually it would be	Wait no thats right	0.0
25 hundredths mark	Five isnt the fifth digit Its actually the sixth	0.0
Agree	Yeah	0.0
It wouldnt make sense to say its closer to two tenths after that reasoning would it	No	0.0
So once you and your partner are done with four five and six you and your partner raise your hand and I will come by and check	Awesome	0.0
Sound good	Mmhmm	0.0
This is a really weird way to put it 3 and 619 thousandths cent	619 cents	0.0
So how much is the gas going to cost them Eli	3 and 3 and	3.0
So we need to look at the nine	Oh crap	0.0
Oh crap	Yeah that fits more of the up to the nearest hundredth	4.0
Yeah that fits more of the up to the nearest hundredth	So that 500 would go to two	4.0
So if the one becomes a two thatd be 3 and 60	Cents	3.0
Not 60 cents	I dont know	2.0
Okay work on those next problems with your partner	Okay	0.0
Mason	Let it rest	3.0
Let it rest	No I think actually you should raise it because	3.0
So are we closer to filling in this square or are we closer to this yellow square	Yellow square	3.0
Are you closer to filling in this whole square	Yeah	0.0
Are you closer to this yellow square Lilian	Closer to the one in the thousandths square	3.0
Laura	I think that it would be 363	3.0
Kate	My halfway number is three and 618 thousandths	3.0
Do you have something to add Noah	No	0.0
Everyone have that so far	Yes	0.0
Whats our halfway mark	Three and six fifteenths	3.0

One	Three	1.0
I said you must what	Follow along	0.0
Follow along	Follow along	0.0
Mason	Three times	3.0
Three times	I think that the remainder would be a third	3.0
Because three times three is what	Nine	3.0
Nine	And then the remainder would be one third because the remainder would be one but then we convert it into a fraction	4.0
What could I have 10 of	Potatoes	3.0

You do	Yeah you have to	0.0
Im just going to call it a T	T whenever I code we did the x position then the y position	0.0
Yep so this is the x and then this is the y	X and Y	0.0
Then this is our T	Why is	0.0
No this one is M	Including the x and y values go to triple digits	0.0
Including the x and y values go to triple digits	Yeah the reason you have to use that coding is so you can determine where your spread is going to be	0.0
Were going to label this one N	So you basically finding number Two numbers that youre calculating and then give them letters	3.0
One two three	I can play hidden treasures to practice plotting points on a coordinate grid	0.0

At first I was just trying to go across but I dont know where the sidewalk is	Should that just be on the side	0.0
Just the lines	Oh okay then  10	3.0
Laura	I think that it could be seven	3.0
Mason	I respectfully disagree with Leo and Laura	1.0
I respectfully disagree with Leo and Laura	I believe the shortest amount is 11 because you can go from the school to the grocery store in 11 blocks	4.0
I believe the shortest amount is 11 because you can go from the school to the grocery store in 11 blocks	You can go up here and then around here to the grocery store	4.0
Correct	Thats not how I measured	3.0
Did you take a different route	Yeah I did too	1.0

Thank you	Two and then 10	3.0
Nate	The pizzeria is at	0.0
The pizzeria is at	I respectfully disagree	1.0
I respectfully disagree	I respectfully disagree	1.0
How many blocks away did we say the park entrance was from the pizzeria	10	3.0
Is there a way we could find the blocks away the pizzeria is from the park entrance using the ordered pairs	Yes	0.0
Yes	I know	0.0
I know	I know	0.0
I know	Yes	0.0
Brendan	I think the bottom part of the Yaxis and you can find it out by since we know the one pair is at  at two you can go all the way to 10	4.0
I think the bottom part of the Yaxis and you can find it out by since we know the one pair is at  at two you can go all the way to 10	You can count how many that was from 10	4.0
Mason	I agree with Brendan but another way of saying it is the Yaxis is how far its going to be	1.0
Where is the ice cream shop	The ice cream shop is by the lake	0.0
The ice cream shop is by the lake	Go up Miss	3.0
Up	Its up there	3.0
We have the library ice cream shop	Thats far	0.0
Go	Okay	0.0
Okay	I think you start and go through the fire department	4.0
I think you start and go through the fire department	Lines go through the fire department and then this goes up	4.0
What is the ordered pair for the library	I know	0.0
Leo	23	3.0
Brendan	To the library	0.0
Mmhmm	Its  and then for the ice cream shop its	0.0
Its  and then for the ice cream shop its	I respectfully disagree	1.0
What about ice cream shop	I know	0.0
How many blocks away is the library from the ice cream shop	I know	0.0
You did a different route	Its the same number though	3.0
Its the same number though	I got 24	3.0
Explain	If we go from the library to the shoe store I got six and then we got three more that we go up so I have nine that way	4.0
If we go from the library to the shoe store I got six and then we got three more that we go up so I have nine that way	Then we go up and go up 10 more and I got 19	4.0
Then we go up and go up 10 more and I got 19	Then I did 19 plus five to the ice cream truck and I got 24	4.0
Miles	I think its 22	3.0
Okay	I counted once we get to the shoe store its seven	3.0
Mmhmm	Once we get to the gas station we have about 10	4.0
Once we get to the gas station we have about 10	To the pizzeria we have about 15 and then once we finally are at 15 and we count the rest of the squares I say you get 22	4.0
You say its 22	I respectfully disagree with you Miles	1.0
I respectfully disagree with you Miles	I disagree with you	1.0
22 blocks	It says its a city block if you do it at the bottom	0.0

Class	Origin	3.0
Tyler	14 blocks	3.0
Mason	Since we start at the origin we can go on the sides	4.0
Just a whiteboard marker	I also figured out something that we could	0.0
Now its six away so just like our city blocks our treasure is six blocks or six	Is this right Miss Koski	0.0
It could be here	Can you go diagonal in this	0.0
would be here	Thats eight blocks away	3.0
One two three four five six	Thats	0.0
Thats	That would be	0.0
That makes sense	Its eight blocks away	3.0
One no thats	Thats eight blocks away	3.0
Should we try	No	0.0
No	Its eight blocks away	3.0
Its eight blocks away	No	1.0
No	Its eight blocks away	3.0
Its eight blocks away	Im telling you	0.0
Get out your computer and you can play Hidden Treasure	Thank you Miss Koski	0.0
So youre not solving youre finding closest to which benchmark fraction	You estimate it	3.0
Chase	I think that it would be one the reason I think this is because threefifths is already at the halfway point and if you add any more even just onefourth it gets closer to a whole	4.0
We have seveneights which is already close to what	One whole	3.0
Kate	Zero	3.0
Macaroni and cheese	Everybody agrees	0.0
Brendan	Perhaps a two	3.0
Why do you think its two	Because it goes kind of close to two	4.0
Should we call on someone to help you explain	Im pretty sure because threeeighths and twothirds is already really close to one and if you add any more its going to be one and then one plus one would be two	4.0
Does that sound right	Yeah	0.0
Trey	I think its closer to one and a half	3.0
Okay why	I actually think it is closest to one because threefourths its closest to but if you minus that big number to a lower one it will be closest to one and a half	4.0
I actually think it is closest to one because threefourths its closest to but if you minus that big number to a lower one it will be closest to one and a half	It will actually be closest to one	1.0
It will actually be closest to one	its exactly one and a half	1.0
Noah	So if you rounded it would be closest to one but actually its closest to onehalf	3.0
So if you rounded it would be closest to one but actually its closest to onehalf	Yeah because threefourths is in the center and youre subtracting	4.0
Hunter	I think it going to be closest to zero because twoones isnt going to be two	4.0
Three two one	I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points to form pictures and applying rules to ordered pairs	0.0

Whats next Ariana	51	3.0
Now what do we need to do to our two dots before we go any further	Connect	3.0
Whats next Mason	57	3.0
Next	12	3.0
12	Miss it says 51 again	3.0
Miss it says 51 again	Or maybe a new number	3.0
Kate	I dont know	2.0
They want us to connect they want us to connect back to this ordered pair	So you could make the sail place	0.0
Now my straight edge is right there and I would have to delete my sailboat from where I have it right now	Wheres your straight edge	0.0
01	Does that mean	0.0
Ariana	20	3.0
So it wants us to go 20	That would be on a bottom line it would be on the X axis	3.0
70	Connecting back to 81	3.0
Connecting back to 81	It makes more sense now	0.0
Natalie	Double each number of the original pair	3.0
Hunter	Double it just says  just eight times two and then one times two	3.0

To the left	It starts out on the right side	4.0
It starts out on the right side	And doubling it would make it go this way	4.0

Lets look at the first part	Wait so this is an actual student	0.0
Uhhuh	In our class right now	0.0
So they said the X coordinate by six the folder will be taller	I dont see the misconception	0.0
I dont see the misconception	I might see it	0.0
I might see it	I see it	0.0
So they said	Oh they multiply both parts	3.0
So they said theyre going to multiply the X coordinate by six	They multiplied both by six	3.0
Only one that you cant see and they have 12 0	Are these students actually in the class	0.0
No	Wait didnt you write about something that he may have said like earlier	0.0
Hudson	That it should be wider not taller and filled by 2 both the yaxis and xaxis which makes it zero	4.0
Agree	Yes I agree	1.0
Okay	Wait why is the one so small and the other ones like	2.0
Wait why is the one so small and the other ones like	Maybe timesed it by two instead of by three or maybe	1.0

Okay for number 1 what was For number 1  what was the common denominator		3.0
Agree	Yeah	1.0
So  before the answer so what did we need to multiply 12 to get 8	Yes	0.0
12 multiply 4 equals	No	0.0
No	48	3.0
Add	Or add	0.0
What was the common denominator	The common denominator was 20	3.0

Yes	Because 5 x 4 is 20	4.0
Because 5 x 4 is 20	Another way of doing is problem is times those	3.0
Who noticed that	Me	0.0
Okay so 4 x 4 is		3.0
Im done	No	0.0
What do I do	You need to add	3.0
You need to add	2 times	3.0

Okay what is our common denominator		3.0
Our common denominator is 12 and then I grab my 12 pieces and  112 212	Wait wait wait	0.0
Im seeing how many  so 14  13	Thats just a half	3.0
Okay when you figure out how many 12s  14  13 gives me a thumbs up	I dont even know	2.0
How many 12s goes into 13  14	That many	3.0
Agree	Agree	1.0
So our answer is 712	differently	0.0
Okay	So first I put 312 on a 14 and I know that 24 can fit in so theres 14 by the  thats 14 then I can fit one more 14 on top but  one more  left over  and then put another 14 by it knowing that one does also have 312	4.0
Okay	And then there was one space left over	3.0
And then there was one space left over	Thats how I got my answer	3.0
Can you do what we did with 12  14	So 12  14	0.0
Who has the answer	Not me	0.0

Classetyclass	Yessetyyes	0.0
Whats the rule for number two Nate	The rule	0.0
The rule was what	The rule is divide by five	3.0
Five so what was 15 class	Three	3.0
Next	Four	3.0
Four	Seven	1.0
Seven	Two	1.0
What do you notice Skyler	I notice that theyre the exact same answers but theyre different problems	3.0
Classetyclass	Yessetyyes	0.0
What did you notice about one and two Nolan	I noticed that theyre the same problem	3.0
What do you mean by that	Theyre the same rules	3.0
Theyre the same rules	Theres the multiplication	3.0
That says times one fifth and that says divided by five so that doesnt look like the same rule to me	You can do it the same way	3.0
What do you mean	You can divide it the other way	3.0
What do you mean	Either way 15 you can just take the denominator and divide it by that number	3.0
Hadley	If you do 15 times 15 the second is 51 so once you get that answer which is 155 then you just divide it 15 by five so its just a quicker way to do it	4.0
Theyre both division right	Yes	0.0
Mustve been this one	Maybe its on the same slide	0.0
Maybe its on the same slide	Weve got more	0.0
Starting there 15 times three is		3.0
Then we have it divided by five right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Next we have 20 over one which would be 20 times three is		3.0
Then 60 divided by five is		3.0
35 times three divided by five		3.0
30 divided by five	Six	3.0
Its the same	Yeah it is	3.0
Yeah it is	Oh	0.0
Its the same	Okay	0.0
Okay	Did you even notice that you can just multiply the last digits by three	3.0

Read the directions for number five	Are we doing it together	0.0
Were going to do it together	Okeydokey	0.0
Okeydokey	Both of us	0.0
All of us	Oh	0.0
Oh	T came up with  Oh	0.0
T came up with  Oh	Nate came up with a really good strategy for these problems	0.0
Good	Skip chance with the denominator	4.0
Skip chance with the denominator	For example for 15 and 15 we did five 10 15	4.0
For example for 15 and 15 we did five 10 15	We have to equal the N number to do that	4.0
We have to equal the N number to do that	15 is the N number and we had to count these numbers to get to it so our answer was 15 of 15 was three	4.0
I think thats a great strategy	I have trouble pronouncing things sometimes	0.0
First in your own words describe the two strategies you know for multiplying fractions by a whole number	We need to write the same thing or not	0.0
I need to move a bit more	By the numerator	3.0
Then multiply the answer by the numerator of the fraction	Hey T	0.0
Hey T	Hey T	0.0
Hey T	Do you want to know how I write my As	0.0
Do you want to know how I write my As	I make a big circle and then come up like a ponytail	0.0
Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction to start	Why would you multiply it by the numerator	2.0
Why would you multiply it by the numerator	Youre supposed to do it by the denominator	3.0
Multiply the whole number by the numerator so thats when we do	T I think youre making something up	3.0
T I think youre making something up	Its significant	3.0
Its significant	I dont know what youre doing	2.0
Thats when we do Dan thats when we do like this	Oh	0.0
You know what Im saying now	Yeah	0.0
Then divide	Then divide what	2.0
Your answer by the numerator	Thats not how me and Nate do it	3.0
Yes do A and B	T nothing equals 13	3.0
What	Nothing equals 13	3.0
Nothing equals 13	You have to divide 13 by three	3.0
Asher	Like three fourths	3.0
Quinn	The first one says one half of three the second one says one half of three fourths	3.0
The first one says one half of three the second one says one half of three fourths	And its not a whole number	3.0
Have we done a fraction of a fraction yet	No	0.0
See if you can solve number one and two	I think you just add three to it	3.0
Bom ba da bom bom	Bombom	0.0
Mason	I noticed that one half of three  one half of three over one	4.0
I noticed that one half of three  one half of three over one	And then multiply those together to get three halves	4.0
One half of three over one would be three over two which is then what	One and one half	3.0
Miles	Depends  Because its an odd number the three is you have to go all the way back to another number that would get it remotely close to three fourths which in my opinion would be	4.0
Did we have to find a common denominator when multiplying up here	No	0.0
Three times one	Three	3.0
Two times four	Eight	3.0
Whats our answer	Three eighths	3.0
Cooper	Because we cant  and you really cant split  so you just three times eight	4.0
Because we cant  and you really cant split  so you just three times eight	eight and half of six eighths would be three eighths	4.0

And it might be taller than that	And then I turned it this way and made thirds and colored in twothirds	4.0
And then I turned it this way and made thirds and colored in twothirds	And then I found the double shaded part and counted that up	4.0
And then I found the double shaded part and counted that up	It was four and  it has nine squares in it so its fourninths	4.0

Natalie	I would like to add on to Miles	1.0
I would like to add on to Miles	By doing the same number times the numerator and denominator it will make it equivalent as  because you did the same thing for both the numerator and denominator	4.0
Mmhmm  Kate	I also would like to add on	1.0
I also would like to add on	It  works because its like when youre simplifying a fraction you would divide it by a whole number and  and you divide it by that and simplify the fraction	4.0
It  works because its like when youre simplifying a fraction you would divide it by a whole number and  and you divide it by that and simplify the fraction	So the opposite of multiplying the fraction which would bea smaller fraction	4.0
So the opposite of multiplying the fraction which would bea smaller fraction	So instead of simplifying it youre making it a bigger fraction so its just the opposite	4.0

Do we think five times 12 is going to be greater than five	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
A half of five is greater than five	No	0.0
Okay Miles	It says to multiply	3.0
Uhhuh	It says a multiplication symbol then why are we not multiplying	2.0
We are  what is five times 12	Five times 12 so five seven and a half	4.0
Remember fraction of problems Miles	Kind of	0.0
And  you said you wanted half of those oranges thats this multiplication problem	Okay	0.0
Nolan	Because even though a half is going to be smaller than its going to be the same number it just adds to the whole even though it starts bigger	4.0
What do you think for B	For B I got that  five times two	3.0
Faith	Which one	0.0
Okay sit down	Your mic is turned off again	0.0
Brendan	I remember that	0.0
Yes	And I remembered something from the last problem	0.0
It becomes what Nolan	Smaller	3.0
What do you notice and whats your reasoning	So I noticed that the 54 so the five is more than four	4.0
So I noticed that the 54 so the five is more than four	So there was a six and four and I knew that that was more than five because six is more than five so	4.0
Wait you mean four is more than	Well so theres five and 54	4.0
Well so theres five and 54	And then theres 54 which is more than one so one plus five is six	4.0
And then theres 54 which is more than one so one plus five is six	Now reminding you that six is more than the five	4.0
Okay	So I knew that the 54 five and 54 is greater than 5	3.0
Hunter	I agree with Leah but I see it in a different way	1.0
I agree with Leah but I see it in a different way	I just say that since that one is greater than a whole  five parts is greater than a whole	4.0
I just say that since that one is greater than a whole  five parts is greater than a whole	Five times one normally would be five and there would still be 1 point left and it would be54 would be greater	4.0
So 54 is greater than what	One	3.0
Unlike five because a half is less than	Five	3.0
Less than	Our product is going to be	0.0
Less than you said it five	Yeah	0.0
What do we think Ben	I think that it is five times  86 and 87	3.0
Is greater	Mmhmm	0.0
Daniel	8687 is not equal to one so it wouldnt be five if you did it	4.0
Miles	I believe that the five would be greater because it is onethe other five times 8687 86 is still one lower than the whole total	4.0
This is barely less than one	But it still means that the five is higher	3.0
Eli	I have the answer to that one E	3.0
Yes Eli	I noticed that its times one so it would be equal	3.0
Miles do you  want to give it a go	Multiplication lost it	3.0

So basically youre just doing equivalent fractions	Wait what does that mean when it says use the fractions	2.0
What did you say	What does it mean by using the fractions for question B	2.0
So for question B youre using for example is you wrote 22 youre multiplying 45 times  22 to get an equivalent fraction	Oh so whatever you use there you have to times it by	3.0
Five over five yeah youre right	What numbers should we do if we finish this	0.0

Why	Because if you have	0.0
Megan	Its less than a whole	3.0
Harold	I think threefourths times one is greater than threefourths	3.0

Merrill	is twothirds of nine is basically whats happened there	3.0
is twothirds of nine is basically whats happened there	So we could figure out what nine divided by half equals what	3.0
So if we do nine times twothirds are we going to get a product that is greater than nine	No	0.0
Ollie	We wont get a bigger problem because its lower than one	4.0
Less than  will the product be greater than twothirds	Yes	0.0
Merrill	Because half of nine is  it should be higher than twothirds because nine is an odd number and because its not even that means that there will be another fraction added onto the nine	4.0
When we multiply nine times twothirds are we going to get a product thats less than one	Yes	0.0
Yes	Wait	0.0
Christina	Will be greater than twothirds because youre multiplying the numerator to the nine and that will give you 18	4.0

When we do the traditional I multiplied it	I put the numbers down and carried them	4.0
So you wrote it and then multiplied it	Yes	0.0
Okay Charlie how did you do it	Im looking at Celestes board and it looks a little different than mine because I just did 365 x 18 then I just went down and down and down and I got 840	4.0
Thats pretty interesting	Wait what	0.0

Okay	I did 5 x 8 40 carry the 4 and then I did 8 x 6 is 48	4.0
So then you did 8 x 6 is 48 okay	So then I dropped the 8 and then I put the 4 into the 3	4.0
I bet you did something different	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Youre missing one	1.0
Youre missing one	Youre missing one	1.0
Madison whats he missing	The 4 from the	3.0
If 8 x 6 is 48 you have to add on this 4	Okay never mind I did 52	3.0
Yes	And then I put	0.0
And then I put	Okay never mind	0.0
Okay never mind	I was thinking something different but thats what I did	3.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	And then I did 8 x 3 is 24 plus the five is 290	4.0
Yes	Well 2920	3.0
I noticed a lot of people and were actually going to go stepbystep through this again	I think by mistake I did	3.0
So that was us going there	And then you have to do the one	3.0
1 x 365 is 365	No wrong	3.0
Why is it wrong	You forgot the zero	3.0
Collete	Its not	3.0
Its not	When youre doing that method before you go down you always have to place the zero and then multiply	2.0
What am I multiplying by		3.0
So that place holder is zero is making that a 10 then we go 365 and then we add	Yes	0.0
Yes	I got it right	0.0
I got it right	I dont think I added	3.0
I dont think I added	Yes	0.0
Yes	I got it right	0.0
Camille	So when we were doing it  can we think of this to go up there	3.0
Say that again for me	Is the  supposed to go up	3.0

I have a question from once we all finish stuff like that	Can we do the board	0.0
Yes only do this first step right here	Okay	0.0
Celeste	So when youre multiplying  zero that becomes zero and then you have to add one so would you still put down the 1	4.0

Courtney	Oh okay Ill explain	0.0
Oh okay Ill explain	I almost forgot the zero so I put the zero down first and I got 4 x 6  24 so I wrote 4 and I put the two on top and 4 x 0  0 and you have to add the 2 which counts the 2 and 4	4.0
I almost forgot the zero so I put the zero down first and I got 4 x 6  24 so I wrote 4 and I put the two on top and 4 x 0  0 and you have to add the 2 which counts the 2 and 4	And I got 20 thousand	4.0

Derek	I dont get How did you get the 4	2.0
The 4	Because how I got it I got the 8 because the 4 is 0 is 0 but then you have that 2 up there from the 24 then you go times 2	4.0
So our first step Derek is to do 4 x 6	Really	0.0
4 x 6 is 24 so thats why the 4 goes here and the 2 goes up here	Oh wait wait wait	0.0
Oh wait wait wait	I meant the	0.0
Here	No the 4 x the 2	3.0
What is 4 x 0		3.0
What is 0  2		3.0
Thats why the 2 goes there	Oh I was doing	0.0
Youre having the 2 take the place of the 0	Like I was doing that before like 4 x 2 4 x 2	3.0

You have 30 seconds to share where you put B and what your reasoning is	I think B goes here because if B goes here its because	3.0
Charlie would you please share where you put B on your number line	I put it in between one and one half and two	3.0
Why did you do that	Because with the equation I just did one third plus one and three fourths and I got two and four thirds	4.0
Miller what do you think about Charlies answer	I disagree because its a ray over a half and it added like a two basically because three is bigger than one fourth so I added that	4.0
I disagree because its a ray over a half and it added like a two basically because three is bigger than one fourth so I added that	Not really I just	0.0
Not really I just	In my head	0.0
Frida what do you think about what they said	I agree more with Miller	1.0
I agree more with Miller	My answer was between two and two and a half so I got two and one fourths	4.0
Nolan	So what I got was	0.0
So what I got was	I got around two because one and three fourths is above one and one half plus the one third Thats kind of a big fraction so I got close to two	4.0
Hunter	I agree with Nolan	1.0
Okay tell me more	I agree with Nolan because I also got near two because we started off with one and three fourths which is greater than the half	4.0
Great	And we added one third so I got right by two	4.0
Lets do the Lets see what it tells us	I like this benchmark fraction thing	0.0

So Frankie will you please share your thinking with us	I put it kind of close to one and one half	3.0
I put it kind of close to one and one half	Yeah	0.0
Because	I put it there because I feel like seven eighths is kind of like a whole	4.0
I put it there because I feel like seven eighths is kind of like a whole	Really close to a whole	4.0
What did you Frankies answer	I slightly disagree with him but I get how he got his answer	1.0
Okay	So Im pretty sure that he probably got the right answer because I actually moved up the seven to an eight because I know that seven eighths	4.0
So Im pretty sure that he probably got the right answer because I actually moved up the seven to an eight because I know that seven eighths	Seven is close to eight and thats a whole	4.0
Seven is close to eight and thats a whole	And I also know that a half is half to a whole but then I also realized that its going to take one of the two away so thats how I got one and one half	4.0
What do you think about what Parker said reflecting on your answer	Im kind of thinking what youre thinking Parker	1.0
Im kind of thinking what youre thinking Parker	I can kind of see why you chose that answer	1.0
So Parker your thinking that you explained	Dang it I did it again	0.0
Dang it I did it again	Ah I thought it was addition	3.0
Ah I thought it was addition	Me too	1.0
Me too	Same	1.0

We all messed up	We thought it was addition	1.0
Oh	I got one half	3.0
I got one half	A little more than one half	3.0
Thats what I literally just said the answer would be a little more than one half	I thought you said one and one half	0.0
I said it would be a little more than one and a half	Is it a half	3.0
No	Half	3.0
Half	One and a half	3.0

Alright	Aw	0.0
Aw	I got my answer wrong	0.0
Share your opinion	Okay well Im on a roll	0.0
Okay well Im on a roll	I kind of made a Because at my old school what we would do when were estimating fractions Well just bump one up so I bumped the two up to a four and then I did four plus four	4.0
Right	Yeah	0.0
Two and one fourth See can I tell you guys something Im noticing	Yeah	0.0
Parkers talking not paying attention	What	0.0
Is that clear	Yes	0.0
Isnt that closer to a two than it is to three	Yeah	0.0
So I dont know why we would bump it up to four	Oh so would I have bumped it up to a three	3.0
Which benchmark fraction its closer to and its closer to two than it is to three	Okay	0.0
Let me show you something	Its kind of floating in my mind	0.0
Nolan	Yeah	0.0
Im going to take a token away from you every time you do that	Okay	0.0
Okay	I only have one token	0.0
Then it sounds like youre going to owe me some	I was about to say you could just do the line	3.0
Two and one fourth is about here right	Yes	0.0
Does that make sense to you	It will soon enough	0.0
Do you agree that this is two and one fourth	Yes	0.0
Is it closer to two or is it closer to three	Closer to two	3.0
Did that make sense now	I think I got the answer wrong	3.0
So lets just see	No learning	0.0

Were trying to share our math thinking right now not having a whole side conversation to be videotaped to see how fast we can be	We need a video	0.0
We need a video	Oh I forgot about that	0.0
Oh I forgot about that	I disagree with Parker because as you said two and one fourth is closer to two than it is to three	4.0
I disagree with Parker because as you said two and one fourth is closer to two than it is to three	So then to me I thought it would be just one third after two and a half	4.0
So Miller what do you think of Juliets answer	I disagree	1.0
Discuss	I would move it a little close except	3.0
Alright Miller please continue to share	I kind of agree with Juliet yet still disagree	1.0
Okay	Except I put it more near the three because I immediately the one fourth and put a two and a half and I just simply added one fourth	4.0
I want to hear from one more person	Yay me	0.0
Yay me	Aw	0.0
Frida	I agree with Miller	1.0
Sorry Frankie and are not listening to you Okay	I agree with Hunter and Miller because I put it more where Miller said	1.0
I agree with Hunter and Miller because I put it more where Miller said	A fourth of the two and a half	1.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I put it more where Miller put it	1.0
Nolan	I put it where Adri did because I just broke up two from the one fourth and just did it two and a half because thats on the number line and instead of one third I put one fourth	4.0

Twelve is our Piper	Yay	0.0
Yay	So I put it right after one half because we were starting at three and I put 13 16ths behind from two so I set that aside and I knew that three minus two equals one so I put it there	4.0
So I put it right after one half because we were starting at three and I put 13 16ths behind from two so I set that aside and I knew that three minus two equals one so I put it there	And since 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought it would be a little bit close to a half	4.0
What do you think of Pipers answer	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So I think its right after A little bit to the side from a half because were starting at three and so I took the 13 16ths aside for right now and I knew that three minus two equals one so I started by putting a little dot by one so I wouldnt forget	4.0
So I think its right after A little bit to the side from a half because were starting at three and so I took the 13 16ths aside for right now and I knew that three minus two equals one so I started by putting a little dot by one so I wouldnt forget	And then I knew that 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought that it would be a little bit close to a half	4.0
And then I knew that 13 is close to 16 by three so I thought that it would be a little bit close to a half	I disagree and agree	1.0
I disagree and agree	I agree with your explanation but I disagree with where you put your dot	1.0
I agree with your explanation but I disagree with where you put your dot	I put my dot closer to the zero because I thought 13 16ths are more than a half so Ive got to delete a half so I put it more near to zero	4.0
Lets pick someone new	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Frankie and Parker	0.0
What do you think about what Miller just shared	I agree with Miller	1.0
Say that again	I agree with Miller because three and two already makes one but 13 16ths is already half so you have to take away a half and you still have a little more so I put it a little close to zero	4.0
So	I thought it was lunch time for some reason	0.0

Okay	The door has a window	0.0
And go	Crosstalk	0.0
And another pair wasnt quite discussing that but I do want to hear	You press this button	0.0
And how are the problems different	inaudible Im gonna do Number two	0.0
okay	But I got the number one	0.0
But I got the number one	So I think its I think inaudible and I think inaudible Because inaudible so we dont have three and because the denominators on the question are five five And theres the same	4.0
so they have a common denominator	And then since the four minus one again and the like and the numerator is the same thing inaudible	3.0
Okay so you said the common denominator is teh same so you could do the format is 1 for 35th and four minus the whole number	Darn it	0.0
inaudible Did you agree with Lionels answer	Can you say your answer again inaudible	0.0
Can you say your answer again inaudible	So I said we think thats because the inadudible were three inauidble and because the numerators are four minus one and three and because of the dominators are the same inaudible	4.0
So Lionels answer was three and three fifths	I agree with Lionels answer	1.0
I agree with Lionels answer	I got the same answer	1.0
Wayne	Theyre similar and different	3.0
Theyre similar and different	theyre similar Is their both like the denominators of the non whole numbers are odd	3.0
Okay	Theyre similar	3.0
Theyre similar	Is that each others answers that has one	3.0
how we problem similar or different	Theyre similar because they both have inauidble They have the same denominators	4.0
What do you call it when you have the same denominator	Common denominator	3.0
Oh so Lily would you say Are you saying that thats something they have similar in both problems are already a common denominator	Yeah And then different is I dont know how to explain	2.0
And I know you can explain it	So number you can subtract one from the four but number two you cant subtract two from inauidble	3.0
Kaliah	I didnt actually do this in my book because I got an addition	0.0
I didnt actually do this in my book because I got an addition	But you have to turn three into two and add it to go once or be four	4.0
So we can do four minus two is what everybody	Two	3.0
So we have two thirds and two minus one is	One	3.0
Argo	trade first then subtract	3.0
it was inauidble a trade first but we were re Whoo	regrouping	3.0
What was different is that in the first problem you can subtract without regrouping	Yes	0.0
Does that fall in line with what you guys have to do	Yes	0.0
Hannah	Howd you get 43rds If the max is three thirds	2.0
was there a max	Not a max	3.0
Not a max	Its not technically a max	1.0
Its not technically a max	But how did you get 43rds	2.0
I added those three thirds to the 13 and got four thirds	I guess three plus one is four	4.0
were all fine	Was it on	0.0
Okay can you guys do me a favor and perhaps remember that were doing a math lesson that is recorded	Crosstalk	0.0
It would be helpful if we kept our talk related to math	crosstalk	0.0
Talk about how you would estimate inaudible	How to  estimate is to is to see the the denominator I saee the denominator then I look at the numerator and see if I can do it quickly in my head	3.0
How to  estimate is to is to see the the denominator I saee the denominator then I look at the numerator and see if I can do it quickly in my head	And if I can inaudible that wthe quickest way or to estimate the quickest way	3.0
And if I can inaudible that wthe quickest way or to estimate the quickest way	crosstalk	0.0
How do you estimate for number three William	So I rounded nine to 10 and eight to 10	4.0
So I rounded nine to 10 and eight to 10	So I did 10 minus 10 equals zero	4.0
So I did 10 minus 10 equals zero	if my estimate is correct my answer will be close to zero	4.0
HOld on  you said this is close to a whole	Yes	0.0
And then you said this is close to a whole	Yes	0.0
What about estimate from number four  Alex	For number four I turned three thirds into a whole inaudible and the 13rd into a whole	3.0
it doesnt have to be closer to zero or a whole it could be close to half	inauidble nevermind	0.0
So a whole minus half is about what	A half	3.0
Were going to end up with close	to a half	3.0
Hold on	I did not want to be chosen	0.0
And share with the class how you solved it	I guess	0.0
okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So the first thing I did is estimate	3.0
Uh huh	And my estimate was close to zero	3.0
Okay	Because nine minus 8 is 110th is one	4.0
Because nine minus 8 is 110th is one	And the denominators and the numerators are the same so it would be inauidble	4.0
Is that your estimate or your answer	Thats my estimate	3.0
turn face us so that everyone like including Marlowe year can hear you	Okay so how I got my answer is nine minus 8 is one	4.0
Okay so how I got my answer is nine minus 8 is one	9 minus eight isOne	4.0
9 minus eight isOne	And the denominators are the same	0.0
And the denominators are the same	So all you do is minusing 8	0.0
minusing	subtracting	3.0
Yeah so ask Hannah a question or respond to this answer	I agree with your answer very much	1.0
Because	because nine minus eight is one	4.0
because nine minus eight is one	Also is subtracting past tense	0.0
Because just distracting me	Any more questions	0.0
Any more questions	I agree with your answer	1.0
I agree with your answer	I think you did a good job	1.0
I think you did a good job	Thank you	0.0

So lets make sure we do a great job of	I will write this with honor	0.0
So lets listen to Franc and his explanations	So you can either do four goes into three equals 12 or you could multiply them and do well	4.0
to get your common denominator	And then so our common denominator is 12 and then inaudible	0.0
SO hes not taking comments right now hes still explaining	three times 3 is nine	4.0
three times 3 is nine	inauidble subtract inaudible	4.0
Cory what do you think of that	I agree with you inauidble I like how you got your common denominator and you said you multiplied	1.0
When you multiply 2 denominators what method is that for common denominator	Multiple	3.0
Nope	QDC	3.0
What do you think about Clays answer	Hello CLay	0.0
Hello CLay	Hi	0.0
Hi	So I i think  inauidble i politely Okay okay	0.0
So I i think  inauidble i politely Okay okay	So is 412ths youre answer or is 512ths	2.0
So is 412ths youre answer or is 512ths	My answer	0.0
My answer	okay so your answers 5ths	1.0
inaudible right now but his answers 512ths	Okay	0.0
Okay	So my I I slightly disagree	1.0
So my I I slightly disagree	Okay	0.0
Okay	Because is that 912ths	1.0
Because is that 912ths	Yeah this is 9 this is 4	1.0
Yeah this is 9 this is 4	I write fours like that	0.0
I write fours like that	How did you get the 9	2.0
How did you get the 9	where did you get the 9 from	2.0
where did you get the 9 from	three times three is 9  so on you do the same thing	4.0
three times three is 9  so on you do the same thing	Because you will explain that to get that becomes 9 the denominator is 12 so I made a slight mistake on that	4.0
Because you will explain that to get that becomes 9 the denominator is 12 so I made a slight mistake on that	I agree with your answer but I I did I did I did something wrong	1.0
I agree with your answer but I I did I did I did something wrong	I forgot to do four times one and three times three	3.0
So you understand it now	Okay	0.0
Okay	inauidble	0.0
Thank you Duke you got 2 days in a row	Lucky	0.0
Im going to give you 2 minutes to discuss your answer	for number five I got close to 3	3.0
Do you guys need more time	Yes	0.0
DO your math boxes	If we both finished can we share	0.0
You can always look to the page and work on your map boxes if youre done	I thought matg boxes ibauidble	0.0
okay so lets look at the answers	Have you been doing it	0.0
Have you been doing it	well Havent you you need to be sharing with a partner	0.0
Argo	How howd they get one and five six and five and eight fifteenths	2.0
How howd they get one and five six and five and eight fifteenths		1.0
Would you guys agree with that	Yeah	0.0
And two minus one is one	I knew I was missing something because I just realized that as soon as you put the as soon as you did the denominators I knew what I did wrong	3.0
Did you guys see what you did	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I cant see	0.0
Did you have a question Duke	No	0.0
Youre just not getting it	No Im not inauidble	0.0
But you see what you did wrong	No	0.0
Can you explain for Duke	The answer is 1 and 56th Because if you did the QCD you were to get six as your common denominator	4.0
The answer is 1 and 56th Because if you did the QCD you were to get six as your common denominator	And you do the usual you get three sixth and  two six but you cant do that because inauidble	4.0
And you do the usual you get three sixth and  two six but you cant do that because inauidble	and then you have to  take the whole and then make it to eight and then subtract it	4.0
So did you hear that Duke	Yes	0.0
What would you do	Id	0.0
Tell us how it is whats the right answer	Equals two	3.0
So Elliot how did you know this answer was two	Well one Im ever on that  two if you didnt know it you subtract four	3.0
How do you know I wasnt looking for a smiley face	Its a mathematics problem	3.0
Aaron what do you think	Because if you add two plus four you would get six	4.0
Whats it be called that when you had to write the equation with the Emmerson	The unknown	3.0
I know its early but we got to wake up here	Yes	0.0
Very likely	No	0.0
Ailani whats my unknown	Your unknown is the number that you have to subtract	3.0
What number would that be	Two	3.0
Aisha you cant figure out that unknown	No	0.0
What is it Alani	Two	3.0
The information that someone speaks gets processed in your brain and then your response comes out of your	Mouth	3.0
Oh what number is going in	Six	3.0
Elliot		3.0
So going from in to out is the number getting bigger or smaller	Bigger	3.0
Alexia what two operations can we use to make a number get bigger	A bigger number	3.0
What two operations can we use to make a number get bigger	Multiplication and addition	3.0
Well unfortunately we dont yet because can we use both addition and subtraction to make a six into a 12	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mmhmm	1.0
And if were going to multiply were going to multiply by one	Two	3.0
So on our second clue what number are we putting in this time	Four	3.0
What number do we want to get out	10 12	3.0
Can we multiply by two	No	0.0
No because whats four times two	Eight	3.0
So that leaves us with what	Adding six	3.0
If were going to add six if I add six and four what do I get		3.0
If I add six and six what do I get		3.0
What is our operation going to be	Plus six	3.0
Oh I dont like using the word plus	Add six	3.0
Talk louder	Two	3.0
Whats going to come out of its mouth	Eight	3.0
Emmerson		3.0
In this row right here	Whats coming out of the mouth	3.0
So if weve been adding whats the opposite of adding	Subtraction	3.0
So simply subtract six from nine and what do we get	Three	3.0
If we put three into the ear and we add six will it give us nine	Yes	0.0
How many clues do we have Adeline	Three	3.0
I only count two clues	Two	0.0
And we have those two rows right there that are completed correct	Yes	0.0
So are the numbers going in the ear coming out of the mouth getting larger or getting smaller	Large	3.0
Large	Smaller	1.0
Anson are they getting larger or smaller	Smaller	3.0
Emmerson which two operations do we have to use	Subtraction and division	3.0
Ace	smaller than the other one	3.0
Elliot what do you think that reason might be	Thatd be easier to divide	3.0
What number are we dealing with	Fives	3.0
What number would I have to subtract from 20 to equal five Aldo		3.0
Oh this is why I said we have them memorize our facts Aaron	Five times four	3.0
So if we divide 20 by four itll give us five correct	Yes	0.0
If I put 12 into the ear and I subtract 15 am I going to get three	You going to get a negative three	3.0
We now know that we are going to be dividing by	Four	3.0
Four times what equals 12 Aldo	Four times three equals 12	3.0
Does it work	Yep	0.0
Ember whats my rule	Divide by four	3.0
Well lets try to do them anyway shall we	Yep	0.0
Any number divided by itself is always going to give you Amaya	One	3.0
Alvin	Four times seven	3.0
So 28 divided by four is	Seven	3.0
Mr Ember where would you start my friend	Draw a robot	3.0
Mr Ember once you have that robot drawn out what are you going to do	Put the number in the ear and figure out a rule	3.0
So why dont you walk me through Mr Ember what you would do to do so	look at the clue	3.0
So Ember says were going to look at the clue which clue do you want to use Ember	Three and 15	3.0
So what am I going to do with that clue Mr Ember	Youre going to see how much it takes youre going to add  to see where it gets to 15	3.0
So what number is going into the ear of the robot	Three	3.0
I think addition is a great place to start but why did you choose it	Itd be Emmerson to come up to give you 15	3.0
But how did you know we arent subtracting here	Because the numbers getting bigger	4.0
So Embers thinking were going to add what does he have to do next Ace	He has to find the number for the rule	1.0
What other number do we already know in the robot	Eight	3.0
What other number do we already know and where does that belong	In his mouth	3.0
And if we are going to add Miss Ansona what will we have to add in order to get 15 out of the mouth		3.0
What is our other option here Van	We can multiply it by three	3.0
And if we multiply what are we going to multiply by	Five	3.0
Everybody got it	Mmhmm	0.0
So Amaya how are we going to determine which one of those is correct	Were going to use whatever	3.0
We going to have to do what	We going to see if either of those	3.0
Elliot what	The next clue	3.0
Aliza what do you think	I think what can help us is eight and 40 because you cant Well you can add something to eight to get 40 but its going to take a long time	4.0
Why do you think we have to have two clues	I think we have to have two clues because  you will have to go to the second clue	4.0
Can you try to explain it	So then you can use division and subtraction	3.0
Is that going to work	Yeah	0.0
Alexia	Eight times 5 equals 40	4.0
What about the other one	equals 40	3.0
So if you didnt hear what Alexia just said Alexia just said that eight times five equals 40 but eight plus 12 only equals		3.0
	So if you do addition its	3.0
If you do addition then	Its times 12	3.0
Does it work	No it doesnt work	3.0
Because what do I have to get out of the mouth	You need to get 40	3.0
But what did I get out of the mouth		3.0
	Which is 20 less	3.0
So now that we know what is our rule Ailani what is our rule going to be	12 plus 12	3.0
What is that rule going to be Emmerson	Times five	3.0
Can we use fourth grade terminology	Multiply by five	3.0
Aaron what comes out		3.0
So Elliot what are we going to have to do to figure this out	We going to have to divide 20 by five	3.0
Beautiful which is	Four	3.0
Are you guys starting to understand why I say how important it is for you to understand your multiplication facts	Yes	0.0
I know what youre doing	You missed an L	0.0
Lets go with multiplication instead of multiplication although I do like learning about dogs	Me too	0.0
Ezra what do multiplication facts mean	Uh factors multiples	3.0
So when I say multiplication facts when I tell you to practice your multiplication facts what should you be practicing	Basic multiplication	3.0
Ricky what would I ask you to do	Uh practice your times tables	3.0
Youre absolutely right but what do you mean by that	One times five	3.0
Carrington	multiplication time test	3.0
Van	Single digit multiplication facts	3.0
Cade	Adding more but just adding zero to it	3.0
Caspien	If you multiplylike if you multiply any number by zero youll get like zero	4.0
You dont have to write this one down	Is that even a number	0.0
Five quintillion times	Zero	3.0
Finely	Zero	3.0
It doesnt matter how big this is zero times all these zeros is going to be zero but then when we get all the way out here to the quadrillions zero times three is still	Zero	3.0
So shall we begin	Mmhmm	0.0
Most easiest is redundant but yes	So super duper easy	0.0
You all know the answer because this is the one I made you write a 100 times class what is the answer		3.0
Lets try that one	Laughs	0.0
Seven times eight equals 56 everyone is in agreement with this yes	Yes	0.0
Whats seven times eight		3.0
Whats zero times eight	Zero	3.0
Zero	Partial product	3.0
Yes but were not gonna call it that yet	Oh	0.0
The answers just 56 isnt it	No	0.0
So Im right	No	0.0
Ezra why do you think Im not right	Well you zero left you dont times it	4.0
Well you zero left you dont times it	You do not multiply it by eight	4.0
You do not multiply it by eight	So you just take the zero and add it to the end of the number	4.0
Florian	Um seven times eight is 56	3.0
I got that up there	Theres 70 and thats not single number	3.0
No theres two there but then I did eight times zero is zero	So we have to put the zero next to the	3.0
Carrington	70 is in the tenths place not the ones	3.0
See fives in the tenth place	You are impossible	0.0
Caspien what do you think	So what I think is since seven times eight is 56	3.0
Yup	But the wrong you wrote the wrong answer for us 70 times eight	4.0
But the wrong you wrote the wrong answer for us 70 times eight	So like you just leave the zero alone you take it out of the number and then you get seven times eight 56	4.0
Which is what wrote	And then you put the zero after the six	3.0
Am I right	No	0.0
Why not	Because  number	0.0
Ricky what do you think	I think that seven times eight is 56	4.0
I think that seven times eight is 56	You do not add the zero you put the zero after the six but do not add it	4.0
You do not add the zero you put the zero after the six but do not add it	You just put it after and dont put any single	4.0
I just put a zero on it just because you said to put a zero on it	No	0.0
What do you think	I think if we add ten times no	3.0
I think if we add ten times no	Ten times 50 it should give us 500 then	4.0
Anybody think number ones wrong	No	0.0
Angelina what is the difference	ten times eight  ten times eight again  in zero  seven	3.0
First factor	Seven	3.0
My second factor		3.0
Amoura	Eight	3.0
So if I had seven of these little cubes and I put them in piles how many piles will I have	Eight	3.0
Eight piles with seven little cubes in each of them there would be 56 little cubes correct	Yeah	0.0
Bruno	Instead of just seven in each handful youd have 70	3.0
So Id have how many of these	Seven	3.0
For all seven		3.0
How many piles do I have	You have eight since the equation is 70 times eight	4.0
Whats different	Its ten times bigger	3.0
49 and our last group of seven is 56		0.0
Were counting up by what	10s	3.0
So here 70 times eight is not 56 its 560 but do we care about the zero	No	0.0
Without the zero what answer do we get		3.0
Francis whats seven times eight		3.0
What are the first two digits of your answer		3.0
So as I stated Clyde what are my first two numbers of my answer going to be	78	3.0
In my answer Clyde		3.0
Finely	Five	3.0
Guess how many zeros have to go in my answer	Five	3.0
Caspien	Um so like technically all we gotta do when we see like multi digit multiplication problems is add zeros to like after our numbers	3.0
There we go	Thank you	0.0
Youre welcome	Thank you	0.0
Youre welcome	Thank you	0.0
Carrington what do you see	In the first example the  column with 300 it counts up by 300	4.0
Crosby	In the  box it counts up by 2000	3.0
Finely	Its counting up by 80s	4.0
So this first one is asking you take this number and multiply it by this number	Ohhhh	0.0
And we get the same thing we had up on the board earlier right	Yes	0.0
Analies		3.0
Were no longer multiplying by eight what are we multiplying by	Nine	3.0
Finely		3.0
And how many zeros do we have Finely	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	One	3.0
Caspien		3.0
And how many zeros Caspien	How many zeros theres one two three	3.0
Nine times 400 how many zeros	Two	3.0
You may start wherever you would like to start in this problem but you just have to tell us how and what you did	I was gonna start with	0.0
Dont talk to the board the board doesnt care	Im gonna start with 80 times five	3.0
Talk to them	80 times five	3.0
How come	I just picked the first problem	3.0
First box	First box	0.0
First box	So 80 times five	4.0
So 80 times five	So I took eight and then five 40 and then took the zero and	4.0
Curious cause you dont even have your paper in front of you to look	Paper fell off my desk	0.0
So what answer did you get Mr Francis	I got 450	3.0
Ricky you agree with him	Wait no	1.0
All right so Mr Francis why do you think its 450 when Ezra says its only 400	I kept counting up by five	3.0
80 times	Mmhmm	0.0
Thatd take you forever	I only counted up 58 times thats how I got my answer	3.0
Hold up eight digits hold up eight fingersKay now count up by fives		3.0
And add a zero to the end of that		3.0
All right Annabelle pick somebody to help you	So the box that Annabelle pointed to is the second one in the five column	2.0
Indeed	And the equation for that one would be five times 600	3.0
Five times 600Okay	So I took away	3.0
Whats wrong with I dog	First of all it doesnt have  and is it talking about do you love your dog or do you  the dog	3.0
So its missing things	Yeah	0.0
Were good now right	No	0.0
Arabella	It makes no sense	3.0
Help me make it make sense	I am a dog	3.0
So I just gave you a very huge hint to what is wrong with Ms Annabelles number sentence	Ohhh	0.0
What is six times five Ms AnnabelleCount up by fives six times		3.0
And whats missing	Another zero	3.0
Whats eight times five		3.0
Yes Florian	May I please go to restroom	0.0
With some confidence	560	3.0
What is seven times six Crosby		3.0
Beautiful and Mr Crosby how many zeros do we have in the problem	two	3.0
Does the board look exactly like whats on your sheet	Yes	0.0
I hope so because I copied it directly from the sheet	Do we write both things	0.0
I give you one	Thank you	0.0
I give me one I give you one	Thank you	0.0
Me you	Thank you	0.0
Me you	Thank you	0.0
Hunter can you do me a favor and go close the door for me	Yeah	0.0

Hadleys first number is 43 Honour what is her four worth		3.0
Haven	Three	3.0
Hunter	60 and two	3.0
Donna	30 and 6	3.0
Look at her number	Oh	0.0
Uh huh its a nine and a six 96	90 and six	3.0
What are her two tens places Aubriella	40 and 90	3.0
Avah	40 and six	3.0
Does everybody understand what we just did	Mmhmm	0.0
Dash	That came from having numbers of 60  of Hadleys numbers between 43 and 96	4.0
That came from having numbers of 60  of Hadleys numbers between 43 and 96	And like Hadleys numbers  between 63 and 62	4.0
Huh	I was trying to say 40	3.0
Were going to start with three times	90	3.0
Whats left to multiply Enzo	The ones	3.0
In my case Ford what am I going to multiply	Three times three	3.0
Cecelia help her out	The six and three	3.0
Remember what we practiced yesterday multiplying by extended facts	Mmhmm	0.0

As of right now who wins	Hadley	3.0
Youre more than welcome to check mine if you want Im going to check yours just to make sure that you added everything correctly	Im pretty sure I didnt	0.0
Avah	Because it was not neat and it was kind of small	3.0
Maybe it did	Can you get the remote and unfreeze it	0.0
Hadley nice job you get to pick who my next opponent is	Haven	0.0
Who would have won that one myself or Hadley	Hadley	3.0
Ill just erase all this we dont need the lines	Can you just erase the whole thing	0.0
Switch it to pen	Looks like Im not too short	0.0
Hadley did you give me your cards back	Yeah	0.0
Now that the deck is shuffled how many cards does Haven get	Four	3.0
How many cards do I get	Four	3.0

What should her second number be Dash		3.0
Ariana what do I do	Um	0.0
Honour whats my first team going to be	Your first team is 80 plus one	3.0
Mr Harry what is my second team going to be	40 and seven	3.0
If you reverse those you got it right	70 and four	3.0
Ford what is Havens first team going to be	Its going to be 80 and five	3.0
Beautiful and her second team Armani is going to be what	90 and nine	3.0
Change that to a you have to jump over so change that to a	Four	3.0
This should be a one times	Seven	3.0
Avah what do I get	80 and 70	3.0
Donna what will that be	70 no	3.0
70 no	80 times four	3.0
Look how many times is 80 in our products so far	Two	3.0
What should this be	Five	3.0
Did you follow me or Haven	Haven	0.0
Class seven times eight		3.0
How many zeros	Two	3.0
What does that line represent	A one	3.0
What exists in every number but we dont always write it because were lazy	Two	3.0
Two	The decimal	3.0
How many zeros do I have	Two	3.0
Class nine times eight		3.0
How many zeros	Two	3.0
What would you do	You could move them here	3.0
You got to make sure that your answer is written right there	Okay	0.0
Hugo what is eight times four		3.0
How many zeros do I have Hugo	Two	3.0
Two	One	3.0
How many zeros does she have	One	3.0
Whats 70 times one		3.0

My final one four times one	Four	3.0
Five times nine same number		3.0
You think you got it	I do	3.0
Everybody whether you did Havens or mine look at mine and tell me where I messed up because I messed up	Oh I see it	0.0
Harry is seven plus two plus zero nine	Yes	0.0
Whats six plus three Harry	Nine	3.0
Plus one		3.0
Whats five plus one Harry	Six	3.0
So what did I do wrong Avah	Your regrouping	3.0
She cheated	No I didnt	0.0
Yes you did	No	0.0
Thank you Haven good job	Thank you	0.0
Is it on the very first page	No	0.0
The inside cover	There it is	0.0
There it is	Its on the back cover	0.0
Are there any questions about how this works	No	0.0
So Anna come on up and walk us through how youre going to start solving this problem	Im going to start	0.0
Got to talk nice and loud	Im going to start by	0.0
Why didnt she just add them	She multiplied because if you add them it wont be the same number	4.0
What number would you get if you added them	Five	3.0
Jamie can you explain to us why that doesnt work	That doesnt work because you need to do each number twice	4.0
That doesnt work because you need to do each number twice	Each	0.0
Youre absolutely right but explain in a little more detail	Uhmm	0.0
We do our horns	Yes	0.0
So Jamie walk us through what you mean and have explain it to Anna so she can show everybody what youre talking about	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you need to multiply the 200	3.0
So start at the 200 and do what	And multiply it by 40	3.0
How do we show that visually	We write 200	3.0
You can show it with what	We make our arrows going from 200 to 40	3.0
Youre absolutely right but why	Because we multiply the largest numbers first	4.0
But can we think of a better way to say the largest numbers	Multiply the largest place value	3.0
So then what do we do	Then we do our next largest on the left and multiply it by the largest on the right	3.0
So Ms Elaina what are you going to do now	Now were going to write the multiple	3.0
Will those be multiples	No	0.0
What would they actually be	The body	3.0
What are they	A factor	3.0
A factor or two factors	Two	3.0
So what are you going to do in number two	200 times five	3.0
Jalen	100 times one	3.0
Tell us what youre going to do now	Im going to do	0.0
There you go	Im going to take the six and jump over the five	3.0
Thats what I just heard	60 times 40	3.0
Then what	Im going to take the six again 60 again and then multiply it by five	3.0
Okay what are you going to do now Jimmy	Im going to take the five from the 265 and add it times 40	3.0
And multiply it times 40	Yeah	0.0
And then what	Then Im going to do five times five	3.0
Mr Jimmy now what are you going to do	Im going to multiply all of them together but starting with the first one	3.0
200 times five times 60 times 40 times 60 times five times five times 40 times five times five	Im only going to multiply 200 times 40	3.0
Im only going to multiply 200 times 40	And then Im going to move down to the next one	3.0
Jairo switch	So now	0.0
So now	Im going to multiply 60 times 40	4.0
Im going to multiply 60 times 40	Four times six is 24	4.0
Four times six is 24	And then I add in the two zeros	4.0
And then I add in the two zeros	And I get 2400	4.0
And I get 2400	And then six times 60 times five equals Six times five equals	4.0
Just take your finger like this Just tap it	And then that equals 30 and then I add in the one zero	3.0
Tell us	Im going to do 60 times five	3.0
That was already done	Five times 60	3.0
Thats actually a four	Okay	0.0
Make it look like a four for me please	This one	0.0
What do you get when you multiply five times four		3.0
And how many zeros	One	3.0
Whats my problem then if you got it right	Than your place value	3.0
All right Mr Jean what now	Now we do five times five	3.0
All right Mr Jalen what are you going to do	Im going to add all the	3.0
Im going to add all the	Im going to add the	3.0
You took the time to do step number six which was to add our addition symbol	Then Im going to add all these up	3.0
So lets see it	Is that a seven	3.0
You think its a seven	Yeah	0.0
The way that we have this written Joanna	Because	0.0
Because it what	Because	0.0
Class		3.0
Leon what does one and a half look like	onefourth and then	3.0
Theres the one whole right	Yeah	0.0
Then what does a half look like	Half of the whole thing	3.0
Describe your picture	It looks like two squares	3.0
All right and then what does two look like Elyse	Its just two big squares with four of each	3.0
What was your answer for 2C or 2B	My answer for 2B was	0.0
Whatd you get for 2B	Trapezoid	3.0
A trapezoid because one whole equals threethirds right	Yeah	0.0
Well fourthirds is the same thing as having a whole one right	No	0.0
Kane	Hexagon	3.0
Johnny	Fivethirds would be a trapezoid and two triangles	3.0
Youre absolutely	A rhombus	3.0
Did you do your homework	I forgot the bottom part	0.0
What is our missing denominator		3.0
Esme		3.0
Number six Estrella		3.0
So if you look at the instructions on this paper	Can I go get a pencil	0.0
Kane what do you think	Because its half of the rectangle	4.0
Leon	Twofourths	3.0
Knox	Because twofourths is	4.0
Because twofourths is	If they only can use one for the numerator you cant have two as the numerator	4.0
Jules	Were going to have to divide by two	3.0
Genevieve what very important rule did I forget when I did this	Whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the top	3.0
If youre going to divide something youre going to have to divide both the top and the bottom of your fraction which would of course leave us with	One	3.0
How many pieces do they want to break it into this time	Nine	3.0
Is that wrong or right	Right	3.0
Is what I did on the board wrong or right	Right	3.0
Huh	Right	3.0
So why cant we use it	Because	0.0
Kye why cant we do it	Because in the directions you dont use one fractions more than once	4.0
So now what I have to do is I have to find a fraction which still has a numerator of one that is equal to the same amount as these three right here	Threeninths	3.0
What would this box be Kameron	Threeninths	3.0
Keegan what can we do	Divide it by three	3.0
Keegan what am I going to get	Onethird	3.0
Threeninths right	Yes	0.0
So if this was threeninths instead of onethird would it work	Yeah	0.0
What does it mean for two fractions to be equal	You have the same amount	3.0
But in order to eat the same amount we have to eat how many slices here	Three	3.0
So how many lines will you have	Seven	3.0
What was the first thing you did Miss Genevieve	So I wrote down oneeighth plus twoeighths equals threeeighths	4.0
Okay then what did you do	And then in the rectangle I wrote seven lines	3.0
Okay I got it	And I colored in two of them	3.0
Did you color two to start or one to start	Two	3.0
Then whatd you do	And then I put dots in the third one to represent oneeighth	3.0
So you colored in the third one now	Yeah	0.0
Now whatd you do	Down below I wrote twoeighths and for the third one I wrote oneeighth	3.0
Okay so just like I have over here	Yeah	0.0
Okay then tell me what to do Miss Grace	You have to divide	3.0
You must speak louder	We have to divide	3.0
What am I dividing	Eight divided by two	3.0
Im old	Eight divided by two	3.0
Where is this eight coming from that you want me to divide	The denominator	3.0
The denominator	I dont know	2.0
What cant we have up here	The two	3.0
What does it actually do Keegan	It cuts it in half	3.0
Would everybody agree	Yes	0.0
But if I do it in red how many pieces do I have	Four	3.0
How many red pieces do I have	Four	3.0
The total is	Four	3.0
Johnny	Its not a question exactly about this but what if you have an odd number and you try to	2.0
I started by drawing or coloring in three squares	So you decided to start with three right	3.0
Mmhmm	And what fraction did you say that these three were worth	0.0
312	Okay	3.0
What was your next move	Then I colored in two	3.0
And what was your fraction here	212	3.0
All right so Miss Elyse what did you do now	And then I added three plus two to get 512	4.0
Perfect	And then I divided 212 by two	3.0
Why didnt you leave it this way	Because	0.0
Why did you change it	Because it cant be two in the numerator	4.0
So you took your 212 and what did you do with it Miss Elyse	I divided 212 by two and the numerator and the denominator	4.0
And what did you come up with	And I got onesixth	3.0
What did you do now	Then I	0.0
So what did you do	Then I divided 312 by And then I got onefourth	3.0
Whats onefourth plus onesixth	I think it would be 512	3.0
Exactly right because we need to find a common denominator we could find between these two		3.0
All right whats your question Johnny	Its not a question but	0.0
You did it different	I did one part just	0.0
Knox this is the way you did it so what did you add to 112	What I added to 112 was 412	3.0
And now we have the right answer right	Mmhmm	0.0
Four divided by what equals one	Four	3.0
Whatever we do to the top	We do to the bottom	3.0
Did you still have a question Johnny	No	0.0
Elyse	There was less steps	1.0
Johnny	Even	3.0
The problem is youre not going to be able to divide both of those by one	This is hard	0.0
Or you can start with a different addend other than one	You seem so happy	0.0
The whole idea is when you figure something cool out in math Thats why I give you those riddles every morning because those of you that have figured them out doesnt it feel cool when you figure out the actual answer for a challenging math problem	Yeah	0.0
In the red how many of them are going to be red	Two	3.0
Ask questions	So I started with 210 up there	3.0
Just tap the board	Yep	0.0
Go	And for 210 I divided them both by two	3.0
Leon	Because in the rules it says you cant have more than one in the numerator	4.0
So she picked two because two divided by two is	One	3.0
There you go	Now my pen color is black	0.0
Hmm	Now the pen color is black	0.0
Okay now what are you doing	Im dividing them Oh my God	3.0
Guys relax	Im dividing them both by two to find my denominator	4.0
Im dividing them both by two to find my denominator	And 10 divided by two is five so I got onefifth for 210	4.0
So Miss Keegan as the T what would you tell people about 210 and onefifth	That theyre equivalent	3.0
Which means the	Same amount	3.0
All right so what are you going to do now Miss Keegan	And then for	0.0
You want to change it to blue	And then for 510 Now Ive forgotten what I did	2.0
Lets help her	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Um you divide five by five	3.0
Because	Because then your numerator would be one and then you do the same for the denominator	4.0
Because then your numerator would be one and then you do the same for the denominator	And then	0.0
Joella	Its half	3.0
What do you mean its half	Its half of 10	3.0
Its half of 10	Five is half of 10	4.0
Okay is 23 half of 46	Yes	0.0
So is that equal to onehalf	Yeah	0.0
What do you do now	So now I have onehalf which is 510	3.0
So now I have onehalf which is 510	And	0.0
Look at the question	Youre trying to make 710 so youre going to add onefifth and onehalf	4.0
Youre trying to make 710 so youre going to add onefifth and onehalf	So	0.0
Kase are you ready	Mmhmm	0.0
Thats how you show	I need to go to the restroom	0.0
Perfect	Thank you	0.0
I multiply by	Two	3.0
Johnny whatever I	Do to the bottom you do to the top	3.0
Onefifth is equivalent to	210	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
All right go ahead man	So I made the set of lockers	4.0
So I made the set of lockers	And then I found  eight	4.0
And then I found  eight	Why eight	0.0
Why eight	Because remember	0.0
Because remember	And then	0.0
So you set up eight lockers	This person every single one of these	3.0
I couldnt follow	I made an oval	4.0
I made an oval	So heres Jim	4.0
So heres Jim	So every other block	4.0
A little louder	All right	0.0
All right	So now Jimmy two is going to go to	3.0
Jimmy two we got two Jimmys	Yes	0.0
Yes	Every kid is named Jimmy	0.0
Thats kind of confusing	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	So every other locker  and she would agree to every third	3.0
So when you had your sample size how did you come up with your final number based on your sample size	Well I used a pattern	3.0
What was the pattern	So it started going by fours so it started going too long so it was that	4.0
Words are hard	So it started going down	3.0
So it started going down	Theres only one locker each time	3.0
Okay so what was your final answer	It was 200 because	3.0
200 opened or 200 closed	200 open	3.0
Okay	Because theres 800 here and then how many were open  and then 800 divided by 4 is 200	4.0
Do you want this or not	No	0.0
Okay	So what I put down is I drew 10 lockers and I put the number 108 because 100 times 10 is 1 000	4.0
So what I put down is I drew 10 lockers and I put the number 108 because 100 times 10 is 1 000	So  I put O for open  and then I did closed and then	4.0
What gave you your final number based on your what you saw from your sample	So then I got online	0.0
So then I got online	And I got seven and then I multiplied that by 100 and got 700 lockers where clothes and  that was three and I multiplied that by 100 and its 300 lockers	4.0
Walk us through yours	Okay so I drew 100 lockers and I drew 10 people	4.0
Okay so I drew 100 lockers and I drew 10 people	And I kept number one because they were already open so number one number two number two is right	4.0
And I kept number one because they were already open so number one number two number two is right	So I put a red tally on every single one that was closed	4.0
So I put a red tally on every single one that was closed	So number three I used blue four was orange five actually I used gray six was blue seven was brown eight was purple nine was yellow and ten was dark red	4.0
Okay	And then once I was done I counted how many were open and closed	4.0
And then once I was done I counted how many were open and closed	And there were 55 that were open and 45 that were closed	4.0
And there were 55 that were open and 45 that were closed	And then I multiply that by 10	4.0
And then I multiply that by 10	And I got 450 closed and 550 open	4.0
But you when youre doing your samples do you need to put more people than there are lockers	No	0.0
Mia what do you think	You can just repeat the first person	4.0
What	You can just repeat the first person on the locker	4.0
Rory	Well I think the reason you chose that is because that 20 is a factor of 1000	4.0
Riley	Its gonna well theres a row of 20 lockers	3.0
So after person one is here every single locker is	Open	3.0
Lucy	Every third	3.0
Theyre what	Every third	3.0
Emerson	Three	3.0
Rory	Multiples	3.0
369 12 1518 are multiples of what	Three	3.0
So whats it going to happen	Close	0.0
So what is person three gonna do	Open it	3.0
Whats person number four going to do	Open every fourth locker	3.0
Going to what	Open every fourth locker	3.0
So were dealing with multiples of	Four	3.0
Riley what do you think	Its because its a multiple	3.0
Can one go into eight	Yeah	0.0
Can two go into 8	Yeah	0.0
And if this fifth person comes along and touches every fifth locker which lockers Victoria will be touched by the fifth person	The fifth locker	3.0
Which locker	The fifth	3.0
Okay what else	The tenth	3.0
What else	The fifteenth	3.0
What else	The twentieth	3.0
So Rory which lockers are we going to be positive so far are going to remain open	One	3.0
Rory	Eleven	3.0
Charlie	Two	3.0
Diego	Seven	3.0
Emerson	Four	3.0
Do they touch any others	No	0.0
So seven is done and it is	Closed	3.0
Is nine done	Yes	0.0
And is it open	Yes	0.0
So Aiden in this sample how many lockers are open so far	Four	3.0
Riley what do you think	I think multiply four times five	3.0
Because if this sample were represented the rest of the way	No 400 times 5	3.0
Jordan what do you see	The pattern so far is open closed closed open closed closed closed	4.0
Closed	Oh I didnt notice that last one	0.0
What locker	25	3.0
Victoria	Divided by three	3.0
I have what	You have four two and then one more	3.0
Anthony	Factors	3.0
Alice whats unique about those numbers and their factors	Each factor is one number	3.0
Easy	One and three	3.0
How many factors is that	Two	3.0
Its two factors Okay pick another number my any number other than the open lockers pick	Six	3.0
Jordan what are the factors of six	One and two and three and six	3.0
Aiden pick one does not open	13	3.0
Aiden what are the factors of 13	1 and 13	3.0
How many factors is that	Two	3.0
Any number up here	12	3.0
Leah	Four and three	3.0
What else	Six and two	3.0
Total	Six	3.0
Huh	Even	3.0
How many factors does four have	Two	3.0
How many factors does nine have	Three	3.0
But how many factors does 16 have	Three	3.0
How many factors is this	Five	3.0
What are all of these numbers	Odd	3.0
Which means all of our closed lockers have what	An even number	3.0
And all of our open lockers have	Odd	3.0
Victoria what do you think	Times five	3.0
But what types of numbers have an odd number of factors	Square numbers	3.0
Easy	Six times six	3.0
Whats my next factor	49	3.0
Seven times	Seven	3.0
Whats next	64	3.0
Whats next	81	3.0
Whats next	100	3.0
Camila	144	3.0
Aiden	108	3.0
No	132	3.0
Thats 11 times 12	108	3.0
No	118	3.0
Lucy	121	3.0
Mia	Shapes	3.0
Huh	The only thing I know about geometry is that I feel like shapes	3.0
Rory	Angles	3.0
Rory	Segments	3.0
What did I just put on the board	Dots	3.0
James	Dots	3.0
In our world that has a name and were going to find it	Its a point	3.0
When did we use it	Decimal point	3.0
What does it do	The decimal point separates your whole from your fractions	3.0
Emerson	A point is where something starts	3.0
What did I just draw	A dash	3.0
A dash	A line sorry	3.0
Or do you know what it is	I think I know	0.0
Emerson theyre called	Line segments	3.0
So a line segment looks just like a line except where the arrows are there is a starting point and a	Ending point	3.0
For our line segments we put points on the ends for our starting and our stopping point but does a line have points	No	0.0
Rory	Is it called a ray	3.0
Do you know Miss Rory what a ray is	Where theres a point and a line going on forever	3.0
Aria	Because its passing through	4.0
Can I have more	Yes	0.0
Charlie what did I do	Wrote A and B	3.0
Diego	You labeled them	3.0
When you are writing lines line segments or rays you must label them with a minimum of	Two	3.0
But what did I use	Lines	3.0
Good you got something to learn man	I think its a shape thats	3.0
Its still line segment A B F is just a	Passthrough	3.0
Mr  what do you notice	Everything is a square and the smaller the proportions of the body the smaller the	4.0
Everything is a square and the smaller the proportions of the body the smaller the	I dont know measures	4.0
So in this unit of measure what is our largest unit of measure were going to be dealing with today when measuring liquid	Gallon	3.0
What is our smallest Jackson	Our smallest is cup	3.0
Let me ask a question how many gallons do you see up here	One	3.0
Do you see one of everything up there	Yeah	0.0
You only see one of everything	No	0.0
No	I see on both sides of the hand each side has cup and pint	3.0
Do we have a mirror image on each side	Yes	0.0
what do you notice	I notice that the smaller ones are more than	3.0
what do you notice	The numbers keep getting bigger	3.0
What do you mean	The numbers are getting bigger by how much	3.0
So as we go down our list we have more of them	Mmhmm	0.0
As we move down this list yes our number goes up but do our sizes go up or down	Up	3.0
Up	No down	1.0
No down	Down	1.0
So how many quart do you see	Four	3.0
Four	Four	1.0
Four	Four	1.0
Go ahead say it	Four	3.0
So in one gallon there are	One	3.0
One gallon there are	Four quarts	3.0
Ricky what about you	Eight	3.0
Alex	There are 16	3.0
Maya what pattern do you notice	I notice that 4 times 2 is equal 8 and 8 times 2 is 16	4.0
Van what do you notice	Its just a question	2.0
Yep	Is there a measurement smaller than a cup	0.0
Yes maam	I see a pattern that its going quart and	3.0
Pint	Pint pint cup cup cup	4.0
Now when you get there you will see something hopefully that looks just like this	Yep	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Easy	Two	3.0
How many pints are there in a quart	Theres two pints in a quart	3.0
Maya how many	I think theres four	3.0
In a half a gallon how many quarts would there be	Oh two	3.0
Three times two	Is six	3.0
What did you do	Well the first pint I drew	3.0
Perfect	And then I doubled that two	3.0
What do you mean you doubled it	Well its two	4.0
Well its two	And two is doubled one so then I doubled two	4.0
Mathematically speaking what do you do mathematically to double something	Add that number to itself	3.0
Whats another way we say that in math	Multiply it	3.0
How many	Four	3.0
Well in this if the pints are doubling so are the	Cups	3.0
We have two and what does it jump to	Four	3.0
How many cups are there going to be for three pints	Six	3.0
Huh	Six	3.0
What did you do	times two	3.0
Im old	Three times two	3.0
You multiplied three times two	Three times two	3.0
And that gave you six	Yeah	0.0
Joanna what are we going to do	You have to multiply by two	3.0
Carrington what are they giving us	Theyre giving us a cup	3.0
So can we use multiplication Jackson to get this one	Yes	0.0
But yes what are we really using here to solve this one	Division	3.0
Is it still going to be two	Yes	0.0
So Nancy when I divide 16 by 2 what do I get	I think the eight	3.0
Does this remind you guys of InNOut boxes	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Oh	0.0
So 16 divided by 2 gives us our 8	Eight	0.0
Whats nine times two		3.0
Is that a six I hope	Mmhmm	0.0
I got it	What did you need	0.0
Was trying to figure out how to annotate on that	Oh sorry	0.0
Oh sorry	I was recording	0.0
Eight cups in a gallon	Im not sure how	2.0
Huh	I think you  page	0.0
So this page is shopping for milk	Thank you	0.0
I know we go through an unimaginable amount of milk every week in my household	Thank you	0.0
From drinking it to drinking it with cereal	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	Thank you	0.0
Jose whatd I just do	Comparing it	3.0
what would you have	Two times eight	3.0
Hello	Yes	0.0
Its not a trick	Is it cup	1.0
Easy	Large or quarts	3.0
What I have written on the board are those the same thing	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mmhmm	1.0
Are equivalent fractions the same thing	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	1.0
Are those the same thing	No	0.0
No	Well yes	1.0
But what are they	The same amounts	3.0
Jose say that louder	The same amount	3.0
But are they the same exact thing	No	0.0
Are these the same	No	0.0
But are they going to give you the same amount	Yes	0.0
Because in this problem when were looking for a small size what is it worth	One cup	3.0
When were looking for a large size what is it worth	A quart	3.0
Sophia	The small one	3.0
Carrington why	Because were trying to figure out how much of the large container is a small container	4.0
So when it says what fraction of a large container what does that mean the large container must be	On the top	3.0
On the top	Oh wait	0.0
Ricky whats something you notice about my picture that I drew over there on the right side of the board	It keeps getting bigger every time	3.0
Is it random how much its getting bigger	No	0.0
what do you notice about that picture that I just drew	I notice that	0.0
Maya what do you notice	I notice that for the cup half of it goes into a pint	3.0
So if I take my cup and I stick it into my pint how much did I fill up	Half	3.0
Caitlin what do you notice	That the quart	3.0
You got to talk loud	That the quart if you split it in half it goes into pint	3.0
Maya what do you notice	That the gallons put into there because its the half because of the quart	4.0
So how many quarts does it take to fill a gallon	One	3.0
One	Or four	3.0
But if we have one we have how much of a gallon	12	3.0
12	14	3.0
A quart is	Half	3.0
A fourth of a	Gallon	3.0
Gallon	Or half of a half	3.0
Erica based on our key which container is a large container	The quart	3.0
Now that represents my whole correct	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Mmhmm	1.0
And by definition of a denominate a denominator is the total number of	Parts	3.0
Parts needed to make	A whole	3.0
Sophia how many do we have	One	3.0
Thank you	What if I dont want to take it down	0.0
I know	Jonah stop breaking  the law	0.0
Jonah stop breaking  the law	Are you starting right now	0.0
Were starting right now	Jonahs breaking the law	0.0
Jonahs breaking the law	Hes still playing	0.0
Asher	Miss	0.0
Yeah	Im hungry	0.0
are you ready	Yeah Im ready	0.0
Thats why were labeling so we remember what an ordered pair is	Ms Reeves	0.0
You remember	Ms Reeves	0.0
Ordered pairs are always in parentheses	I remember that	0.0
The whole thing	So wait	0.0
So in this case	Its seven and then negative 55	3.0
Point to B for us	This one is B and is negative eight	3.0
Just to remind ourselves	Four	3.0
And then what quadrant is this one	Two	3.0
Whats the ordered pair Aiden	Three and four	3.0
So the ordered pair is positive positive so what quadrant is this	One	3.0
D	This one and its negative 35 and 02	3.0
Just to make you keep that in mind	B	3.0
Sarah what did you get	Day 14	3.0
And what would you say is that amount		3.0
Do you think that makes sense	Yeah	1.0
Go ahead	It looks like its about negative 80	3.0
On what day		3.0
So here its day 14 or day 11 and like Franclin said the estimate would be maybe 80	No negative	3.0
Anyone disagree or agree with what we have so far or have questions	S	0.0
S	S	0.0
Yeah	S stands for no	0.0
Did Sarahs dot right here follow her point	11 negative 80	3.0
So what does the point  six negative 50 tell you about the account balance	They spent something	3.0
They spent something	They spent money on something	3.0
They spent money on something	A lot of money	1.0
I think this is what it means overall	Sorry I tripped on the cord	0.0
Just go get  no big deal	This stuff came out	0.0
This stuff came out	Do you have a broom	0.0
Oh I dont but theyll come and vacuum tomorrow	Sorry	0.0
They did not spend 5000 on that day	They spent way more than that	3.0
How do you know	Because it goes from 250 275 down	4.0
Yes	Negative 50	3.0
So how much money did they have on day five	A lot	3.0
A lot more right		3.0
Right here we had on day five they have 275	Oh	0.0
So really were thinking okay if we		3.0
So if at six negative 50 this really just says this means on the sixth day	They spent too much money	3.0
There was a chRiver in 32500	Thats a lot	3.0
So if we think about someones bank account over time and Im just going to do the dots here and plot this over time and it tells the story	It goes  like a heartbeat that goes	0.0
From 350 down to 275  how much did they spend between day three and day four	Way more than they should have	3.0
Way more than they should have	Zero dollars	3.0
How much is that	7500	3.0
7500	I thought you were saying	0.0
Electricity bill	Rent	3.0
Going from negative 50 to 100		3.0
Why would you gain 15000	A loan	3.0
A loan	Working	1.0
What was that	Maybe it was a paycheck	3.0
So theyre just plateaued right there	And then they spend too much money	3.0
Going from 100 to negative 80		3.0
	No	1.0
No		1.0
		1.0
Yes so they spent 18000 which again  could be groceries or something totally necessary	Why did I say 20	2.0
Oh well you were thinking of the difference between 100 and 80	They spent 20	3.0
Right here they have	Gas	3.0
Gas	A lot	1.0
A lot	Paycheck	1.0
Its plus 32500	It took them 14 days	3.0
It took them 14 days	It only took them 14 days to get out of debt	1.0
It only took them 14 days to get out of debt	It took them 14 days to move the 2500 properly	1.0
How can we interpret absolute value of negative 50 in this  case	Zero to peak	3.0
Zero to peak	Well that would be 130	3.0
What does the absolute value tell us	Its 5000 below zero	3.0
What does that mean	Its 15 below zero	3.0
Its 15 below zero	I mean 50	3.0
I mean 50	Thats what I said	1.0
Thats what I said	I said it and then you said it	1.0
I said it and then you said it	Whats that one  negative 51	2.0
Whats that one  negative 51	Thats absolute value	1.0
Thats absolute value	Oh	0.0
Okay it doesnt have  a direction	So zero	3.0
Well it has a value but the negative the absolute value of negative 50 equals 50	Im smart	0.0
Im smart	I said it right before you	0.0
I said it right before you	Your brain is	0.0

Ms Reeves can I take a photo	Can I take a photo	0.0
3A equals 12	Quadrant 12 minus 14	3.0
So  that opposite operation is  14 negative and  did you get  to an answer	Where should I put your recording thing	0.0
Did you get an answer Alexander	Yes	0.0
Yes	I already did them	0.0
I already did them	Its 491	3.0
So is that 2A again	2B	0.0
2B	Ms Reeves may I use the restroom	0.0
All right then	Since the  right next to the thing whatever	0.0
Once I see it Im like Oh yeah	Calculator	0.0
I love that youre trying its coefficient	Oh yeah	0.0
Yeah	Well since its right next to	0.0
Yeah	So in opposite operations it would be 64 divided by two	3.0
You got it	And I got 32	3.0
Nice	Can we have a cooldown	0.0
Or of course you may do work for other classes and that type of thing	Can I see my grade on my retake	0.0
Asher do you have that open	Yeah	0.0
Your first assessment	I realized that a little  bit later	0.0
I think I saw that I hadnt graded yours	Mine is graded	0.0
Also if you are done with everything I have a four quadrant mystery drawing if anybody	Ill do it	0.0
Ill do it	I want to do it	0.0
Yeah those are fun	Can I see this	0.0
Its just like this and it just gives you You have to figure out what the drawing is	I love those drawings	0.0

Yeah and then if you dont get picked up then	Ill  just have my backpack	0.0
Theres definitely some math going on here	Math	0.0
You have an idea Julia	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You can add the numbers but not the 400	3.0
What numbers	The 89 and 163 and 88	3.0
Why would we add those	So we could see how many he has so far	3.0
So we could see how many he has so far	And we can see how much he needs	3.0
Is that your pencil	He ripped my pencil	0.0
Nobody got 340 when they added them on up	I know I did	0.0
Miguel what am I going to do next	You have to add a number that makes 400	3.0
What are you thinking Owen		3.0
How did you get 60	Because six plus four equals 10	4.0
Did anybody have a different strategy	Nope	1.0
James you had another strategy	You can just do 400 minus 340	3.0
What did we get		3.0
Chloe you want to read it	Yeah	0.0

And how many stories was that		3.0
Whats the next one	The Empire State	3.0
And how many stories was that		3.0
And my last building	American Tower	3.0
And how much was that		3.0
What is it asking me to do	To add	3.0
Alison what is the actual question say	How many stories did he climb in all	0.0
In all tells us we want to do what James	We want to add them all up and whatever we get is the answer	3.0
Ella whatd you get		3.0
Carrie whatd you get	I got 464	3.0
Whatd you get	I got 314	3.0
Eight plus two is		3.0
Nathan what does it say	Terrell climbed four buildings for a total of 472 stories	0.0
And whats the next sentence say	It says He climbed the Burj Khalifa 163 stories	0.0
It says He climbed the Burj Khalifa 163 stories	The Abroad  120 stories	0.0
The Abroad  120 stories	The Taipei 101 stories in Taiwan 101 stories	0.0

How tall was building number two		3.0
How tall was building number three		3.0
And how tall was building number four		3.0
David what are you thinking	Add	3.0
What would you add	The 10	3.0
Chloe what do you think	I think we should all of them together and what they want for the answer is what that will equal	3.0
Do you agree	Yes	1.0
Yes	No	1.0
What do you think James	I went ahead and added it all up	3.0
I went ahead and added it all up	I didnt go  equals 472	3.0
No Chloe says If I add these up then thats the answer	Its not	1.0
Why do you say that	Because theres all the other big numbers	4.0
Because theres all the other big numbers	If you added all that up and got an answer then that number is huge	4.0
If you added all that up and got an answer then that number is huge	Get that as the answer  because the other building cant be that big because if we added all that stuff together itll be way more than 472	4.0
What does the question say	To figure out how many stories is in the last building	0.0
Nathan what do you think	Its 205	3.0
Julia	By adding them	3.0
Do we know how tall building number one is	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Do we know how tall building number two	Yes	0.0
Do we know how to tall building number three	Yes	0.0
This is what we need to find out	Theyre asking me to add it and make it into a number	3.0
James what do you think	We can add number one number two number three numbers and then we do 472 minus that	4.0
We can add number one number two number three numbers and then we do 472 minus that	And then that would be	0.0
Three plus zero plus one is	Four	3.0
Six plus two is	Eight	3.0
One plus one plus one	Three	3.0
Is this our answer	No	0.0
Chloe	384 plus 472 maybe	3.0
I want to find out what this is		3.0
James what am I going to do	Youre going to do 472 minus 384	3.0
Do I have to do some training	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Can I do two minus four	No	0.0
Can I do 12 minus four	Yes	0.0

Can I do 16 minus eight	Yes	0.0
Whats three minus three	Zero	3.0
Questions	No	0.0
So the title youre writing on your page today is square numbers	Uhoh	0.0
Its just a microphone thatll pick up because were recording okay	Okay	0.0
Should have been pretty big in third grade	Oh I remember how to do this in	0.0
Do you remember hearing the word	No	0.0
No	Yes	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	In Con Academy	0.0
Let me draw a picture of one and you tell me what you think	I forgot about it	0.0
I forgot about it	Its been so long	0.0
Its been so long	Oh yeah	0.0
Yup yup	Thats a three by three array	3.0
Its a three by three array	Oh yeah now I remember	0.0
Okay you might have labeled this a three by three right	And actually what labels are is easy	0.0
Is that starting to look a little bit more familiar	Yeah mmhmm	0.0
Now if I asked you how many dots were in there	Three times three	3.0
Okay so how many dots are in there	Nine	3.0
So maybe something like this	Three times three is nine	3.0
So an array is really just a fancy way to start thinking about multiplication	Mmhmm	0.0
Have you heard of multiplication before	Yes	0.0
Okay great raise your hand if youve heard of multiplication before	In my math lessons	3.0
Okay	Imagine	3.0
And youve heard it in Imagine	Mmhmm	0.0
Did you hear it last year	Yes	0.0
So now you were still in third grade last year right	Yeah	0.0
What you did here is multiplication right	Mmhmm	0.0
Okay	Multiplication is when you multiply a number with another number	3.0
How did you figure out how many dots were here	Added like three groups of three	3.0
Did anybody else do that	Yeah	1.0
And then what did you do	Count them	3.0
Count them	Then add it	1.0
Counted how	By threes	3.0
Lets think about another array	Yay	0.0
And then tell me what youre doing okay	Ooh	0.0
Ooh	Thats a big dot right there	0.0
Alan	Five	3.0
How many dots do I have going down	Five	3.0
Owen	Five	3.0
So how many dots are there		3.0
Ricardo what do you think	Counting by five	3.0
Okay so five	15 20 25	3.0
Olando whatd you do	I did	0.0
Okay	I did was count how many dots were there first and then count how many groups they were then I knew there was five then I counted five again because it was five in total	4.0
I did was count how many dots were there first and then count how many groups they were then I knew there was five then I counted five again because it was five in total	And I knew five times five was 25	4.0
Am I going to get the same answer	Yeah	0.0
Im adding up five groups of	Five	3.0
Are you following me	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Arrays are my favorite	0.0
Arrays are my favorite	Five by 25	3.0
Are we ready	Yeah	0.0
Okay are you sure	Yeah	0.0
Okay what kind of array is that	Two by three	3.0
How many dots are there	Four	3.0
Did you have to count them	No	0.0
Hm did you even have to count by twos	No	0.0
No thats one of those patterns those dot patterns that were really used to seeing right	Yeah	0.0
When I think of this if I were to connect these dots  sit up what shape would I get	Square	3.0
Do we agree	Yes	0.0
What kind of array is this	A three by three	3.0
This is a three by three	The one that we did in the first place	3.0
If I connected my dots and I drew perfectly would this also be a square	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
Lets do What kind of array is this	Four by four	3.0
Would you say if connected that this would also make a square	Yes	0.0
How many dots are here	Two	3.0
Two	Four	1.0
How many dots are here	Nine	3.0
How many dots are here		3.0
16 dots right	And theres another square in the middle of it	3.0
A million by a million	What	0.0
What	A trillion by sixtillion	0.0
So that when I go ahead and turn it into a square or put it into an array and close it up I actually get	A square	3.0
Are you following me	Yes	0.0
Julia how do they connect	The dots are the groups you times your groups	3.0
How is multiplication related to addition	You can solve multiplication by using division	3.0
Not division	No I mean you can solve multiplication using addition	3.0
Its just repeated addition right	Yeah	0.0
Its like us adding a group plus a group plus a group plus a group right	Yeah	0.0
Is there something else were really good at counting by	I can count by twos	3.0
Can you guys count by two	Yeah	0.0
Two	four six eight 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24	3.0
Thats something weve been practicing for a while right	Yes	0.0
Owen	Fives	3.0
By fives okay we did fives	Tens	3.0
We did twos we did fives	We can do six	3.0
What		3.0
Tens can you count by tens	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100	3.0
So thats skip counting do you remember them calling it skip counting	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	0.0
You guys used skip counting when you were thinking of the threes right	Yeah	0.0
We could skip count by sevens if we wanted to right	We could skip count by 10 quintillion	3.0
Were probably not memorized as well but if we did seven it would say seven and then		3.0
14 and then		3.0
21 and then		3.0
Four	Eight 16	3.0
12		3.0
You ready to try some work on your own	Yeah	0.0
These two numbers that were using to determine our array theyre called factors	Oh yeah	0.0
I dont know what page it is	What page	0.0
I dont know	Oh I found it	0.0
What page	I just passed it	0.0
Were looking at lesson 21	I found it	0.0
Page 35	35	0.0
All right on page 35 are you	No not yet	0.0
No not yet	I got it	0.0
	Found it	0.0
What was the next	A one by one	3.0
No they already showed us one by one two by two three by three four by four	Five by five	3.0
Five by five and the one after that would be	Six by six	3.0
They just want you	To do a square	3.0
But go ahead and peek at page 36	Wait which page	0.0
Penelope what were we making with arrays	Square numbers	3.0
One four nine 16 25 36 49 these all square number right	Mmhmm	0.0
Carrie	A number	3.0
What is it	A factor	3.0
So we definitely looked at a three by three array right	Yes	0.0
Part of it because we know that three times three equals what	Nine	3.0
Are you following me	Yeah	0.0
So now ah drive me crazy	can we still write that on our paper	0.0
Well yeah but you should be writing  paper right	Mmhmm	0.0
Do you agree	Yes	0.0
Julia what would you do	Count them by fives	3.0
How many groups of five do we need in this case	Five	3.0
So five times five is		3.0
Did I have to count dots	No	0.0
Did I have to count boxes	No	0.0
Columns times rows gives me the area	Miss	0.0
Give you one more minute	Miss	0.0
Okay	How I did it	0.0
How I did it	So I just	0.0
So you were counting by what number	Five	3.0
Or we could look at this as seven groups of five five plus five plus five plus five plus five	Or five groups of seven	3.0
Whats five times seven		3.0
	Oh Im just close	0.0
Oh Im just close	Im very close	0.0
If you think Im only 20 then	Miss  youre like 30 something	0.0
Miss  youre like 30 something	No shes probably at least	0.0
No shes probably at least	Youre 20	0.0
Youre 20	No shes 27	0.0
No shes 27		0.0
So lets try a different one are you ready	Okay	0.0
You ready	Yeah	0.0
Julia has requested that we wait one more minute	Okay	0.0
Owen what was your strategy	I counted by two	3.0
Why did you count by twos	Because it was  number	0.0
Because it was  number	So I counted by twos	3.0
Mila what did you do	Count by 10s	3.0
Is there a right way or a wrong way	No	0.0
What answer did you get		3.0
Two four six eight 10 12 14 16 18 20	Two four six eight 10 12 14 16 18 20	0.0
10 20	10 20	0.0
10 20	Which ones easier	2.0
Which ones easier	Either way you got the same answer	3.0
Might be easier might be faster but either way thats the same answer right	Yeah	0.0
I like bananas	I like bananas too but I dont eat them	0.0
Are you ready	Yes	0.0
Are you sure	Yes	0.0
Yes	Im sure	0.0
No dont do that	Oh no what is she doing	2.0
Four by six	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thats kind of easy	0.0
Thats kind of easy	Thats kind of easy	0.0
Julia what did you do	I did	0.0
Ella what did you do	I counted by four	3.0
And I saw you you were writing things down werent you	Yeah	0.0
You said	Four	3.0
And then you did five six seven eight		3.0
And then she counted one two three four five six groups of four is		3.0
Now I would love love love love	Okay	0.0
We are less than 22 if that helps you to look for the page	Less than 22	0.0
Im going to put them on the board	Its 22	0.0
Its 22	22	0.0
22	We found it	0.0
We found it	Its just	0.0
Its just		0.0
		0.0
		0.0
	I am 37 already	0.0
	I already found it	0.0
So I have a five	Miss	0.0
whats my area		3.0
	Yes	0.0
Five 10 15 20 25 30 35 40	Five 10 15 20 25 30 35 40	0.0
Five 10 15 20 25 30 35 40	Yes	0.0
So I added one more group of five that gives me 40		0.0
How are we feeling	Good	0.0
Questions	No	0.0
So yesterday what did we talk about	We talked about factors	3.0
We talked about factors	All the rainbows	1.0
Eleanor	We talked about a rainbow	3.0
Carrie	Factor pairs	3.0
Ben	So a factor is just something to  its just a part of a number	3.0
So a factor is a part of a number	And a factor pair is the two numbers combined to make the number	3.0
Eleanor you want to try	I wanted to say that	1.0
Carrie	A factor pair is the multiplication and the factors are just the numbers you use in the multiplication	3.0
So a factor pair are the two specific numbers that we have to combine to get that  Whats the answer to a multiplication problem	The product	3.0
For 56 hopefully you know one factor pair	I do too	0.0
Diego	Seven times eight equals 56	3.0
Eleanor	One times 56	3.0
What is it	Even	3.0
Is two a factor	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Diego what is it	Two times 28	3.0
What about three is three a factor	Yes	0.0
What about four	Yes	0.0
Four and what		3.0
What about six	Five and 11	3.0
Eleanor	Seven times eight	3.0
And then we know were done because we touch the middle of our rainbow	Can I go to the bathroom please	0.0
Chloe	One and 56	3.0
Diego	One two four seven eight 13 28 56	3.0
Audrey what would be a factor pair	Two and 28	3.0
Whats another factor pair Chloe	One and 56	3.0
Whats another factor pair Nathan	Four and 13	3.0
Whats another factor pair Grace	Seven and three	3.0
How many factor pairs does 56 have	Four	3.0
How many factors does 56 have	Eight	3.0
Okay you got the factors	Yes	0.0
You ready	Yeah	0.0
Ill give you a chance to get that written in your notebook	Do we have to write the whole thing	0.0
I have to ask have you heard it before	No	0.0
Never heard of multiples before	No	0.0
Thats funny because Ive already talked about it	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
David what do you think	Adding	3.0
Chloe	Something with subtracting	3.0
Something with subtracting	Okay	0.0
Okay	Something thats multiple	3.0
Diego	Maybe its something thats adding	3.0
Where we learned counting by one that was probably the first thing we learned was ones right	One two three four five	0.0
And she always gets stuck when she needs to go from 39 like what comes after 39 because we switch	Four	3.0
We know that	Yeah	0.0
After we figured out how to count by ones we probably started counting by	A hundred	3.0
Right	10 20 30 40 50 60	3.0
We counted by fives	5 10 15 20 25	3.0
We counted by twos	Two four six eight 10	3.0
Skip counting sometimes we call it right	Yes	0.0
Yes	Mmhmm	1.0
So if were talking about multiples of two we would have	Two four six eight 10 12	3.0
This is really two times one two times two two times three	Two times four two times five two times six	3.0
Okay give me multiples of five	5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50	3.0
Are you following me	Yes	0.0
Right now  Do you have a question James	Well Im just saying if its an even number that were looking for its two times something and you just have to cut the number in half	3.0
So right now knowing that these are what multiples are I want you to give me the first five multiples of seven	Oh gosh	0.0
Ill give you a hint this one	Its seven	3.0
Julia what did you do	I counted seven and then eight and then	3.0
Chloe what did you do	I just knew	3.0
Okay you just know counting by seven	Not all of them but most of them	3.0
Nathan	I counted by seven	3.0
Okay	I counted by ones	3.0
Ella what did you do	I counted by seven	3.0
Julia		3.0
Whats next Eleanor		3.0
Whats next Julia		3.0
Nathan whats the last one		3.0
Is seven a factor of 35	Yeah	0.0
You ready to do one more	Yeah	0.0
Whats the first multiple of nine	Nine	3.0
Whats next		3.0
	27 36 49 54	3.0
Remember nines has that pattern do you remember that nines have that pattern	Yeah	0.0
All right how do you feel about multiples	Good	0.0
Its going to be 40something	Is it 45	0.0
So we would start and	20 30 40 50	3.0
Easy enough	Is this the right page	0.0
Did it tell you they have to be in order	No	0.0
Now it wants you to give the multiples for the factor	The numbers	3.0
Do you understand what they want you to do	Mmhmm	0.0
Are you ready	Okay	0.0
Yeah	Okay	0.0
Oh I thought there was a multiple one	There is	0.0
There is	Theres another one	0.0
Theres another one	I think there is	0.0
I think there is	Yeah there is	0.0
So Im sure I want to go big right	Yeah	0.0
So Im going to do nine and 10 because nine times 10 is		3.0
Lets see what do you think I should do	Eight times seven	3.0
Ooh eight times seven we know that one	It equals 56	3.0
Now this is the product right what are the balloons called	Factors	3.0
Sweet		3.0
Whats the biggest I can make		3.0
Six times two which is what		3.0
	What	0.0
Lets hear your multiple of six	Try again	0.0
I cant make a larger product	Miss did you notice that always the computer gets to the right number	3.0
Is the computer always right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Theres a button	3.0
I do want you to check with Mrs Horton	I passed the lesson appropriately	0.0
Then youre fine	I passed a lesson	0.0
Everybody know what theyre doing	Yes	0.0
Matteo whats your answer		3.0
Tell me how you got 17	I just added 9 plus 8 and got 17	4.0
Why did you add nine plus eight	Because I saw since 8 more so I thought it was talking about adding	4.0
Eight plus nine is		3.0
This on a scale of one to five one being achieving mass problem five being a challenging math problem where would you put this	Easy	0.0
I know that nine times eight is		3.0
Do we really know what Daren read	No	0.0
Could I put those number sentences together	Yes	0.0
So we could take this information and we could replace this J with what	Eight eight eight	3.0
Now could we figure out how much Daren read	Yes	0.0
Sam	40 books	3.0
Daren read 40 books	Yeah	0.0
Could we combine them again	Yes	0.0
Owen what are you thinking		3.0
So four times three is		3.0
Do you think you understand how to pull this number sentence out of a number story	Yes	0.0
I dont know if we use her chalk to draw a line  Diegos line was 36 feet long	Wait what page is it	0.0
Wait what page is it		0.0
Do we know what the D is	Yeah	0.0
But how much is it worth		3.0
Do we know how many times the line is	No	0.0
So thats going to say do we know how Shares line is	Yes	0.0
How long		3.0
Six equals 36 James	Six times six	3.0
Six times six	Its a square number	3.0
What	What is 2 times 18	2.0
So you think you can handle this	Yes	0.0
Miguel	We were finding we were doing multiplication with multiple numbers	3.0
Chloe	Multiplication  multiplication	3.0
Aria what did we call it	Multiplication facts	3.0
No	Extended multiplication facts	3.0
Do you remember this	Yes	0.0
Nathan	then when you finished it  like a big number	3.0
What would you do	You would just since you have 40 since its an even number	4.0
You would just since you have 40 since its an even number	You would just add 20	4.0
Miguel what do you think	You add four times two and then when youre done with that you add the zeros	4.0
Do we know what four times two is	Eight	3.0
How many zeros do I have here	Two	3.0
How many zeros do I need here	Two	3.0
Whatd you get	3500	3.0
Five times seven is		3.0
Plus how many zeros	Two	3.0
Do we remember this stuff	Yes	0.0
Whos ever watched wrestling been to a wrestling match any of that stuff	I watched it on YouTube	0.0
In order to wrestle here we have to have just one person against one person	My brother goes to Northland High School	0.0
Nicole	But he got in quarantine	0.0
Did he	My brother my brother goes to Northland also	0.0

Im going to hand out a paper and then were going to play a little game	Another game to play	0.0
Now were going to play blue	Lets play multiplication wrestling	0.0
Lets play multiplication wrestling	Here we go	0.0
Here we go	Use the numbers to find two two digit numbers that will get the highest possible product when multiplied	0.0
If you look at the top	two digit numbers	0.0
In those four spots I want you to write the numbers one five three and nine	One five	3.0
One five	Three and nine	3.0
We could say 15 times 39 or we could arrange those cards to make other numbers	Ive got an idea	0.0
Okay James whats your idea	91 and 53	3.0
Okay why do you say 91 and 53	Those are the highest possible numbers you can make	3.0
Those are the highest possible numbers you can make	Youre putting in	0.0
Now	Create two teams by showing each number as a sum of tens and ones	0.0
90 and	One	3.0
one and over here for 50 and three we would it break that into	Five and three	3.0
You following me	Complete the right multiplication sentence for  each of the four products	0.0
Whats nine times five		3.0
45 with how many zeros	Two	3.0
Whats nine times three		3.0
And how many zeros	One	3.0
Whats one times 50		3.0
One times what	Three	3.0
times three whats one times three	Three	3.0
Three	Enter the total	0.0
What did we get as our answer	4723  4 823	3.0
4823	Yes	0.0
Does everybody agree	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	This total is your new high product	0.0
This total is your new high product	Congratulations	0.0
Congratulations	Use the numbers to form two two digit numbers that will give the highest possible product when multiplied	0.0
Now were going to	your two two digit numbers	0.0
How are we feeling	Good	0.0
We okay to play this game for a little bit	Yeah	0.0
All right	Lets do it	0.0
What ever were we doing	Multiplication wrestling	3.0
Okay what is multiplication wrestling	Its when you take two numbers andtwo numbers that have two digits	3.0
Okay	and you put on the 10s on the ones and then the 10 wrestles all the other numbers and the one wrestles	3.0
What are we actually doing	Were putting two numbers like the one thats going to wrestle the other ones like	3.0
What are we doing	Multiplying	3.0
Whats a product	Two factors	3.0
Right whats a product	The answer	3.0
David	Like some of it	3.0
So if I give you this 35 times 62 could you find an answer to this	Yes	0.0
Do you have the tools now to find an answer to this	Yes	0.0
Penelope what would I do first	Separate the 30 from the five and put 30	3.0
Penelope said you have 30 and whats our other one	Five	3.0
Nathan	Pull them apart 60 and two	3.0
Nathan do you think you know	Um yeah	0.0
Okay	I think that its you said they was wrestling it would wrestle the 30 maybe might wrestle the 60	3.0
But how do I know how many wrestling matches Im going to make	Because youre going to wrestle 30 and 6 30 is going to wrestle 60 so thats one	4.0
Or I did this quickly so Im not surprised you dont remember but how many digits do I have here	Two	3.0
Two	Two times two	1.0
So in this case its two times two and how much is that	Four	3.0
Do you remember that little piece now	Yes	0.0
Nathan you think you know my first combination	30 and 60	3.0
Jacob	30 times two	3.0
Louise	We can add three times six and then when you get the answer to three times six you add two zero because	4.0
Okay so what is three times six		3.0
Whats three times two		3.0
How many zeros	One	3.0
So whos next	The fives	3.0
Whos the five going to wrestle with	The two	3.0
The two	Six	1.0
And then whos five going to wrestle	Two	3.0
All done	I already did the whole thing	0.0
Do we know five times six	Mmhmm	0.0
Whats five times six		3.0
	Its200	1.0
Whats five times two		3.0
		1.0
Now what do we do	Add them all in total	3.0
Add them all in total	Youre forgetting something	1.0
Youre forgetting something	Zero	3.0
What am I forgetting	at the end of 60	3.0
What	Zero at the end of 60 you didnt wait oh	3.0
Zero at the end of 60 you didnt wait oh	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Sorry	0.0

Six plus one is	Seven	3.0
Seven		1.0
Eight and three		3.0
2170 is what I got	I got it right	0.0
Did we find the answer to a multiplication problem	Yes	0.0
All right how far did you get	I got like the first step	3.0
Chloe	I split up 27 and 95	3.0
What did you break 27 up to look like	20 and seven	3.0
And 95	90 and five	3.0
Penelope	So I did two times two	3.0
Chloe	Two times nine	3.0
You did what	Two times nine	3.0
Jacob help her out	20 times 90	3.0
Okay so we did 20 times 90 what would be our next combination	20 times five	3.0
Jacob	Seven times 90	3.0
Okay next	Seven times five	3.0
Everybody caught up	Hey Miss Im seeing that only 20 and seven are wrestling	3.0
So theyre never going to wrestle each other you dont want to take out your teammate	No theyre only wrestling 90 and five but 90 and 95 are not wrestling to make seven	3.0
All right are you ready	Yes	0.0
Two times nine is		3.0
With how many zeros	Two	3.0
Whats two times five		3.0
With how many zeros	Two	3.0

And seven times five		3.0
Now what	Add them together	3.0
Zero zero zero and five gives us	Five	3.0
Zero zero three and three	Six	3.0
Eight plus one is nine plus six is		3.0
15 and one plus one is	Two	3.0
Two		1.0
	Yes	0.0

Do you want a tough one	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes please	0.0
Something tricky	86 and 46	3.0
See how far you can go	Oh my gosh	0.0
Am I right	Yeah	0.0
Because you dont know	The answer	3.0
If you knew your basic facts this would be real easy right	Yeah	0.0
David whats the first combination you did		3.0
Times what	I had the zeros and I put eight times nine	3.0
I had the zeros and I put eight times nine	Im so confused	2.0
Im so confused	No that was wrong	3.0
No that was wrong	I did eight times four	3.0
So we have the 80 times 40 and then what do we have	80 times nine	3.0
80 times nine	And then six times 30 40	3.0
And then six times 30 40	six times nine	3.0
Whats eight times four		3.0
	No its 30	1.0
No its 30	Damn it	0.0
32	Mmhmm	0.0

Yeah like the angel	360	0.0
Why Chloe	Because I think I messed up on the	3.0
Tell me loud Chloe	I	0.0
I	I think I did most of it right but the thing got stuck on is 10 times the number but 10 times plus five plus 90	3.0
So you know the process you messed up on the multiplication	Yeah and then I did five times 25 one four one times four and one times 20	4.0
Okay I want you to take out your multiplication chart	Its already out	0.0
All right lets get out math journals and Ill give you your assignment for today	Addison do you forgive me	0.0
I dont know how I messed this up but now all my titles are gone again	Again	0.0
I didnt do anything	Shut down your whole entire computer then turn it back on again	0.0
Shut down your whole entire computer then turn it back on again	Thats what made it work last time	0.0
Audrey you might need to leave and come back and see if that helps	Wait I couldnt find that one	0.0
Yeah it was the very first one it was called Which do you like best and why	I never found it	0.0
Yeah Charlie	So what couldve used a little bit of work was number two that it couldve been a little bit more neater so we could understand	3.0
So what couldve used a little bit of work was number two that it couldve been a little bit more neater so we could understand	And what could work a little bit more was also number one is to not shake the paper a lot all over so it could see better	3.0
It was blurry that one was definitely hard to see huh	Yeah	0.0
Do you see answers in number two	Yes	0.0
Do I see some work	Yes	0.0
Do I se evidence of work	Yes	0.0
Do I know where the final answer is	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Because I see an answer here and here and here and here and here and here and here	And also we dont know what the question is asking	3.0
Yeah Stanley	Hello Maam	0.0
Hello Maam	I forgot because I was talking to my mom	0.0
How much money will he have left after he buys the books	What was the number again	2.0
What was the number again	You read a little bit too fast	0.0
The number of what	Of after we write Mr	0.0
Of after we write Mr	Swanson	0.0
He has 350 to spend	Okay	0.0
Okay	350 to spend	0.0
Oh can you guys not see it	No	0.0
There you go now can you see it	Yeah	0.0
Natalie if you have me pinned you wont be able to see what Im presenting	One second	0.0
You dont have to have the problem solved but I would like to see a start of something		0.0
I need everyone to turn on their camera and show me what youve done so far	I was writing the question	0.0
You dont have to rewrite the entire question again	I made a little box at the bottom of my paper and thats where my work is	0.0
Natalie are you showing anything	Yeah I just did	0.0
Emery Lucy	I already showed mine	0.0
So they gave him a budget of 350	I cant see your board	0.0
Charlie what do you think	What I think is I think that were going to do five times six or 10 times six	3.0
Okay why do you think that	Because I think we could do one of those two five times six or 10 times six because each ones costs 10 but theres five How many books there is in a package theres five of those	4.0
Because I think we could do one of those two five times six or 10 times six because each ones costs 10 but theres five How many books there is in a package theres five of those	So I think we should do one of the two 10 times six or five times six	4.0
Okay well go Lucy and then well go Valentina	50 times six because theres five package of 10 and we count by 10s it would be 50	4.0
So you want to do 50 times six	Yes	0.0
What do you think	I was going to do the same thing 50 times six because when you add the 10s its 50	4.0
I was going to do the same thing 50 times six because when you add the 10s its 50	So each packet is going to have 50 in it	4.0
So each packet is going to have 50 in it	So 50 times six	4.0
Anybody		3.0
So how much money did he spend on books		3.0
Whats the next step	Well we know that we spent 300 which is up there so I think we will have to subtract 300 and 350	3.0
How much money does he have left		3.0
I hope he doesnt need to make any other big purchases because	Also something that we could do is that if we know that its 300 right here it has 50 so we could just take the three off and we know that we would get 50 but we need to always get that answer that we always have	3.0
Questions about this problem before we move on	No	0.0
Thanks Wallace	Was it 137	0.0
Natalie will you read it for me	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	The second one	0.0
The first one	Danielle and Hector are selling raffle tickets to raise money for the school band	0.0
Danielle and Hector are selling raffle tickets to raise money for the school band	Danielle sells five tickets per day for four weeks straight then she sells four tickets per day for one week	0.0
Danielle sells five tickets per day for four weeks straight then she sells four tickets per day for one week	How many tickets does Hector need to sell if he wants to sell more tickets than Danielle	0.0
Does it say anything about how many ticket Hector sells	No	0.0
Any ideas	I have one	0.0
Okay whats your idea	So first we could do five times seven because theres seven days in a week	4.0
Okay	Then do that times four	3.0
Then do that times four	Then we have the answer to five tickets a day for four weeks	3.0
So if we multiply this times seven because theres seven days in a week then we could take that answer and multiply it by four	Yeah	0.0
So what is five times seven		3.0
Valentina what do you think	I think that you should do four times seven	3.0
Why four times seven	Because each day in a week theres seven days in a week and she sells four a day	4.0
Yeah	Four tickets a day	3.0
What is four times seven		3.0
		1.0
		1.0
Are we done	No	0.0
Toby do you think you know what we do	Add up the answers we got	3.0
So whats 140 plus 28	168	3.0
So do you mind if I erase this	Yeah	0.0
She sold four tickets a day for one week	Do we write all of that	0.0
If you have your other work this is fine Im just trying to wrap it all up in a cute little bow for us	Okay	0.0
Were going to do	Were going to do two	0.0
Yep were going to do number two right now	All of it together	0.0

Addison	Yes Maam	0.0
Abel are you still with us	Yes	0.0
Stella	Yes Im still here	0.0
What did you do first	What I did first is 12 times four	3.0
Why 12 times four Lucy	Because theres	0.0
Because theres	Wait is there eggs there	0.0
I would do the exact same ting I just wanted to hear you explain it a little bit more	Miss	0.0
Miss	What I would do	0.0
Let Lucy finish explaining and then well move to you	Oh okay	0.0
Okay	I said 12 times four because there are four eggs and then I did twelve times four and then it equaled 48	4.0
Natalie what are you thinking	I thought since theres 365 days in a year I thought if I do 12 of 365 days Id maybe get the answer	3.0
Youre	Maybe times	3.0
Whats four times 10		3.0
Whats four times two	Eight	3.0
Eight	Eight	1.0
40 plus eight is		3.0
I think she really likes eggs what do you think	I like eggs also	0.0
Are we done here	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
Now what	Add them all together	3.0
We only have 48 eggs a month	Yeah but we didnt add four times 12 four times 10 and four times two then then add them all together	4.0
So we got four times 10 is 40 four times two is eight we got 48	Yeah but you forgot one question	3.0
Whats that	Four times 10	3.0
Right here	Oh	0.0
We know how many eggs she eats in a month but we want to know how many in a year	Wait maybe 48 more	3.0
Valentina what do you think	I think its 48	3.0
I think its 48	You can do 48 times 12	1.0
Why 48 times 12	Because theres 12 months in a year	4.0
You following me	Yeah	0.0
All right	Yeah	0.0
How many eggs is she eating in a year	Do we type our answers in the gap	0.0
Whoa	I could just double my answer	3.0
Does anybody agree with me	Yes	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Anybody else	You joking	0.0
You joking	I got that right too	0.0
I got that right too	I got that right	0.0
I got that right	If you add it all together you get that	3.0
If you add it all together you get that	Its that exact answer	3.0
And because we wanted two years we did 576 plus 576 and we got our final answer of 1152 eggs	I got it right	0.0
Dont leave the Meet stay in but go ahead and take a 10 minute break	Do I need to send this to you	0.0
Will you please put it down	Its off	0.0
You turned it off	I didnt even touch it	0.0
I didnt even touch it	I need a pencil	0.0
I need a pencil	I didnt turn it off	0.0
Emma will you turn yours on	I turned them on but they turned back	0.0
What am I looking for	equal a thing	3.0
How else could you describe it huh	Equal fractions	3.0
Julia	One half	3.0
Miguel what are you thinking	Two fourths	3.0
And what would you do to this Miguel	Put a line in like this	3.0
Youd cut each of the pieces in half	Mmhmm	0.0
Do you agree	Yes	0.0
Same right	Yeah	0.0
Penelope	Three sixths	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Lets give everybody some think time now	I notice something awesome	0.0
I notice something awesome	I know the answer but Im not going to raise my hand because I want everyone else to have a chance	0.0
Owen whats something you notice about the fractions	On the bottom is two four six	4.0
On the bottom is two four six	Its counting up by twos	4.0
What do you see Matteo	I see that on the tops its counting one two three	3.0
Alejandro what do you see	I think Im noticing the numbers on the bottom one two three two four six	3.0
Miguel	I see that theyre still halves but theyre just cut in half	3.0
Nathan what do you notice	I think theyre still equal when you cut it in the half	3.0
I didnt change my amount at all did I	No	0.0
Audrey what do you notice	Pieces are getting smaller	3.0
Yeah whats happening to my denominator	Getting bigger	3.0
Ben what did we do	What we did is we just cut it one more time than what the one half is so basically its exactly the same	3.0
David how else could you explain it	We just added two	3.0
We just added two slices	Yeah	0.0
James	So really I figured out that if we halve the whole thing so one from half and halve it again	4.0
So really I figured out that if we halve the whole thing so one from half and halve it again	So if we halve it then we have to double one halves into two fourths	4.0
Yeah	So I actually had two strategies	0.0
Okay	So I used adding and multiplication because as you can see at the top of these two numbers it just goes one two but if you count by twos it actually gets here	4.0
What would you multiply two by to get four	Two fourths I think	3.0
Two fourths I think	Two times two	1.0
Do we agree	Yes	0.0
What would I get	Two	3.0
James	So I figured out that really theres another cheat too	0.0
Okay whats that	The other cheat is you just add one to the numerator and two to the denominator	4.0
The other cheat is you just add one to the numerator and two to the denominator	Two four six	4.0
Two four six	One two three	4.0
Is there a cheat we could use to get to this fraction	Yep	0.0
Did we double	Oh I see	0.0
Did we double	No	0.0
We went from one piece to how many	Three	3.0
Did we double	No	0.0
No	Yeah	1.0
What did we do	We tripled	3.0
Miguel	You can times three	3.0
You can times three	Yeah because triple means three	4.0
Yeah so if I multiply by three and I multiply by three what do I get	Three sixths	3.0
We made equivalent fractions by doing what	Multiplying	3.0
Are you ready	Yes	0.0
Write this down	This is the words of Samwise	0.0
Okay	What about multiplication	0.0
I said multiplication and division	Oh	0.0
Oh	I thought you said	0.0
Could you do more	Yep	0.0
Is it still equivalent	Uhhuh	0.0
So were saying one half is equal to four not six four whats	Eighths	3.0
Chloe	You can still count by twos just by getting to the eight and even if you go to the top where it says one and four I dont know what that counts by but I know it still counts by something	3.0
So what else do I write	By fours	3.0
Two times four is what	Eight	3.0
Eight	Two four six eight	3.0
And one times four is	Four	3.0
What did we multiply by	Were quadrupling it	3.0
We multiplied by four	Is that right	0.0
That is right	How is it working	2.0
So now lets look at this one	What happens	2.0
What happens	Im all of the sudden going	0.0
Im all of the sudden going	Wait is that Trent	0.0
I screwed that up	Is that five tenths	0.0
Hold on	I think you actually did twelfths	3.0
Do you see that I knew what I was doing and I actually didnt	Its okay	0.0
Three sixths is the same as one half we agree	Yes	0.0
What am I multiplying by right here	Six	3.0
What am I multiplying by	Six	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
You do to the top	So youre	0.0
So youre	I think its called quintupling the amount	3.0
Okay	I cant remember	0.0
Let me see how youre feeling	Double triple	0.0
Double triple	Amazing	0.0
Amazing	Amazing	0.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Whatever I do to the top	You do to the bottom	3.0
Okay	Miss  You put six tenths	3.0
Penelope what do you think	I think five	3.0
Five	Thats what I was going to say	1.0
Anybody else think five	Yes	1.0
Two times what	Five	3.0
Whatever I do to the bottom Whats one times five	One	3.0
One	Five	1.0
Thats pretty good right	Mmhmm	0.0
Remember the rule that whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top	0.0
Whats a fraction you came up with Nathan	Two sixths	3.0
Nathan what did you multiply by	Multiply	0.0
Did you use the rule	No	0.0
Chloe	Three	3.0
Miguel	Two	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Two	Oh yeah	0.0
Right	Yes	0.0
Matteo	Times three	3.0
What did you get for your fraction	Three on the top and nine on the bottom	3.0
James whats another one	I actually figured out something	0.0
Okay	So really you take the one third	4.0
So really you take the one third	Since its one third you add one to the numerator	4.0
Since its one third you add one to the numerator	Since its a third you add three to the denominator	4.0
Thats why I said its multiplication or division	Yeah but I realized if you want to go in order	3.0
What did you multiply by	Two	3.0
David	By three	3.0
By three	And by one	3.0
Penelope	One ninth	3.0
Penelope	Two eighths	3.0
Yeah	Two thirds	3.0
You didnt multiply the top and the bottom	Okay	0.0
What about this one	100 300	3.0
Whatever you do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Could we use any number	Yep	0.0
Yeah	You could do 7624	0.0
You could do 7624	You can do 2426	0.0
Because whatever we do to the bottom	We do to the top	3.0
Is this the first time youve  a piece of paper	No	0.0
Are we using pictures anymore	No	0.0
Because were multiplying	Done	0.0
So whats your new fraction	Four and twenty	3.0
Thats a good one huh	Ive got something	0.0
Matteo what did you get	Times two	3.0
Times two	Thats what I did	0.0
Thats what I did	Two on the top and 10 on the bottom	3.0
David	Five	3.0
Whats one times five	Five	3.0
And five times five		3.0
Chloe what do you multiply by	By six	3.0
By six	Or no	0.0
Whatever we do to the top	We do to the bottom	3.0
Which gives us		3.0
	So that wouldnt work	1.0
Ben	Four twentieths	3.0
So you did that one	And I times two that to get eight fortieths	3.0
Miguel	Times six	3.0
What is it	Times six	3.0
What do you get as your numerator	Six thirtieths	3.0
Miguel	Five	3.0
And I know that whatever I do to the bottom	I do to the top	3.0
So whats two times five	Ten	3.0
So my numerator is going to be	Ten	3.0
One times what Penelope	Four	3.0
Whatever I do to the top	You do to the bottom	3.0
What is nine times four		3.0
		1.0
	Thats also six times six	3.0
Its pretty easy right	Yes	0.0
Can we use addition and subtraction	No	0.0
When you are finished you are welcome to move to  Question	If were get stuck can we use all our notebook	0.0
That is always an option with math	I dont know how its possible but how am I getting better at math	0.0
Because you have the best math teacher in the world	Exactly	0.0
Owen what do you have	Twofourths	3.0
David	Foureighths	3.0
Foureighths	Sixtwelfths	1.0
James	Sevenfourteenths	3.0
Chloe	Eighteighteenths	3.0
Nathan	Eightsixteenths	3.0
Ben	I had eightsixteenths	3.0
Nathan what did you do	I just put everything into a percentage of	3.0
So how did you figure out these fractions	Well all of them are going to be the same because just have smaller pieces	4.0
David how did you figure it out	So I just used like one two and then	3.0
Oh Kevin what did you get	Threeninths	3.0
How did you get threeninths Kevin	Times three	3.0
Julia	Onesixth	3.0
What am I doing to three to get six	Three times two	3.0
Or one times two is one	Sorry twosixths	3.0
Chloe	Threethirds	3.0
James	1030ths	3.0
What did you multiple onethird by to get 1030s	10	3.0
Whatever I do to the top	Its an easy 10 multiplication	3.0
I do to the bottom	What about threefourths	3.0
What about what	Threefourths	3.0
Chloe what am I multiplying one by to get three	Two	3.0
Whatever I do to the top I do to the bottom whats three times three	Nine	3.0
How did you get that	Times four	3.0
Ben	I wrote quite a big number four commas in it	3.0
Okay	Not commas	0.0
Not commas	I dont know I dont remember what its called but I think it divides	3.0
I dont know I dont remember what its called but I think it divides	I dont remember exactly what theyre called because	2.0
Theyre commas	Okay I couldnt remember off the top of my head if that was right	0.0
Okay so you did lots of commas	Yeah like four commas	3.0
any number	No	0.0
Multiply it use the rule whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top because pictures are not always going to work	Can it also be in the hundreds	3.0
Miguel what did you get	200 500	3.0
What did you multiply it by	100	3.0
Kevin what did you get	Two	3.0
Fourfifths	Yeah	0.0
I started with two fifths	tenths	3.0
Chloe	Twotenths	3.0
Sorry what	Eight20ths	3.0
What did you multiply by to get eight20ths	I multiplied by four	3.0
David	20 over 50	3.0
What did he multiply by	10	3.0
Julia	I did 10 and 25	3.0
How much	10 and 25	3.0
What did you multiply by	I multiplied five times five and two times five	4.0
What did you get	400 100	3.0
Yeah you missed a zero	I did two billion five billion	3.0
Okay so you multiplied by a billion	Yeah	0.0
David	So do you just do any number	3.0
So whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Chloe did you have another question	No	0.0
Greater than less than equal to	Oh I know this	0.0
Diego what do you think	I think its onefifth	3.0
Onefifth is what	The bigger one	3.0
Why do you say that	onefifth is bigger	3.0
Okay	And it uses up more space	3.0
Penelope	Onefifth is bigger because how you said the bigger the denominator the smaller the pieces	4.0
So our slices are getting	Smaller	3.0
Ella what do you think	I think its	0.0
Why	Because twofifths smaller pieces	4.0
So if we were to look at this is that more or less than half	More	3.0
If we come over here Im only getting	You can always just go back and get more	0.0
Chloe do you have a question	twothirds equal because if you you get three and then six	4.0
twothirds equal because if you you get three and then six	Thats why I think theyre equal those are both the same number and equal	4.0
Thats why I think theyre equal those are both the same number and equal	If you multiply it by six	4.0
Are those equal	No	0.0
Whatever I do to the bottom	You do to the top	3.0
Okay so yes the number of pieces we get are the same but the size of our pieces are different	Very different	0.0
Kevin what do you think	Foursixths	3.0
You think foursixths is what	Bigger	3.0
Yes thats true but look at our denominators	Theyre both the same	3.0
Are my denominators the same or different	The same	3.0
what do you think	I think nine10ths because	3.0
Nine10ths because	You get nine pieces and six10ths you only get six pieces	4.0
Are my numerators the same	No	0.0
Are my denominators the same	No	0.0
Amy what do you think	Nine10ths	3.0
Why	Because theres more slices	4.0
Nathan	Its almost the same because still need to cut it right there in the middle	4.0
Its almost the same because still need to cut it right there in the middle	So nine	4.0
Is that what I heard Nathan	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I think its twothirds just because its like numerator or denominator	4.0
I think its twothirds just because its like numerator or denominator	It looks like its more pieces but the lower the denominator the bigger the piece gets	4.0
It looks like its more pieces but the lower the denominator the bigger the piece gets	So I think its twothirds	4.0
Were still just missing one slice but were missing a much smaller slice	Oh	0.0
Are you seeing that	Yeah	0.0
So if I were to think about one10th onethird which ones bigger	One10th	3.0
Are you following me	Basically whats happening is the numerator is bigger on the 10 so that means theres more pieces	4.0
Basically whats happening is the numerator is bigger on the 10 so that means theres more pieces	So basically whats happening slice thats missing on the but youre just missing one tiny slice versus	4.0
So of those three fractions which one do we get the smallest amount	One	3.0
Julia	Onehalf	3.0
David	Twothirds	3.0
Audrey	Nine10ths	3.0
Ill give you one more minute to think about this	Can I sharpen my pencil	0.0
What do you think my smallest fraction is Kevin	The smallest fraction is onethird	3.0
Lydia what do you think	Onesixth	3.0
Penelope	One10th	3.0
One10th why is that my smallest fraction	Because the bigger the pieces the smaller the number	4.0
Chloe what was next	Onesixth	3.0
And whats my largest one	Onethird	3.0
All right Mila what order did you put these fractions in	One10ths three10ths seven10ths	3.0
Julia	I think its wrong because theyre all the same denominator I think that seven10ths is the biggest because one10th is still a really small piece still is three seven is the biggest one	4.0
What do you think	Six13	3.0
Six13ths because my bigger denominator means	Smaller pieces	3.0
Nathan what do you think	It would be six10ths	3.0
I get six pieces no matter which way we look at it here youre getting six out of 13 thats pretty small pieces right	Yeah	0.0
Youve heard this before	Weve done this before	0.0
Ferogio what can you tell me	So if you make a square for like a question problem  and it says the area model so outskirts of the perimeter are like  if it was like five inches and then the top is like two inches or three or four	4.0
Which part is the area which part is the perimeter	Well the  parameter is like the outside and the area is in the inside	3.0
Well the  parameter is like the outside and the area is in the inside	Just like how were doing that solve the mystery case of the shrink ray gun	1.0
We want to know the inside area	That might be a lot of money	0.0
And you know what he told me	What	0.0
Youre putting in a tree	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	You should change your floors into	0.0
You should change your floors into	My great grandma died yesterday sadly	0.0
Samantha you think you have an idea	Yeah	0.0
What do you think	You multiply the base and the height	3.0
Ethan how do we find the perimeter	You have to add the length of all the sides	3.0
This was a reminder for us right	Yeah	0.0
Okay give me 15 jumping jacks because I think youre still sleeping you might have eaten too many  this weekend	I didnt eat	0.0
I didnt eat	I did	0.0
I did	I ate too many	0.0
I ate too many	How many	0.0
William did you already do your jumping jacks	Yes	0.0
You did what	Three times seven	3.0
Samantha	Seven	3.0
What did you say	He said you need to  I think	0.0
He said you need to  I think	No he probably said oh you need help on your hand or something like that	0.0
No he probably said oh you need help on your hand or something like that	Thats exactly what I just said	0.0
Okay	I forgot about it	0.0
Three plus three	That would equal 20 because three  plus three equals six and seven plus seven equals 14	4.0
I did seven plus three is 10 seven plus three is 10	Oh 20	3.0
So our perimeter equals what		3.0
20	20 square inches	3.0
All right lets turn it over make sure youre totally awake and then were going to get to some challenging things	Now I remember now thank you Ms Smith	0.0
How does that ABxH and PBBHH how does that help us out	Okay	0.0
All right  Ready	Almost just need one more minute	0.0
Olivia okay are you done with the area	Yes	0.0
What did you do	I did 10 times four because I know that those are both the  four inches and its like kind of the main character of	4.0
Okay our base and our height right	Yes	0.0
And what did you get for your final answer	I got 40 because 10 times  10 times four equals 40	4.0
40	Inches	3.0
Inches squared	Yes	0.0
Did anybody else match	Centimeters	3.0
Centimeters squared	I was about to say	0.0
Now oh three and three	Oh four and four	3.0
How did you finish this out	So I added  28	3.0
So you got 20 here and your got this here and then you got a total of 28	Meters	3.0
Meters	Centimeters	1.0
Show me on thumbs how do we feel about our area and perimeter refresher	I guess	0.0
All right all right  all right	What	0.0
What	Oh shes giving us one of those problems where you have to guess the area	0.0
Oh shes giving us one of those problems where you have to guess the area	Oh yes	0.0
So heres what you know	I know the answer	0.0
Do we know the height	Yes five	3.0
So thats definitely not my best place to start	Youre missing half the	3.0
I know	Five times  six equals 30	4.0
Five times  six equals 30	Sorry	0.0
What	Multiplication first	3.0
How did you solve this	What I did I started counting by five to get to 30 and I found six	4.0
Okay	And so I did five times six equals 30 and then for	4.0
And so I did five times six equals 30 and then for	I did five plus five plus five	4.0
Yeah Olivia helped you out with that part	Ive been knowing that	0.0
What did you do for our perimeter William	I did  seven because I got the  and put it  on top of the mystery	4.0
Right	Five times seven equals 35	4.0
Kayla help us out	Six plus six five plus five	3.0
I have a  six six five and a five		3.0
What is it		3.0
Did I figure it all out	I have a different way to find that base	0.0
Okay what did you do	So you can use the area divide the area by the height	3.0
He said well thats the same as 30 divided by five equals	Six	3.0
Okay lets try one more	One more	0.0
Did I give you an area	No	0.0
Did you check in with Emily	Think about it	0.0
Think about it	The bottom is 50	3.0
The bottom is 50	And the question mark on the side what is it	2.0
And the question mark on the side what is it	What makes 35	2.0
What makes 35	By multiplication	2.0
You should have written it down so it should be on your paper	You did a problem last question we did a problem about five times what equals	3.0
in their time of need	So what do you think five times seven is	2.0
Avery what do you think	figure out how to  equals 350	3.0
Why do you think that this is our starting point	Oh because to be able to figure out the perimeter and to figure out the height of the box	4.0
Hes absolutely correct	Perimeter is 50 inches  inches is the area  so if you do some very very simple problem like multiplication  if you can divide	4.0
You took the area formula and you replaced what you knew	I originally just  in my head and I figured out the  height	3.0
I originally just  in my head and I figured out the  height		3.0
Okay you said 70	70 times 50	3.0
Yeah	Seven times five is 35	4.0
Uhhuh	So you make a	0.0
How many zeros do you have over here	One	3.0
How many zeros do you have over here	That would be 3500	3.0
Let me talk to Avery	No it should be seven	3.0
And then if we make some mistakes we can easily go back and see what we did	I know what to do	0.0
You know what to do	Yes	0.0
Walk us through perimeter	So for perimeter I did 50 plus 50 and then after that 70 plus 70	4.0
Jump off	Seven	3.0
Ferogio made the same mistake you did	Yeah same	0.0
I was waiting for inches	Squared	3.0
I have to burn almost 10000 calories in 32 days	Or you could burn 1000 calories per day	3.0
What do you think	Yeah	0.0
So think about that one	Can you mute David	0.0
Im sorry what	Can you mute David	0.0
What did you do	I subtracted 16000 with 11716	3.0
Why	Because  maybe if I subtracted maybe I thought I would get the answer	4.0
whatd you try	Division	3.0
Tell me what youre dividing	Im dividing by thirteen	3.0
What are you dividing		3.0
Why are you doing that	Because if youre trying to burn if youre on that right now and this	4.0
Because if youre trying to burn if youre on that right now and this	The thing for outside the box  burn calories in a day	4.0
Whatd you try	Division Im trying to divide 16000 by 13	3.0
Why 16000 by 13	But Im starting to regret that	3.0
Why	Because I just figured out that I have to do something completely different	3.0
Tell me more	I have to subtract 11716 from 16000	3.0
Why	Because if I get the number then I still need to do and then divide that 13 then I	4.0
Carrie	First I subtracted the thing but then I divided the number I got so its 13	3.0
Okay why	Because  to see how much  and then I divided	4.0
If want 16000 calories and Ive already burned What do I need to do here	Subtract	3.0
Chloe did you finish it	Mmhmm	0.0
Walk us through Chloe	Okay	0.0
Okay	So what I got by  and the answer I got 5717	3.0
Okay	Okay when I got my answer I kind of thought	0.0
Walk me through the subtraction	So six minus three over six  one	4.0
So six minus three over six  one	You have to trade	4.0
If I have zero can I take six	No	0.0
Diego	So  for six and Ive got a five	4.0
So  for six and Ive got a five	a ten and a nine but I dont have	4.0
I think I lost you  right here you did 10 minus six and got four nine minus one and got	Eight	3.0
Eight nine minus seven	Two	3.0
Five minus one	Four	3.0
If I dont eat for two days	I was close	0.0
I was close	Now I see where I messed up	0.0
Now I see where I messed up	I just forgot my trade	3.0
Carrie	Im pretty sure you divide 4000 by 13	3.0
Why would you divide	Because you can divide it by  so that way  each day how much	4.0
Thirteens  are not something that weve memorized very well	No	0.0
So 13 times one 13 times two is 26 13 times three  equals 39	multiplication problems because I can just add zero to everything	4.0
So if I put a 39 how many zeros do I need	Two	3.0
Two	Dos	1.0
That gets me pretty close huh	Yeah	0.0
Chloe can I do two minus nine	No	0.0
Whats 12 minus nine	Three	3.0
What do you think comes next	Add that thing	3.0
what do you think	13 times 20	3.0
What does 13 times 20 get me		3.0
Yeah	Oh my god its going to be too big	3.0
39 Because I might charge so I know that  this will be 12	Are we just going  to keep subtracting by 39	3.0
Maybe because thats what I know right now	I did some	0.0
I did some	I did 13 times 20	3.0
Okay so 85 and another three is 39		0.0
	49	0.0
Thats with a remainder of seven	Yeah	0.0
Okay so I have 300 plus 20 plus three plus three plus three		3.0
Three plus three plus three is	Nine	3.0
And zero plus two is	Two	3.0
Two		1.0
James	To be really precise to get to that exact goal	3.0
To be really precise to get to that exact goal	In exactly 13 days you burn  329 and seven thirteenths	3.0
And seven thirteenths right	Or you can just burn 330	3.0
If I round it up since 330 Im going to make sure I hit the goal and Ill probably have a few extra calories on top	Yeah	0.0
I can totally do that right	Yeah you could totally do it	3.0
Yeah you could totally do it	If thats so easy how about 660	2.0
How many 50 I need how many calories		3.0
So I can subtract that right	Yes	0.0
Subtract that really quick	Im going to trade this time	3.0
Im going to trade this time	Trade	3.0
Trade yes	Do I have to  trade	0.0
Do I have to  trade	I want to try and walk us through it one more time	0.0
Is it doable	Im not thinking in one day	3.0
Well not in one day but 13 days	Maybe	0.0
walk me through this	So we cant do any of those so  make it as a zero and then add 10  10 minus six	4.0
So we cant do any of those so  make it as a zero and then add 10  10 minus six	No you move the two into a one then that one	4.0
Were going to cheat for this last part in honor of time and just go to the calculator	Aww I was so close	0.0
If I have 9284 calories and I divide that over 13 days thats 714 hours a day	You want to do it	0.0
Thats not too bad	Thats not that bad	0.0
Thats not that bad	You can make it	0.0
You can make it	Okay then you do it	0.0
So then I have to do three and a half yogas a day	But dont you like yoga	0.0
I do	I have three extra hours Ill do it	0.0
Why are you not reading for 30 minutes if you have three extra hours	Okay thats	0.0
But I think right now were just going for the 40	about the	0.0
about the	You said it last time	0.0
I dont remember  that	When you first got into the gym	0.0
When you first got into the gym	The ab workout	0.0
Oh yeah the ab workout	Ms  I have a great idea for you	0.0
Yeah	So whats the hardest one and the one you can burn the most calories	0.0
Usually Id say yoga	Okay then how many hours do you have by yourself	0.0
Zero	Okay	0.0
Okay	I know that	0.0
I know that	Unless he drops it off to her parents house	0.0
Unless he drops it off to her parents house	Okay but if thats possible then you should  at least be able to do two and a half hours and get 400 calories	0.0
Sure	Maybe	0.0
Yeah and Ill just ignore my family and my children	Okay lets go	0.0
Okay lets go	I will help you burn the calories lets go into her account and then every single day  goal	0.0
So lets go back to this	Oh that was hard	0.0
Whats a fruit basket	A basket of fruit	0.0
So if you picture after and hes standing there and all of these people brought him the oranges what is he going to do	Put them in a basket	3.0
How many is he going to put in each basket	Five	3.0
You following	Uhhuh	0.0
Chloe	So its not exactly what I did but I counted up all the oranges so each one where he brought every single one and	3.0
Do we know how many oranges he has	Yeah	0.0
We have to do something here	We have to add	3.0
We have to add	Addition	1.0
Once we know how many oranges he had what are we going to do with	Divide it by five	3.0
Why Julia	Because the number of baskets is multiplication	4.0
Because the number of baskets is multiplication	Its either multiplication of division because its multiple baskets  all of that	4.0
Because that would say each orange  multiplied and turned into five oranges	So division	3.0
So now knowing what weve just talked about here I  want you to go back and make adjustments to the work youve already done	Okay	0.0
Okay	Mmhmm	0.0
Does that make sense	Mmhmm	0.0
How many years has he been there	More than 10	3.0
What do we need	How many days are in a year	3.0
How many days in a year		3.0
		1.0
So now what do we do	Maybe we times it by something because its 9855 days	4.0
What do you want to multiply it with	The 365	3.0
Why did you do that	Because	0.0
So Penelope says she tried this	If you use multiplication	3.0
Do you think multiplication would solve this problem	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	Division	1.0
Im hearing some yes  Im hearing some no	I did something similar	1.0
Do you think this will solve our problem	No but I figured out how	0.0
Is that what we want to figure it out	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
So lets think about it some more	Division	3.0
You did what	I did 9356	3.0
Carrie what do you think	I think we should divide	3.0
Why would we divide	Divide a year	3.0
Julia what do you think	I agree with her because it would make more sense  in the process because this one wouldnt make that much sense because like you said it says days in 9855 years and this one would make more sense because its actually going to tell you the years because as we remember yesterday when we were dividing that one that one made more sense because it actually had a smaller number than what it has  now	4.0
I agree with her because it would make more sense  in the process because this one wouldnt make that much sense because like you said it says days in 9855 years and this one would make more sense because its actually going to tell you the years because as we remember yesterday when we were dividing that one that one made more sense because it actually had a smaller number than what it has  now	So it wouldnt make sense with multiplication	4.0
How old do you think Ivan is	From the voice from the movie he sounds pretty young	3.0
Over a hundred years	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	Okay	0.0
So if your answer was over  100 does it make sense	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
Does that work	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
We know that gorillas probably dont live to be hundreds of years old or even thousands	They probably live to be around the humans age	0.0
But lets think about what dividing would be	but I did know what to divide by	0.0
So in order to make a year how many days will  Ivan have had to have been in the enclosure	Probably like	0.0
This is definitely way above where were at	We dont even know how to get 365	2.0
So we know lets think about this we know 365 times one is		3.0
		1.0
Does that help me out	Yes	0.0
10 years	Thats a lot and thats not even our answer yet	3.0
Could I do that again	Yeah	0.0
Another 10 years	I got 25	3.0
I got 25	I got 87	1.0
I got 87	15 years	1.0
15 years	Zero years	1.0
Okay now can I do another 3650	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	I know exactly what to do	0.0
What	We have to do some wrestling with 365 times seven	3.0
That sounds like extra work for me	I did 365 times eight	3.0
So what is 365 times seven James	Well to make it easier for myself I did 365 times six and then 365 time one	4.0
Whats 365 times three	1  095	3.0
1  095	Me too	1.0
Me too	I got that one too	1.0
I got that one too	26 years	1.0
26 years	I got 25	1.0
The thing here	Kind of	0.0
Kind of	I did	0.0
Did you get 1410	Nope	0.0
What did  you get there	Isnt it  26 years	3.0
Okay	I didnt know that we were supposed to divide by 365 so I divided by one	3.0
Does my answer make sense	Yes	0.0
If we answered Ivans been in the enclosure for 27 years does that make sense	Yes	0.0
Yes	If its somewhere around there it also kind of makes sense	1.0
Probably be dead by then	So I  know  but I tried addition because I knew  and I know thats wrong but I was going to try	3.0
So I think about so Ivan was in his cell or his domain and lets say he had a marker and he was keeping tally of every day hes been in there right	His whole domain would have been filled up	3.0
His whole domain would have been filled up	Right	0.0
what did you get	The bottle	0.0
Your final  answer		3.0
Nathan what was your answer	I divided and	3.0
27		3.0
What was your answer		3.0
David		3.0
25		3.0
Julia do you have a written answer	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I got 30 with the remainder of two	3.0
How does she know when shes got enough	Division	3.0
Why do you think division	Because its groups of the water bottles	4.0
Now she could be in her mind doing this Okay I have four and then I added another four and another four and another four	Thats going to take forever	3.0
What is she doing right here	Adding	3.0
Repeated addition right	Multiplication	3.0
Whats our easier way	Division	3.0
Piper	We can do  four times 30	3.0
What is four times 30		3.0
		1.0
What was your mistake	My mistake was	0.0
He wrote 20 here	I had to rewrite it because I just	0.0
Definitely	I thought it would be easier if I did 120 but it didnt really work	3.0
Matteo	Okay	0.0
Okay	I did not know what you mean but from the answer do you mean the one where you do something times four equals 112	3.0
So when you gave me that 112	I thought thats my answer	3.0
I thought thats my answer	The number I got was 28	3.0
I really like multiplication Im just going to multiply it	You cant be like Ooh I really like that	0.0
Should we have to guess what youre doing today	No	0.0
David	Can we work with partners	0.0
Dont skip that equation part	Why did we do that	2.0
Ella what did  we draw	I drew three circles to do for the vases	3.0
Okay	Its doing the thing again Miss	0.0
It was doing that yesterday  Why	Internet	0.0
He doesnt need to	Miss me and my mom tried making  crumble cookies and they were good but not the same	0.0
Miss me and my mom tried making  crumble cookies and they were good but not the same	I got crumble cookies but I wasnt at my house I was at a friends birthday party	0.0
Three circles	Three circles for the vases and I put four dots for the flowers	3.0
So each circle had four dots to represent	The flowers	3.0
Did anybody have something similar or different	I got  something different	1.0
Carrie did you do something different than Ella	I actually drew flowers and a vase	3.0
What kind of an equation did you come up with David	4x312	4.0
Miguel what do you think	The second one is wrong	1.0
Why is it wrong	8x4 is actually 32	4.0
Julia what do you think	He didnt really have to do that because  its telling you its groups of flowers	4.0
He didnt really have to do that because  its telling you its groups of flowers	Its three multiple of four	4.0
Carrie	I think  bottom ones a little bit off because they didnt really have those numbers on he paper so  I dont think you should use multiple	4.0
What made it so easy	Just drawing it	3.0
Ella	What helped me is the drawing and how I know what 4x3 is	3.0
James	I think it was so easy because its a bit basic its like third grade math	3.0
You too	I didnt know that you could add soda to flowers	0.0
Is there another equation we can use	4x3	3.0
Uhuh	2x6	3.0
Uhuh  Carrie	Im thinking you could divide something	3.0
Im thinking you could divide something	There is an  option in it	3.0
Is that the same	Yeah	0.0
So he did yeah	Mmhmm	0.0
Does this represent the soda that were adding	Yes	0.0
Do you agree with Diegos drawing here	Yeah	0.0
Julia	I did one fourth cup one fourth one fourth	4.0
I did one fourth cup one fourth one fourth	And it equals three fourths	4.0
Anybody have another equation Carrie	I did 14 x 3	3.0
And what did you get for  an answer	34	3.0
Is our process similar to what we were doing when we were thinking about the flowers in the vase	Yes	0.0
Carrie	Fraction	3.0
Chloe	I thought it was different when you asked the question something looked off like it wasnt right	3.0
I thought it was different when you asked the question something looked off like it wasnt right	But then when you wrote it down you had a similar to what the question was asking so I couldnt really understand what it was	3.0
So we took that piece of multiplying whole numbers the flowers and the vase remembered what we knew about multiplication and thats going to help you with solving these problems	I have a question	2.0
Yeah	What if the common denominator	0.0
Whats a bunch	Probably a dozen or more	3.0
Florist has five bunches does it matter how many flowers are in each bunch	No	0.0
How many cups of water does the florist need		3.0
Diego how much water do we need	Five  cups of water	3.0
Julia what do you think	Well because this was a fraction I did 38 x 5	4.0
What did you get		3.0
	But the problem is that that doesnt what do you call  it	2.0
What do you call it	Where the bottom	2.0
Did you do it then what did you get	I got five cups	3.0
Matteo	I raised my hand for the 158 cups of water	3.0
Okay	What I think	0.0
No did you get a different answer	No	1.0
How much water is going into each vase	One cup	3.0
One cup here one cup here Whats my equation	I dont know	2.0
Chloe whats my equation	So my picture didnt look exactly like that but I thought that by the picture each one  has five and each have one cup	4.0
So my picture didnt look exactly like that but I thought that by the picture each one  has five and each have one cup	So I thought maybe divide by five	4.0
Matteo	5 x 38	3.0
How much water is she putting in each one	One cup	3.0
What did you and Ella talk about	What we talked about is	0.0
How many cups of water does she need	One	3.0
Nobodys showing me then we dont need any time	Wait	0.0
Where in our information does it talk about food coloring	At the end	3.0
What does it say Ben	It says and three teaspoons of food coloring	3.0
Thats the piece we need	We talked too much about water and now	3.0
How much does she put in vase one	38	3.0
How much does she put in vase two	38	3.0
In vase three	38	3.0
Four	38	3.0
Five	38	3.0
Youre understanding what she did right	Yes	0.0
James	Well we can probably use five function so 5 x 38	3.0
She did 38 five times	I got it right	0.0
Is there another equation she could use William	I got it right on the first equation	0.0
Because we know that multiplication is what	Repeated addition	3.0
So this is a whole	All the math at like	0.0
All the math at like	So what I did is both problems and then	0.0
So what I did is both problems and then	Because I knew it wouldnt just be two numbers by itself and	3.0
So now Has anybody ever made	I have	0.0
How many batch is she  making	Two	3.0
You following me	Yes	0.0
Caleb	I think it would be 23  5	3.0
I took three teaspoons and another three teaspoons	Oh  33	3.0
Look at all the hands Lilliana	Two	3.0
So how many teaspoons did she used	Six	3.0
Six	That was easy	0.0
Look at 224	I  told you	0.0
So youre going to finish out what do you have four problems left because we did one together	Yeah four	0.0
What does it mean to decompose fractions	Ms  what page is it	0.0
Carrie	To make it into the little pieces	3.0
So  give me an example for fourfifths	Onefifth four times	3.0
whatd you do	What I did was I did onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth plus onesixth five times and I got fivesixths	4.0
Yeah	I did threesixths plus twosixths	3.0
Does that also work	Yeah	0.0
James did you do it another way	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Fivesixths equals onesixth times five	4.0
Okay but were decomposing remember	Oh	0.0
Do we need another minute to look at that sixeighths or do we have that finished too	Finished	0.0
Finished	I got that done	0.0
Chloe will you decompose this for me	Yep	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I did oneeight plus oneeighth plus oneeighth plus oneeighth  all the way to eight ones	4.0
How many of these did you have	Eight	3.0
Eight	I mean six	3.0
Carrie whatd you do	I did two eighths plus two eighths plus two eighths	4.0
Diego  whatd you do	I did threeeighths plus threeeighths	3.0
Alan whatd you do	I did threeeighths plus threeeighths	3.0
Remember now	Yeah	0.0
Give me a thumbs up if you remember how to decompose a fraction	I havent been to school for  weeks so	0.0
I havent been to school for  weeks so	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	It kind of sounds a little weird because when we did just adding fractions or taking away fractions	0.0
It kind of sounds a little weird because when we did just adding fractions or taking away fractions	We have to decompose this one	0.0
We have to decompose this one	making a new fraction	0.0
making a new fraction	Is this a decomposing one	0.0
Are we talking about water or glue	Water	3.0
Is there enough water for everyone	No	0.0
What do you think we need to figure out first	How many cups of water is in one quart	3.0
Carrie what do you think	I think you need to figure out how many water youre going to need	3.0
How much water are we going to need	More	3.0
More	Onefourth times nine	3.0
Did you figure it out already	No	0.0
No	Not yet but Im still on it	0.0
Ready	Yes	0.0
Avery what do you think	So theres nine members and theyre each getting onefourth cup of water	4.0
So theres nine members and theyre each getting onefourth cup of water	Thats going to be ninefourths cups of water	4.0
How did you get ninefourths cups of water	Because I just one times nine is nine	4.0
Right	Mmhmm	0.0
Diego what do we get	Ninefourths but its not ninefourths because	3.0
Look at this math thinking	Oh I thought you were mad for a second	0.0
Oh I thought you were mad for a second	I was like Oh no	0.0
I was like Oh no	Whatd we do	0.0
Yeah	Theres going to be five wholes	3.0
Take a step back	Two	3.0
Fourfourths is a whole right	Mmhmm	0.0
Plus can I get another fourfourths	Yes	0.0
What does that give me	Eightfourths	3.0
Eightfourths plus  Oh	Ninefourths	3.0
So  what is it	Two wholes and onefourth	3.0
Two wholes and onefourth	Two and onefourth	1.0
We have a whole here and a whole here plus	Two and onefourth	3.0
Okay	So two and onefourth	0.0
So two and onefourth	Ive never seen Ms Douglas so happy	0.0
One quart	Equals	3.0
equals	Four cups	3.0
Four cups	Because theres two cups in one pint and two pints in one quart	4.0
So  is there enough water for everyone	Yes	0.0
Yes and we can explain it right	Mmhmm	0.0
They have enough water because in order for everyone to get water they would need a total of two and onefourths cup and one quart equals	Four cups	3.0
Yes	Yes	0.0
Yay	I didnt know that because I didnt see the homework	0.0
I didnt know that because I didnt see the homework	Ive never seen Ms Douglas  so happy before but thats a good thing right	0.0
Are we ready to keep going	Yes	0.0
Questions about anything we did here	No	0.0
No	That test from yesterday sucked out all my brain juice	0.0
Thats the one we just did	No	0.0
No	It was a different question	0.0
Baking	No	0.0
No	It was the answer	0.0
Baking	Muffins	3.0
Let me check	Why eggs	0.0
Were on page 232 in your math journal		0.0
What are we making	Muffins	3.0
and  her sister are making 12 blueberry wheat muffins for breakfast	Which page is it	0.0
Are we ready	Mmhmm	0.0
Sounds delicious doesnt it	Thats a lot of ingredients	0.0
The sisters want to do what	Triple the recipe	3.0
If  youre tripling something how many are you making	Three	3.0
What is it	Three	3.0
Three	Three	1.0
They want three batches		3.0
How much is one recipe for baking powder	Two	3.0
Two	Two teaspoons	1.0
Two teaspoons	Six teaspoons	3.0
So if they need two teaspoons but were making three recipes what are we going to do	Six	3.0
Six	Six teaspoons	1.0
I said What are we going to do	Triple the amount	3.0
Triple the amount	Were going to triple the portion	1.0
Which means were going to	Multiply	3.0
By	Three	3.0
Which would mean we now need	Six	3.0
Six	Six teaspoons	1.0
Look at you guys	Six teaspoons	3.0
Six teaspoons	Is that six or six	2.0
What do you think it is	Six	3.0
Okay	This is hard just because the words scramble up  your brain to thinking it is hard	0.0
How many teaspoons of salt do they need now	One	3.0
I cant see it from here	How many teaspoons of salt	0.0
If you have an answer  I want you to stand up and do 20 jumping jacks	I am not standing up	0.0
I am not standing up	Thats harder	0.0
David in one recipe how much salt do they need  for one recipe	Onefourth	3.0
Onefourth what	Teaspoon	3.0
So what are we going to do to this onefourth teaspoon	Times three	3.0
David how many teaspoons do they need for all three recipes	Onetwelfth	4.0
Onetwelfth	If they have four three times its 12	4.0
So whats the answer	Threefourths	3.0
So then how much do we need	Threefourths	3.0
Threefourths of a teaspoon	Thats what I got	1.0
Feeling good	Mmhmm	0.0
Im going to have to erase  to scroll up	Thats all right	0.0
Do you need this for a minute	No	0.0
No	Wait	0.0

Same	Why	0.0
Why	Some people do it really fast and sometimes we have to rush	0.0
Thats okay	Thats an improper	3.0
Ready	Yes	0.0
Once you think you have an answer for that youre going to do 30 jumping jacks	Oh okay	0.0
Owen	One half	3.0
So what are we going to do to that	Either add it three  times or multiply it	3.0
Okay and then whats my answer Diego	You get a whole and one half	3.0
We got this right	Yes	0.0
But what is that	Improper	3.0
Improper but	Its improper	3.0

Its a lot easier to think math when you have someone to think with	Ms Douglas when you said Shut it down for a second I thought something was going to happen	0.0
Know your plan	Yeah	0.0
Lets get to work	Ms Douglas	0.0
What year was I born	Youll be 60 years old	3.0
1960 1971 1980 2012 81 remainder one nine remainder 16 11600 18005 14965	Is that even a year	0.0
What are you thinking	I think its 1940 though because my grandpa 60 so I just took 20 away and its 1940	4.0
What do we think when we see those answers	For the 81 with a remainder of one and the nine with a remainder of 16 I dont really think that makes sense	3.0
Why doesnt it make sense to have a remainder	Thats not really a year	3.0
And this would say that I was born in the year nine	9 what	2.0
9 what	Dinosaurs	0.0
Dinosaurs	We were not alive at that point	0.0
What else do you notice	I figured out that	0.0
No I wantWhat do you notice about the numbers up there	Well the last three are way far in the future so you cant be born in the future if youre here right now	3.0
What year is it		3.0
		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
Oh my gosh	Well be dead at that point	0.0
This is way way way in the future	Probably flying cars	0.0
Probably flying cars	Unless you time traveled	0.0
I mean I guess we could have traveled back in time but these seem kind of unrealistic right	so big that the earth would be	0.0
And we usually dont write years with remainders	Thats just weird	0.0
Is that fact	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
One day every year I get to celebrate my birthday	Same	0.0
Does this number have anything to do with my problem	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
If you used this number in figuring out your solution it has nothing to do with	You have to use the 41 because its basically saying how many days until your birthday	4.0
No	Its just saying how much days are in a year	3.0
Im 41 years old	Are you actually	0.0
I obviously this right	Also the year were in right now	3.0
What	The year were in right now	3.0
What does that have to do with anything	Because thats the year that were actually in	4.0
So what year are we in		3.0
		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
So that wasnt in the problem but you guys tell me I need that	Then you can just minus 21 and then 2000 year 20 and then if you minus 20 you get 19	4.0
Julia	Because its the year were in now and if you subtract it you can get to places you want for the year	4.0
So if I take the year now and subtract the number of years Ive been alive that will tell me when I was born	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah thats what I did	1.0
Yeah thats what I did	And besides that sort of states taking away	1.0
So the year I was born plus 41 is going to give me		3.0
		1.0
The opposite of addition is	Subtraction	3.0
Subtraction	Subtraction	1.0
Subtraction	Subtraction	1.0
Subtraction	Subtraction	1.0
Does 2012 makes sense	No	0.0
No	No because then you would be 8	4.0
No because then you would be 8	No youd be nine	1.0
No youd be nine	No youd be nine this year	1.0
was born in 2012	My little cousin was	0.0
Again one of those questions T was born in 2012	Youd be nine	3.0
Okay	Because youre 41	4.0
Because youre 41	1940 is too You would be too old	1.0
If I was born in 1940 how old would I be	60	3.0
60		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
I mean I could look really good for 81 but I told you in the problem that Im	Well youre going to be walking like this	0.0
Whats one minus one	Zero	3.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Two minus four	You cant do that	3.0
You cant do that	You cant do that	1.0
Can I take from here	No	0.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
If I take for my two it has to go to my	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
Zero	Zero	1.0
hundreds place and my zero turns into	A 10	3.0
A 10	A 10	1.0
A 10	A 10	1.0
A 10	A 10	1.0
And now I can take from here to turn this into		3.0
	12	1.0
Whats 12 minus four		3.0
		1.0
	I got the answer	0.0
I got the answer	I knew it	0.0
So yeah I was born in 1980	My mom was born in 1980	0.0
Youre picking out numbers and youre just doing it	You have to think about the subtraction and actually the addition	3.0
Those are all connected	T	0.0
but theyre not relevant to what you were asked to solve	I think the reason why they have a remainder and why it could be weird it was because some people thought it was division	4.0
They put them in there to trick you	Theres	0.0
Theres	I didnt know the answer but I did solve	2.0
Yes	Now I kind of get why I got 11600 because I calculated how many days youve been alive	4.0
Carrie what do you know	Im pretty sure that rays you kind of draw lines and you could also use rays to multiply	3.0
But yeah okay good connection	Its kind of like geometry	3.0
What else do you know	Rays helps when youre doing multiple	3.0
Nathan what do you remember from yesterday	We were doing arrays	3.0
What were we making with our arrays	Lines	3.0
Penelope what were we making with our arrays	Square numbers	3.0
Or can you just tell me whats a square number Owen	It is	0.0
It is	We have square numbers 1 4 9 16 25 36 49	3.0
These are all square numbers right Ben	Mmhmm	0.0
Ella do you remember what is square number	I think its	0.0
Carrie	A number that has a square in an array	3.0
I gave you a word yesterday and I said these two numbers are called Do you remember what that is	Factor	3.0
Now were going to start to take things further okay	Okay	0.0
Are you following me	Yes	0.0
Okay good	Do we still write that on our paper	0.0
Count by fives	Count by fives	3.0
How many groups of five do we need in this case	Five	3.0
Did I have to count back	No	0.0
Did I have to count boxes	No	0.0
David what was one of your strategies	I just counted by fives and then took the five from the seven and seven plus five made twelve	4.0
Okay	So how I did it was I just made a big square and I divided it and made some boxes and counted them	4.0
So how I did it was I just made a big square and I divided it and made some boxes and counted them	And then what I realized was all of them were equal	4.0
And then what I realized was all of them were equal	They were all seven	4.0
They were all seven	So seven plus seven	4.0
Ella what was your strategy	My strategy was that I counted five times seven	3.0
So you were counting by what number	Five	3.0
Are you ready	Five 10 15 20 20 25 30 35	4.0
Whats five times seven		3.0
If you think Im only 20 then	You have to be like thirty something	0.0
You have to be like thirty something	Unless	0.0
Unless	No shes 27	0.0
No shes 27	27	0.0
27	She looks older than that	0.0
Its a two by seven right	Ten	3.0
You ready	Yep	0.0
Yeah	No no no	0.0
Kevin what was your strategy for this one	I made squares	3.0
Owen what was your strategy	I counted by twos	3.0
Why did you count by twos	Because it was a good number so I counted by twos	4.0
So because we have 10 versus two so we could count by twos all the way through 10 right	Beautiful	0.0
Mila what did you do	Count by tens	3.0
Why did you choose to count by 10	Because it was a lot easier	4.0
Is there a right way or wrong way	No	0.0
What answer did you get		3.0
Are you ready	Two four six eight ten 12 14 16 18 20	4.0
If we counted by 10s we have two groups of 10	Ten 20	4.0
Ten 20	Which one is easier	2.0
Which one is easier	But either way you got the same answer	3.0
It might be easier it might be faster but either way you got the same answer right	Yeah	0.0
Okay are you ready	Yes	0.0
No dont do that	What is she doing	0.0
Four by six	Okay thats kind of easy	0.0
Julia what did you do	I did four groups of six and I did six groups of two	4.0
I did four groups of six and I did six groups of two	Two more groups of that is 24	4.0
Any other strategies happen	I used the same one	1.0
David	I made the blocks first because I didnt know what to do	4.0
I made the blocks first because I didnt know what to do	And then I used my imagination to multiply the numbers	4.0
Ella what did you do	I counted by fours	3.0
And I saw you you were writing things down werent you	Yeah	0.0
You said And then you did five six seven eight	And then I did 12 then 16 then 20 then 24	4.0
Six groups of four is		3.0
Carrie whats my area		3.0
Were going to do eight of them	Five ten 15 25 30 35 40	4.0
So my area is 40	We did seven and it was 35 and then one more five and it would be 40	4.0
How are we feeling	Good	0.0
Questions	No	0.0
Is that four digits	No	0.0
Say it	Gets 10 times bigger	3.0
When I move to the left it gets	10 times smaller	3.0
My five is worth		3.0
My five is worth		3.0
What is that five worth		3.0
When we move to the right we went up by		3.0
It was worth 10 times more	Its always the same thing	3.0
When I go to the left it becomes what	10 times lower	3.0
10 times lower	One 10th less	1.0
So now youre going to write a number in which 8 is worth one 10th as much	Does it have to be three digits again	3.0
Yeah I just want the three numbers	Okay	0.0
All right my precious little angels	Miss	0.0
Yes	I think that the  the camera	0.0
Guess what	What	0.0
Just one moment	But its 22	0.0
Why is it not letting me present	I think if you hit the arrow up there in the right  it will	0.0
This link	Yeah	0.0
Yes maam	So when it has a number to the side just to clarify thats how many times you multiply it by	3.0
What am I doing	Attaching	3.0
We dont add because what happens when I add zero plus zero	Zero	3.0
What happens if I have 10 and attach a zero to it		3.0
Think about that that anything times zero is	Zero	3.0
10 to the power of one is just		3.0
10 to the power of two is		3.0
10 to the power of three is		3.0
Because its 10 times 10 equals		3.0
Times 10 equals		3.0
I had Maggie	You keep calling her Maggie	0.0
What is it called	Exponent	3.0
What is it called	Exponent	3.0
Now I want you to write the number sentence underneath it	Okay	0.0
What would that look like	10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10	3.0
Attaching what	Zeros	3.0
Brogan whatd you get for an answer	I got one million	3.0
Is it easier for me to write it out in standard form or in exponential notation	Exponential notation	3.0
Jake	Multiplying four times four three times	3.0
Im not adding a zero Im	Attaching a zero	3.0
120 by 10 times 10 what am I doing	Attaching a zero	3.0
Attaching a zero to what		3.0
120 turning it into		3.0
Which makes my number	Higher	3.0
How much bigger	10 times	3.0
If Im doing 1000 times 1000	Holy thats a lot	0.0
Because anything multiplied by zero by itself is	Zero	3.0
So one times zero is zero one times zero is zero one times zero is zero that would be there and then one times one is	One	3.0
Thats an awful long way to do that problem isnt it	Yeah	0.0
When really one two three four five six I know that it is 10 to the power of six because how many zeros did I have	Six	3.0
Every attached zero ups my number by		3.0
Im making you all say this because the more you say it the more it sticks	Muscle memory	3.0
Cole tell me what you think	What was the question again	0.0
How does it help you	Its the pattern that helps you write it is	3.0
Do you need to phone a friend	Yeah	0.0
I want you to listen very carefully once you phone that friend to their response	Jake	0.0
Jake	I think having the exponents helps the number knowing our pattern helps me because if it were 10 to the power of five as my  I could just know that I need to attach five zeros	4.0
Add a zero or attach a zero sorry	when you attach one zero  attach one more	3.0
How many zeros do I have if I say 100 everybody	Two	3.0
He know becomes my what		3.0
How many zeros have I attached	Three	3.0
What place value is Ava		3.0
How many zeros do I have	Four	3.0
What is he place value		3.0
How many zeros have I attached	Five	3.0
What place value is Olivia		3.0
How many zeros have I attached	Six	3.0
What place value is Rylan		3.0
How many zeros have I attached	Seven	3.0
What place value is Izzie		3.0
How many zeros have I attached	Eight	3.0
What place value are you Cole		3.0
Just a minute	Nine	3.0
So if I know the place value system am I able to determine how many zeros need to be attached on that 10	Yes	0.0
If I wanted to go up to 100000000000 Christian I want to know how to go to 100000000000 how many zeros do I attach	Three	3.0
100000000000	Oh	0.0
How many did I attach with 1000000000	Nine	3.0
How many place values is that	It would be 18	3.0
Help him out Josh		3.0
How come 11 Josh	How come 11 is so theres nine zeros for 1000000000 so youre going to attach two zeros to get to 100000000000	4.0
I want your exponential notation to be a 10th of 10 to the power of six	Wait what does that mean	2.0
Wait what does that mean	What	0.0
Or am I getting smaller	Smaller	3.0
These should be done and ready to move on	Its	0.0
What is one 10th of 1000000000 everybody		3.0
Does 10 to the power of seven work on that	No	0.0
Because that got a 10th bigger didnt or it got 10 times bigger	Yeah	0.0
What would the exponential notation of this be everybody	10 to the power of five	3.0
One minute	And you want us to do times 10 and standard notation	3.0
Thumbs up	Give me a thumbs up	0.0
Give me a thumbs up	Thumbs up	0.0
Thumbs up	Thumbs up	0.0
All four	Wait and you want us to go one 10th less every time	3.0
What number is that everybody		3.0
Now 10 to the power of without thinking or without writing I want you to think of something Joshua do you remember 10 to the power of what equaled 1000000000	Uh 11	3.0
That was 100000000000	Oh	0.0
Oh	Nine	3.0
10 to the power of what is going to equal 10000000	10 to the power of seven	3.0
Tell me why 10 to the power of seven	Because 10 to the power of six is 1000000	4.0
Because 10 to the power of six is 1000000	So if you add one more 10 to it its 10000000	4.0
Are you seeing the patterns	Yes	0.0
Ones are	One	3.0
10s are	Two	3.0
100s are	Three	3.0
1000s are	Four	3.0
10000s are	Five	3.0
100000s are	Six	3.0
1000000s are	Seven	3.0
Or what am I attaching to that three everybody	Zero	3.0
How many	Two	3.0
Two	Three	1.0
Three	Two	3.0
Because whats my exponent telling me to attach	Two	3.0
So if I know that three times 10 to the power of two is really just three times 100 I know my answer is what		3.0
What is it		3.0
1000000000 right	Yeah	0.0
Times		3.0
One comma	Zero zero zero	3.0
Zero zero zero comma	Zero zero zero comma	0.0
Zero zero zero comma	Zero zero zero	0.0
How did I know how many zeros I needed to attach everybody	To the power of nine	3.0
Everyone what is seven times 1000000000		3.0
So what should be the first number here		3.0
And what should be the second number	The power of	3.0
Whats 10 to the power of four everybody		3.0
And what does three times 10000 equal		3.0
What number comes here first		3.0
So whats 10 to the power of three everybody		3.0
What		3.0
And what is 25 times 1000		3.0
Whats my power of here		3.0
	Because theres six zeros	4.0
Yeah	Its 93000000	3.0
So it would just be the 1000000 right	Yeah	0.0
What am I multiplying here everybody	93 times 10 to the power of six	3.0
Do you need the pattern	Yes	0.0
And if you forget do we have a resource over her	Yes	0.0
So	Oh	0.0
Emily	You could	0.0
Give me a variety of different ways I can write 6000 in expanded form	You could write the six and then underneath you could write 1000	3.0
Whats another way I could write it Jake	Just 6000 plus	3.0
6000 plus	Because its 6000 then plus the 100	3.0
Whats another way I could write it Harmony	You could do in parentheses six times 10 to the power of three	3.0
Six times 10 to the power of three plus one times 10 to the power of what	Two	3.0
Plus two times 10 to the power of	One	3.0
Plus five times 10 to the power of	Zero	3.0
Got it	Yeah	0.0
You already did your 21 so you do not have to redo it	Its the same thing all the way down	3.0
So if I estimate that a 100 times a 100 is 10 is that reasonable	No	0.0
Dont solve it just say Ive given you four and Im multiplying it by 10 to the power of I said three right	Yes three	0.0
Som what would be a reasonable answer	1000	3.0
Okay	3000	3.0
Why 3000 versus 1000	Because I know when we do 10 times three you attach three zeros  1000	4.0
Because I know when we do 10 times three you attach three zeros  1000	And then if you multiply by four you get	4.0
So is it okay to look at the problem and know that four times one or anything times one is that answer	Yes	0.0
And then attach those zeros	Mmhmm	0.0
Where have you heard that word before	In reading	3.0
What are we doing in reading	Deconstructing a prompt	3.0
Okay	And Im going to be with that one	0.0
Whats the basic fact of five times four		3.0
Whats five times 40		3.0
Whats 50 times 40		3.0
Whats 50 times 400		3.0
Jake share the response William gave	Jake I didnt understand  anyone else talk to me	0.0
Or sorry Katie tell me what your partner said	He said that he knows that five times four is 20	4.0
He said that he knows that five times four is 20	And then	0.0
Okay go ahead Im sorry	five times four is 20	4.0
five times four is 20	And then he knows that the 40 has a zero on it so he attach the zero to the 20 to get 200	4.0
And then he knows that the 40 has a zero on it so he attach the zero to the 20 to get 200	And then he did the same here	4.0
how about it please	so five times 40 you have to do five times forty first and then the extension is ending here	4.0
so five times 40 you have to do five times forty first and then the extension is ending here	Or attaching	4.0
And why	because times four is 20 and  to do it again but then its	4.0
So go ahead and explain why you disagree with Emily	Because if you do the same question from before and then just can  its still one 10	1.0
Tell me where you made your mistake	At just  one because thats only one	4.0
What		3.0
20000		3.0
Because I have two zeros though why is it not just 200 Landon	Yeah	0.0
Its 2000 but I want to know why its 2000 and not 200 when I only have two zeros	How its 2000 is because if you do five times four it is already 20	4.0
How its 2000 is because if you do five times four it is already 20	And then 50 times four is ads another two zero	4.0
And then Im going to attach two more zeros to it	And so what happens to five times four	2.0
I can attach the zeros	Attach the zeros	0.0
Everybody whats this one		3.0
Make estimates on those	Do you want us to write on	0.0
Im just telling you	like that	0.0
But its three times nine		3.0
Thats not a reasonable one because you know what the fact is	Oh okay	0.0
Charles whats your reasonable estimate on the first one	My estimate is 270000	3.0
What makes your estimate of 27 270000 reasonable	Because three times nine is 27	4.0
Because three times nine is 27	Just add three zeros	4.0
You answer		3.0
So what Im talking about is that your 1s through 12s you know	Thank you	0.0
Mr Mason can do a 3minute times test and he can finish in 54 seconds	Wow	0.0
Thats how good he is	Wow	0.0
I dont understand it	Oh yeah I dont understand it	0.0
And if you notice it drops by one every time 9 18 27 36 45 53 62		3.0
54 63 72 81	90 99	3.0
That is our goal for today	Okay	0.0
So that is one way	Okay	0.0
If you dont know your multiplication facts how easy is that going to be	Very	3.0
Get your whiteboards out	Do we put on our	0.0
Thats going to go in your math binder thats going to go in your math section	Can we take our planners out too	0.0
What	Can we take our planners out	0.0
You can leave your planners in there until were ready for them	Wait  whiteboards out too	0.0
Base 10 whenever I am multiplying something by 10 what am I attaching	Zero	3.0
And if Im multiplying something by 100 what am I attaching	Two zeros	3.0
And 1000	Three zeros	3.0
And 10000	Four	3.0
So we all know that 7 times 6 is		3.0
Whats 7 times 6		3.0
And if I add it to the power of one		3.0
Is this any different than this	No	0.0
So whats my answer down here		3.0
6 times 10 to the power of one is 60	Yeah	0.0
Whats 7 times 4		3.0
whats 7 times 4		3.0
So 7 times 10 to the power of 2 is what Canon		3.0
Pardon me		3.0
Im attaching how many zeros to 7	One	3.0
I have the power of 2 what have we been working on the last two days	Power of 10	3.0
So whats 7 times 10 to the power of 2	I dont know	0.0
What is my answer		3.0
7 times 10 to the power of 2 is what		3.0
Now whats 4 times 7		3.0
So what is 4 times 7 times 10 to the power of 2		3.0
So here we go 4 times 7 everybody		3.0
7 times 10 to the power of 2 everybody		3.0
4 times 7 times 10 to the power of 2		3.0
4 times 700		3.0
What is 9 times 10 to the power of 2 everybody		3.0
100		3.0
Whats 7 times 10 to the power of 2		3.0
So if I know that 9 times 7 is what		3.0
10 to the power of what		3.0
What is my answer		3.0
Im going to ask you to write your name on your whiteboard when youre done	Did I use it right	0.0
Okay Ethan go	So first I did 9 times 30 and got 270	4.0
So first I did 9 times 30 and got 270	And then I did 9 times 4 and got 36 and then I added them together and got 306	4.0
Partial	Sums	3.0
Go ahead	I did 9 times 4 equals 36	4.0
I did 9 times 4 equals 36	And then I did 3 times 9 equals 27	4.0
And then I did 3 times 9 equals 27	And then for the 36 he said that since its 36 you can only put the 6 in the ones so I put the 6 in the ones and then put the three on top and then did 27 plus the 3 and 30	4.0
Go ahead Elijah	So I realized that I did it wrong	3.0
So I realized that I did it wrong	So I did 9 times 4 and I got 36	4.0
So I did 9 times 4 and I got 36	And then I did 9 times 30 and 270	4.0
And then I did 9 times 30 and 270	And then I didnt add 36	4.0
Have I said whos right yet	No	0.0
Go ahead	but what I did is so I did this first and then I got 36	4.0
but what I did is so I did this first and then I got 36	And then I did 3 times 9 which was	4.0
	27	0.0
27	And then I realized I needed to add another zero because it was in the tens place and then I added a  and then 306	4.0
Show me what you did	I saw that I accidentally did 9 times 2 instead of 9 times 3	4.0
I saw that I accidentally did 9 times 2 instead of 9 times 3	I did 9 times 20 to get 180 then 180 plus 36	4.0
I did 9 times 20 to get 180 then 180 plus 36	Then I accidentally did 9 time	4.0
Tell me what you did	I did	0.0
What did you do	9 times 4 to get 36	4.0
9 times 4 to get 36	And I thought it was a two and then I did 9 times 20 to get 180 and did 180 plus 36	4.0
And I thought it was a two and then I did 9 times 20 to get 180 and did 180 plus 36	Right now I know Im sorry I didnt	0.0
Right now I know Im sorry I didnt	I accidentally	0.0
Im not sure how you got 180	Because I accidentally added	4.0
But so 9 times 2 is	9 times 2 is 18	3.0
9 times 20 is	9 times 20 is 180	3.0
And then if I add 3 to it what do I get	I added 30 and I got 210	3.0
210	Because thought that I still had the 30 and then I added 30 on to 180	4.0
The more we own the mistakes we made the more we are going to	Grow	3.0
So everyone what is 34 times 9		3.0
So I want you to think about if the problem was 4 times 9 how would you have done that everybody	4 times 9	3.0
What is the answer		3.0
Youve got 30 seconds	Are we writing it down	0.0
What was the same thing that you would always do if you were multiplying something and what was different	Well the same thing Id always  something is I put it vertically up and down because I cant multiply when its side to side	4.0
Whats another thing that you did that was the same or different	Well I did the same way in the video how they showed us	3.0
Well I did the same way in the video how they showed us	I kind of did it just like he did	3.0
I dont know what he did	So like Amy I can only do it vertically	1.0
So like Amy I can only do it vertically	So what I did first was 9 times 4 then got 36 then I did 9 times 30 which I got 270 then added that and got 306	4.0
Anybody do something different	I didnt do 30 times 9 I did 3 times 9	1.0
Okay	And I added the 3 to the other 3 and then I added the 27 to the 3 that I got	4.0
So she looked at it as just 9 times 3 and then knew that it would be 270 right	Uhhuh	0.0
So	And I just put it in the tens place	3.0
I want you to draw the area model and I want you to write it the way that they have it	I used traditional US	3.0
And then once youve done this you may check it	Okay	0.0
What would your answer be down here	Oh	0.0
Do you remember what partial products are	Yeah I know that	0.0
Yeah I know that	I know how to do it	0.0
Okay	Easy peasy	0.0
Sorry now whats this times this	7 times 6 42	4.0
Everybody watch	You have to switch	0.0
Okay go ahead	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you do 7 times 6 which is 42 then 7 times 5 which is 35 and then add the 0 from up here which is 350 plus 42 which is 392	4.0
Explain to me how	All I did was 6 times seven which is 42 you carry the four and 5 times 7 which is 35 and then add 4 35 plus 4 which is 39 and then you add that in there then 392 is your answer	4.0
Whats the value of the number in the ones column		3.0
Whats the value of the 5		3.0
So you see how I got that number	Yeah	0.0
So 7 times 6 equals		3.0
7 times 50 equals		3.0
If I dont know how to do 7 times 50 can I do 7 times 5	Yes	0.0
And I know Im doing what with my zero	Attaching it	3.0
And what is 350 plus 42		3.0
Did I do 7 times 6 over here	Yes	0.0
And that equals 42 right	Yes	0.0
Then I did 7 times 50 which we all said was 350		0.0
Does this make sense	Yes it makes sense	0.0
So what are your numbers up here	26 times 4	3.0
So what should be the only two numbers up here		3.0
What is the value of that 2	Ones	3.0
Oh it was	Its not working	0.0
Its not working	Its not getting back	0.0
Explain what you did on the one that I asked you to explain	This part	0.0
Yes	So	0.0
The area model	I started by putting the 20 and the 6 right there	3.0
Explain that to me	Because the bigger is always on the top and because I know	4.0
But how do I know thats not 206	Because I know that 20 plus 6 is 26	4.0
Okay	And then I know that 4 times 2 is 8 and so I just added a 0 on attached a 0 on from the 0 in the 20	4.0
And then I know that 4 times 2 is 8 and so I just added a 0 on attached a 0 on from the 0 in the 20	And then I did 6 times 4 which I know is 24 and then I did 80 plus 24 to get 104	4.0
Why dont you draw a line there	To make sure I know that this is not 8024	3.0
Elijah	The reason is so that you kind of know that the 24 is for	1.0
Nate	Because the	0.0
Starts with a V	because the value is 20	3.0
The value of what is 20	The value of the two is 20	3.0
And whats the value of the 6	Its 6	3.0
The 2 what place value does it sit in up there	The tens	3.0
What place value does this sit in here	Ones	3.0
So you had a great learning moment there I hope	Yeah	0.0
Tom come talk to me	So what I did was	0.0
Thank you	6 times 4 equals 24 and then 20 times 4 where I actually did 4 times 2 because equals 8 and then I just attached to 0 which equaled 80	4.0
6 times 4 equals 24 and then 20 times 4 where I actually did 4 times 2 because equals 8 and then I just attached to 0 which equaled 80	Then I did 24 plus 80 and then I put the one right there and then I just added them together and got 104	4.0
I love that Tom said I knew that I needed to multiply 20 times 4 but really 20 times 4 is only really just 4 times 2	Yeah	0.0
But knowing that the value of that 2 makes it a 20 makes me know that it has to be 80 okay	And another way about it is you go down the line and say	0.0
Nate	Instead of having it divided into two parts the center you divide into three parts because the 2 is now worth 200 and the 6 is now worth 60	4.0
4 times 0 is		3.0
4 times 60 is		3.0
Would it be only 24	No	0.0
And now what is 4 times 200		3.0
So it would be 800 plus 240 plus 0	1000	3.0
It is much easier to multiply this way isnt it	Yes	0.0
Whats 4 times 0 everybody		3.0
Whats 4 times 60		3.0
And whats 4 times 200		3.0
Notice Ive kept them in values of the number	Is that partial sums or	3.0
Sums is division	Yeah	0.0
So what is 0 plus 0		3.0
What is 4 plus 0		3.0
And what is 2	Wait what was that	2.0
wait	Thats an 8	3.0
What is 2 plus 8		3.0
Does this make sense	Yes	0.0
And I am not kidding you	Two	0.0
Youre going to use	US traditional	0.0
How have we done that	Yes	0.0
I feel 100 confidence that everybody got it okay	Yes	0.0
Now  Landon what did you just say	I said  area	3.0
You are going to check with me before you move on to 4 5 6 7	Wait so you actually  the one that the guy showed us	3.0
That is US traditional	Where you have to write the numbers	3.0
No yeah 180	So were just doing one and two	0.0
And then I would do 10 times 5 is 50	I told you	0.0
This is 10	Is it that 2 is supposed to be 2000 instead of 200	3.0
No right carry my 2	Yeah	0.0
Is 900 right	Yes	0.0
Okay I can use traditional US multiplication to multiply two digit numbers by two digit numbers and use estimation what is estimation everybody	A guess	3.0
What do you think Amy	Maybe to like look at and think about	3.0
Is that even a reasonable estimation	No	0.0
Is it okay if I estimate space for 20 kids	Yeah	0.0
Now I have to do the exact same with this one	You have to add a zero to the place value	3.0
Ethan	The ones place	3.0
So everybody whats seven times six	Fortytwo	3.0
Everyone what is seven times thirty	Twentyone	3.0
Twentyone	No two hundred and ten	1.0
Twenty one and twenty one plus four	Twenty five	3.0
Yall agree with that	Yes	0.0
Everyone what is twenty times six	One hundred and twenty	3.0
I automatically know that I can write the twenty right	But I need to carry my one	3.0
What is two times three	Six	3.0
Because if Im adding one to it what do most people do	Six hundred and one	3.0
Is that right	No	1.0
I say what is two times six	Twelve	3.0
Or two times three	Six	3.0
And plus one	Seven	3.0
Isnt it automatically already in the hundreds place	Yeah	0.0
Or Im sorry two plus zero	Two	3.0
Five plus two	Seven	3.0
Seven plus two	Nine	3.0
Nine	And my answer is nine hundred seventy two	3.0
Process	Process	3.0
What is my three really worth	Thirty	3.0
What is my six worth	Six	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
So like I say this is where it gets tricky but you guys are rock stars and I have no doubt in my mind that you are going to be successful doing this and you will accurately solve a multiplication problem with a two digit by two digit factor	Okay	0.0
Elijah what do you think	Once we use the answer I think you just have to add a zero at the end because all the only difference is adding ten to eight and you just have to attach the zero	4.0
Layla what do you think	I think you would have to do the ten times the fifty and then the ten times the four and add that one	4.0
What do you think Annie	I think like what Elijah said attach the zero because its times one plus	4.0
I think like what Elijah said attach the zero because its times one plus	I tried to keep it as	4.0
Okay	Lets see if these processes work or if Laylas process works	4.0
Lets see if these processes work or if Laylas process works	Okay	3.0
Everyone whats eight times four	Thirty two	3.0
Everyone whats eight times five	Forty	3.0
And okaywhat is eight times fifty	Four hundred	3.0
And four hundred or forty plus three is what	Forty three	3.0
Everybody understand	Yes	0.0
And then when I started teaching math I was like what is ten times four	Forty	3.0
Forty	Ohhhhhhh	0.0
So now	And if its the hundreds place then you have a two	3.0
And if it was the thousands place	Three	3.0
Four	There you go	3.0
You always add those zeros because you make sure you are in line with the process you are doing	Okay	3.0
Fifty	Oh did I have anything that I needed to carry	3.0
No	No	3.0
You did one times four	So when you put the four there	0.0
So when you put the four there	Good job	1.0
Good job	Okay	3.0
Okay	So now I have one times five equals what	3.0
Five hundred	All right	3.0
Whats two plus zero	Two	3.0
Seven	Whats five plus four	3.0
Nine	I didnt know that that was going to be the same answer	3.0
I had no idea	What is going on	3.0
Dont worry about it being the same answers	Its not a big deal	0.0
Its not a big deal	Okay so now Elijah did your add the zero work	0.0
Good call	Okay	3.0
All right	So now	0.0
Oh they showed us an an area model	Fifty four times eighteen which is really ten and eight	0.0
Landon I want you to try it	Nope I want you to try US traditional	3.0
Just as long as you understand what that bow tie method is	That is the process Im talking about	3.0
Five times seven is	Um thirty five	2.0
Then whats three times five	Fifteen	3.0
Eighteen	Okay now add those two together	3.0
What is thirty seven times twenty	Seven hundred forty	3.0
Whats thirty seven times five	So this is the way I do it	3.0
Carry your three	Whats three times five	3.0
Eighteen	Hey thats not right	3.0
Okay	Oh	3.0
Oh	By hundred and eighty five	1.0
You were right here	Seven plus seven	0.0
but I like to do it like this	Yes as long as youre doing it that is fine	3.0
Im going to use that and show that as an example too	Yes maam	1.0
Hey show me your whiteboards	I want to see where youre at right now	0.0
What am I going to carry over	The three	3.0
Right okay	Now what is five times three	3.0
And what is fifteen plus three	Eighteen	3.0
Im going to carry my what	The one	3.0
		0.0
And six hundred plus one hundred is		3.0
Twelve	Twelve	3.0
What do I have to carry up there	Okay	3.0
I did my one	What is it doing	0.0
Lets see if itll do it	Okay because we Samanthad the one	0.0
But she understood this	She said Oh	0.0
Then she had thirty seven times five is what	One hundred eighty five	3.0
Im going to show you something else real quickly	Let me borrow your white board	3.0
Nine twenty five	Nine twenty five sorry	3.0
My goal and your goal to be successful	Great job	3.0
Excellent	Okay	0.0
Five or more what do we do	Greater than four	3.0
Okay	Because its closer to that value	3.0
Whats eight times six	Eight times six is forty eight	3.0
Sixteen	Is thirty one closer to thirty or forty	3.0
Forty	Okay	3.0
Whats three times four	Twelve	3.0
One thousand two hundred	There you go	3.0
You see how Im estimating	Yes	3.0
I would like you to complete one two three explain how that estimation helped you and I would like you to complete this area model over here	Friends area model is to evaluate	0.0
Yeah I was confused at what she said	Okay do you know what youre doing	0.0
We are going to do this for five ten fifteen twenty minutes	Go	0.0
I only want you solving these three	I dont want you doing these	0.0
Youre doing them	If you would like  let me back up if you know you need to understand in order to be successful on evaluation should you check a couple	0.0
Everybody should have their cameras on right this moment in time	Miss Strathom can I go grab mine	0.0
Miss Strathom can I go grab mine	Its downstairs	0.0
Turn them on	Mines in the basement	0.0
Go	So I did is you showed the two tenths	4.0
So I did is you showed the two tenths	So I did that once	4.0
So I did that once	And then I did it another time	4.0
And then I did it another time	So twice and then three times and then four times and then five times and then six times	4.0
So twice and then three times and then four times and then five times and then six times	And then to help me I did it different colors	4.0
And then to help me I did it different colors	So that I know that it was six times	4.0
So that I know that it was six times	And then I labeled up here	4.0
And then I labeled up here	I said that that was one whole and down here theres 210 and then I added those together and I got I got one one and 210	4.0
Explain that please	Because it was filling the whole entire 100 like 100ths or 10ths	4.0
You are up next	I did pretty much the same thing as Kate	1.0
I did pretty much the same thing as Kate	I knew that	0.0
I knew that	You did one or two tenths with us	4.0
You did one or two tenths with us	And then I did another one	4.0
And then I did another one	So that was two and then three four or five and then sick	4.0
So that was two and then three four or five and then sick	And then like Kate said this whole 100 block is filled up with colors	4.0
And then like Kate said this whole 100 block is filled up with colors	So I know that thats one whole	4.0
Okay thank you	And go ahead Maddy show us what youve done	4.0
And go ahead Maddy show us what youve done	So what Ive done is so each of these boxes are worth 100	4.0
So what Ive done is so each of these boxes are worth 100	And so I have two of these is two tenths	4.0
And so I have two of these is two tenths	So in there needed to be six of them	4.0
So in there needed to be six of them	So I did 12345 and then six down here	4.0
So I did 12345 and then six down here	And so I knew like they did that this was one whole	4.0
And so I knew like they did that this was one whole	So thats how when where I put the one and then I saw that there was two tenths left so that I put the two	4.0
Can you turn your microphone on	Yes	0.0
Explain the reasoning that youre missing on this okay	Im not really getting the like adding	2.0
Do you understand how to color in the 10th part	Yeah	0.0
Haley while Zachs talking put your things up please	I used graph paper	3.0
Great but how did you section that graph paper off	Yeah	0.0
Can you explain how you	Its initially 11 by 11	3.0
Its initially 11 by 11	So	0.0
Help me	Um so what Landon is not getting is like when you do like zero I dont really remember the problem	2.0
It was two tenths times six	Okay it was two tenths	0.0
Okay it was two tenths	So he um hes not adding correctly	1.0
So he um hes not adding correctly	Like when you go over by ten youre supposed to add like one	4.0
123	184 thousandths	0.0
Hello	I can see a little bit of your board	0.0
So Im going to start	I can see the top of your board	0.0
So I know that seven times three equals what Landon	21	3.0
That I have up here that I dont have down here	A decimal point	3.0
So Landon do you know a way I can move the decimal or figure out how to bring the decimal to where I need it	Yeah	0.0
Explain it please	Since were multiplying you have to move it to the right	4.0
I have to move it one right there correct	Yeah	0.0
Could I also have just brought it down in this instance	Yes	0.0
Two and 110	Yes	0.0
Turn your microphone on please	Hello	0.0
Tell me what you did to solve this problem go	Um so I didnt really know what to do	2.0
Um so I didnt really know what to do	So I did 50 times 8	3.0
I cant hear you	I didnt really know what to do so I did like 50 times 8	3.0
Okay what did you get	I got 40	3.0
Okay	And then I put the decimal point behind the four and then I did eight times two which is 16	4.0
And then I put the decimal point behind the four and then I did eight times two which is 16	So then I put the 16 behind the four	4.0
So then I put the 16 behind the four	And I got four and 16100	4.0
Am I correct	Yeah I put it behind the four	3.0
Why did you know to put the decimal after the four Julia	Because it was a multiplying by like a 10th	4.0
How did you write that 16	It looks like this	3.0
Blake do you agree or disagree with her	Agree	1.0
Okay if you all agree give me a thumbs up	I agree	1.0
I agree	But I did it a totally different way	1.0
So Kate explain to me what you did	So I wrote it out like this	4.0
So I wrote it out like this	And I did two times eight is six	4.0
And I did two times eight is six	And then um	0.0
Eight times two is really six	Sorry two times eight is 16	3.0
Sorry two times eight is 16	And so I put down the six and then I carried the one	4.0
And so I put down the six and then I carried the one	And then I did five times eight is 40 and then plus the one and did 41	4.0
And then I did five times eight is 40 and then plus the one and did 41	And then I went down and I added the decimal point and came down like from the place values and went to	4.0
So what type of multiplication did you use here Kate	US traditional	3.0
US traditional and what are we supposed to master by the end of the year	US traditional	3.0
Does that make better sense to you now Julia	Yes	0.0
Explain why it makes better sense now	It makes sense because I did eight times the 10 first when I was supposed to do eight times the one first	4.0
Duncan turn your mic on for me	Yes	0.0
How am I going to write this as a whole number	Im your youre gonna wait what do you mean by write as a whole number	2.0
So how am I going to solve 928 divided by 1000	Um youre gonna um so 928 divided by 1000	0.0
Um youre gonna um so 928 divided by 1000	Um so thered be a decimal point at the end of 928	4.0
Um so thered be a decimal point at the end of 928	And then you would move that um three times cause of the three zeros	4.0
And then you would move that um three times cause of the three zeros	And then it would be 09 28	4.0
How would I read that	Um9281000	3.0
Go	Um so it was the 1000	4.0
Um so it was the 1000	Um the three zeros	4.0
Um the three zeros	Um you would move that three times and then the decimal you would move the decimal three times	4.0
Um you would move that three times and then the decimal you would move the decimal three times	And then	0.0
Is my answer right or wrong Landon	Its wrong	3.0
Make sure theyre talking about place value of the number and how it becomes a whole versus the 10ths hundredths 1000ths Okay	Are we switching off sage and scribe	0.0
I am going to put you into groups of	And then you want us to do the page called San Fran decimals	0.0
Okay	Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes Zach	Do we like should we do ones that we already did with our partner	0.0
Maddy will let you write your name	Yeah it will	0.0
Could you turn your microphone on	Yes	0.0
go ahead	Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	4.0
Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	And they each need to get the same amount	4.0
And they each need to get the same amount	So if I divide if like I give each rabbit or like the six carrots goes into the rabbits twice I guess I	4.0
What did your expression look like	So first I did 8 divided by two plus three	4.0
Why did you do eight divided by two buddy	Nevermind	0.0
Yeah can you	Yeah	0.0
Yeah you do	Um Landon	0.0
Go ahead Landon	Okay so I was a little confused on this one	2.0
Okay so I was a little confused on this one	But I said four divided by two plus three	4.0
Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on	Hello	0.0
Can you walk them through this	Yes	0.0
Yes	So can I explain what I did	0.0
So can I explain what I did	And then walk them through it	0.0
Please do because I need to make sure youre correct	Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	4.0
Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	So you do that first	4.0
So you do that first	And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	4.0
And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	So you need to do that first	4.0
So you need to do that first	And then he has three cages	4.0
And then he has three cages	So I did two plus four in parentheses divided by three	4.0
because you had to divide those rabbits into	Three cages	3.0
Landon turn your microphone back on	Okay	0.0
Tell me what Maddy just said	She said that she did in parentheses four plus two which is six and then shes did six divided by three which is inauidble	4.0
Does that make sense Landon	Yeah	0.0
What Maddy did	Yes	0.0
Where did you come up with 8 buddy	inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	4.0
inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	So now Im actually solving it	0.0
So now Im actually solving it	I dont know where I got eight from	2.0
Turn your microphone on please	Yes	0.0
Tell me what how you solved this	I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds	3.0
John can you explain what you did	Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds	3.0
How can you cut it into thirds John	Well inauidble And I said each person could get 13 of the pizza	3.0
Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on	You can cut them both into thirds	3.0
ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much	Two thirds	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Can you turn your microphone on buddy	Yeah	0.0
So Ethan how did you solve this	I did it	0.0
I did it	I split to six graham crackers in half	4.0
I split to six graham crackers in half	And then so each of them got on one and one half of two graham crackers	4.0
Kate do you agree or disagree with that	Well I did it differently	1.0
One in one half	Um no	1.0
Okay so explain what you did please	Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	4.0
Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	Because there were three people or three friends	4.0
Because there were three people or three friends	Oh I would have to cut it into fourths	4.0
What does that come up with	At first I did it in third	4.0
At first I did it in third	When I did it in thirds	4.0
When I did it in thirds	I got two wholes	4.0
I got two wholes	They would each get two wholes	4.0
They would each get two wholes	But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	4.0
But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	Because I need to do her two	4.0
Because I need to do her two	So they would each get one and a half	4.0
So they would each get one and a half	So yeah now I agree	1.0
Kate what	Its number five	0.0
Or do you need to work with me	I think I have it	0.0
So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between	Oh god	0.0
Oh god	Um three	3.0
What about Mary	Three	3.0
So we have three total people right	Yeah	0.0
Right	Yup	0.0
Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here	Uh you could draw pizza slices maybe and you split it into thirds	3.0
Adam how much pizza did each person get	A third	3.0
So if it would make it easier I could do 13	plus 13 plus 13	3.0
That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam	three thirds or a whole	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah kind of	0.0
What question Can I clarify	I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	0.0
I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	I was just saying kinda cause	0.0
So you were just doing the two you were doing this number	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	I forgot to add the person whos like the first person	3.0
How many days Is she gonna be gone Audrey	Five	3.0
What How am I cutting them into fractions	circles	3.0
Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can	One and a half	3.0
I have my five cans right	three cans	0.0
How many days is she gonna be gone Reese	Five	3.0
so what do I need to divide these cans into	Halfs	0.0
What am I dividing those cans into	Thirds	3.0
Why third	Mrs Strathom I know	0.0
What do I need to divide these cans into	fifths	3.0
fifths	Fifths	1.0
Audrey	because shes gone for five days	4.0
Three what Everybody	Three fifteenths	3.0
Adam why 15ths	cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each	4.0
How many days Is she going to be gone Adam	three fifths	3.0
cameras on	If we didnt Finish Do we finish it for asynchronous	0.0
camera on camera on camera on camera Camera on Camera on	Mom I still have a question	1.0
Whats your question Adam	So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something	4.0
Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get	three fifths	3.0
make sense	Yeah	0.0
And if your camera doesnt go on I did not know youre with me	Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes	They probably still have you muted	0.0
Guys I would use a text box and make sure youre using a white inkWhy will it not let you	I dont get this	2.0
I dont get this	T	0.0
Point seventy 2	I dont get this	2.0
3 times oh youre just doing the math enter number here 21	T can use my white whiteboard for this	0.0
Yes you may	Ms Strathom  I cant type the letters in the box	0.0
What	Its letting me type only the top row	0.0
Its letting me type only the top row	Its letting me check numbers in the top row of the letters but I cant get x	0.0
Are you trying to explain	T I cant What I mean is I cant type x for the times	0.0
Just type the answers in	Okay	0.0
Okay	You wont know if its ours because we cant type letters	0.0
Just type in the answers	T	0.0
Yes	I have a question	2.0
Okay	So when we multiply the like the three tenths times the seven tenths like do we put like the two numbers	2.0
So when we multiply the like the three tenths times the seven tenths like do we put like the two numbers	Like do we put 21 Or just 021	2.0
Is that what you just asked me	Yes	0.0
So if I multiply 300ths times seven tenths Do I really have two holes Maddy	No	0.0
There you go	T	0.0
Im sorry what	T	0.0
Yes maam	Um inaudible so that answers might have to be like smushed together	0.0
Adam do you know what youre doing buddy	Im adding both	3.0
What honey	I said Im adding both of the answers	3.0
So make sure you are writing your answer on your whiteboard	I dont know how to	2.0
I dont know how to	inauidble Thats like way too much	0.0
What are you saying Adam	Im saying like thats its hard	2.0
Okay Julia turn your microphone on	Okay	0.0
Go ahead	I use this I use a sticky note just because my dry erase marker ran out	0.0
I use this I use a sticky note just because my dry erase marker ran out	So I did the twenty one plus the inaudible And when I did that I got to 200 I mean 231000ths and then I added that by the 6 plus 6 the those ones and that and then when I added them all together I got 3007 3000 2376 thousandths	4.0
Okay Landon do you agree and why	Well Im kinda confused	2.0
Thank you	I just dont understand area model inaudible	2.0
Okay so is the purpose right now understanding the area model or adding the decimals together	Adding the decimals together	3.0
Do you see how all of my decimals are in a row	Yeah	0.0
So do you see the difference between your whiteboard and my whiteboard Landon	Yeah	0.0
What did I do that you did not do	I think I started with the biggest number first and then I did  the smallest	3.0
The order I put the numbers in or lining the decimals and place values up	Lining the decimals and place values up	3.0
Can you do that Landon	Yeah	0.0
Okay now what Im going to do is I am going to do this student paced and you are going to work together Im going to keep a group of you with me	Can I work with a group this time	0.0
Everyone needs to join	T	0.0
Yes	I have to go inaiudible	0.0
And guys Im gonna have you do this on your whiteboard and paper rather than on the paradox	T	0.0
Yes	Mine isnt loading and Ive tried to reload it but its not working	0.0
Yes Duncan	Um are you doing like are you doing like the real problem	0.0
Um are you doing like are you doing like the real problem	Because its supposed to be 4700ths	4.0
Landon		3.0
So how youre going to multiply	So how youre going to multiply this is you are going to do seven times seven	3.0
Okay	Which equals 49	3.0
Okay where am I going to put the nine Maddy	You are going to put the nine under zero Itd be 009	3.0
You are going to put the nine under zero Itd be 009	I think	0.0
009  okay so now what am I gonna do with the four the Four Maddy	Um it would be in four tenths	3.0
Um okay so now what am I going to do Maddy	You are going to bring the decimal down and put it in front of the four	3.0
Because remember when we get 28 we had a whole because I had two wholes from my 10th	Yeah	0.0
Does that make sense	That makes sense now	0.0
Oh all right Duncan go tell me what Im doing now	Okay so what you would do next would be for tenths times  one 100ths	3.0
Okay so what you would do next would be for tenths times  one 100ths	And that would equal	3.0
What does that equal	Um it would equal point 5000ths	3.0
But four times one is not five	Oh no its four	3.0
Can you turn your mic on please	Yeah	0.0
sWhat is the next thing I am going to do	You have to do seven tenths times 1100ths	3.0
Do you see	Oh okay	0.0
What is one 100ths times 700ths	Um is it I think its 710 1000ths	3.0
Reese what is the first thing I have to do Reese before I start adding these What do I have to make sure Ive done	Your supposed to inaudible I cant really see your screen that well	0.0
Your supposed to inaudible I cant really see your screen that well	The multiplying part	0.0
No weve already multiplied Reese	Yeah I know but adding	3.0
What am ai doing over here	Adding	3.0
Im doing	Adding	3.0
but what is the First thing I need to make absolutely sure Id done before I start adding these	the decimals are lining up	3.0
decimals or lining up Adam what else do I need to make sure lines up	The numbers	3.0
Okay add your numbers up and be ready to share your answer	I cant see the numbers	0.0
Well if you were doing this Ela with me you should have been writing them down	I am	0.0
I am	I am doing them with you	0.0
Duncan can you share your answer with us	Um so I got 28 850  wait no	3.0
Um so I got 28 850  wait no	Yeah two	3.0
read the numbers to me first	Um so 28 and then 49	3.0
Can you see my screen	I did it like this	3.0
28 0049 0004 00007	Yeah thats what I did	3.0
Okay so what is seven plus zero	plus zero is seven	0.0
whats nine plus four	Um that would be 13 So then carry the one	3.0
Okay whats four plus one	Five	3.0
And alls you will be doing is solving themYou will be writing out what you will be responsible show you what youll be responsible for momentarily	T can we erase our white boards	0.0
So Ryan when you start go ahead	I think an equivalent fraction is like a you can make one fraction and make it different numbers	3.0
Go ahead Kate	So Im explaining what a fraction is	0.0
What what is an equivalent fraction	I think in an equivalent an equivalent fraction is like if the same fraction is broken up into a different amount of parts	3.0
Do you want to add anything to that I agree disagree	Um I think it is I agree with her and I think its the same	1.0
and I am going to ask Gage to turn your microphone on	Um four eighths	3.0
Gage	I dont know	2.0
What did you do	broke it up into half	3.0
So Julia where did you go	I went to the bathroom	0.0
Okay my friends I am assuming you are all back	Miss Strathom it invited me to another breakout room	0.0
You may not turn your camera off	Missy Strathom	0.0
Mhmm	John William Remy was there he just said that you were really glitchy	0.0
Okay so Im going back to and I am going to call on another personMia Turn your microphone on	Hello	0.0
Tell me what you guys get talked about	We talked about how we	0.0
What were your answer	Our answers was um 24th 36ths 48ths 510ths 612ths714ths 816ths 918ths and 1020ths	3.0
What did you have to know Zach	You know what half of whatever number it was	3.0
Zoe you hear me	Well you repeat the question ne more time because Zach was talking and he said it	0.0
And I said Now how did you know that an easier way thinking about number sense about something that you learned when you first started adding numbers together way back in kindergarten first or second grade	Well one plus one is two and two plus two is four	4.0
Well one plus one is two and two plus two is four	And then three plus three is six	4.0
And then three plus three is six	So you know like so on	4.0
Brendan Are you with me	Yeah	0.0
So carter two fifths plus two fifthsWhat answer is that	four fifths	3.0
How come four fifhts are two fifths plus two fifths didnt become four tenths	because you only add the numerator	4.0
Excellent because my denominators are the	same	3.0
Okay so now if Im subtracting eight ninths minus four ninths what is my answer going to be Michael	It would be	0.0
Michael subtract your numerators	49ths	3.0
And how do you know	You are subtracting because it says how much blue plate do you have left	4.0
Julia where are you	Shes not in inaudible	0.0
Okay so Maya will you turn your microphone on please	Yes	0.0
Okay Maya will you please explain your estimate and then how you solved it	Okay so I thought 11 twelfths was closer to a whole than a half and then six twelfths is a half	4.0
Okay so I thought 11 twelfths was closer to a whole than a half and then six twelfths is a half	So then I just subtracted and those two 1212ths minus six twelfths And I ended up with six twelfths	4.0
Turn your microphone on	inauidble	0.0
What	I was grabbing a notebook	0.0
Im sorry	You are muted	0.0
How do you think were gonna figure this out	Um maybe we could do 18 20ths minus 920ths first	3.0
Okay so what o that gives us What	920ths	3.0
Hows that going to help us with our the answer	Maybe we could change it to a one	3.0
Maybe we could change it to a one	I mean a 10	3.0
Blake turn your microphone on please	Ms Strathom work his mic wasnt worth working on breakout room	0.0
Talk to me about what you guys discussed	We didnt really discuss it at all	0.0
Who are you working with	Julia and Blake	0.0
And you didnt discuss anything	No	0.0
Why not	I dont know	0.0
Landon can you please turn your microphone on	Hello	0.0
How are ya	Im good	0.0
Im good	How are you	0.0
Could you please talk to me about what you guys talked about	Yes so I was a little stuck but I think I may have got the right answer	0.0
Okay so tell me what you guys did with estimation	Oh okay	0.0
Oh okay	So for the first one we knew that one and 920ths is closer to a half because 10 is half of 20	4.0
So you said you had one and a half	Yes	0.0
Yes	And then for the next one we said eighteen and 1820ths is closer to a whole	3.0
Am I correct	I dont	0.0
I dont	Youre not sharing your screen	0.0
I thought I was	Its okay	0.0
Im sorry buddy	Its okay	0.0
So now we have the equation one and a half minus one	Yes	0.0
Landon who else was in your group	Mia and Sarah	0.0
can you turn your microphone on	Oh I believe it was Michael and Maya	0.0
what is the first thing we have to do with one and nine twentieths	one and 920ths	0.0
Whats the very first thing I have to do with one and nine twentieths	Um first you have to so you have to look at the numbers and then if	0.0
Do you remember what thats called	mixed number	3.0
Whats that fraction called	improper fraction	3.0
Do you remember how we turn it into an improper fraction	Yeah I think we just so you	0.0
Yeah I think we just so you	So I think my sister told me to do this	0.0
Thats Okay	So I think dad didnt we do that last year	0.0
How much is that one worth	One	3.0
What did you so say	One 20th	3.0
Is that correct	Yes	0.0
And isnt 2920 is the same as one and 920ths	Yes yes	0.0
so here is what I would like you to do	Miss Strathom	0.0
Who is talking	Maddy	0.0
Yes Maddy	I have a question	2.0
Okay	So when youre when youre minusing it or whatever	0.0
So when youre when youre minusing it or whatever	Sorry my brain is going blank right now	0.0
Sorry my brain is going blank right now	Do you have to turn it into an improper fraction	3.0
Because I cant take not 18 away from nine	Okay	0.0
Okay you and I are going to work together	Okay	0.0
I will be right back	Okay	0.0
Alright so Austin turn your mic on	Yeah	0.0
Okay how did you solve inaudible	I rounded five eights to a half	3.0
Excellent	And then seven eight to a whole	3.0
And then seven eight to a whole	Then I added in I got one and a half	3.0
What is the total	One and one half	3.0
	128ths	3.0
What	Another way to do it is 12 minus eight	3.0
Miss Elliot	do we turn our cameras off and then put them back on	0.0
Question	Mrs  Strathom	0.0
Mrs  Strathom	Do we all the same questions	0.0
Okay	Wait Miss Strathom mine says Burt threw a stone one 714th yards	0.0
Wait Miss Strathom mine says Burt threw a stone one 714th yards	Tilly threw a stone 914th of the yard	0.0
Tilly threw a stone 914th of the yard	What is a reasonable estimate of the difference between their two throws	0.0
Okay so make a reasonable estimate	Its probably	0.0
so what are the numbers Adam	One  and714ths	3.0
Okay	and then 914ths	3.0
Then what is a reasonable estimate	I think its one no wait	3.0
I think its one no wait	I think its one yard	3.0
What is that closest to	Two	3.0
Two	Oh okay	0.0
one and 714ths is really what	One and one half	3.0
Is that closer to a hole or a half	A whole	3.0
How many more Do I need to get to a whole with 914ths	I dont know	2.0
What is the difference between nine and 14	You need five	3.0
Whats half of 14	That would be seven	3.0
How many do I need piecewise	Two	3.0
Okay am I closer to a half or a whole	A whole	3.0
I need Five more pieces to get to a whole	a half	3.0
How does one and a half and a half equal two and a half Adam	oh two	3.0
How am I going to turn one and four sixth into an improper fraction	Maybe first we could estimate five sixth to a whole	3.0
You are absolutely right	And then four sixth to a half	3.0
Okay	Then	0.0
So what would be a good estimate for your answer	Maybe	0.0
with one and a half plus one	One and one and one half	0.0
So because hes giving it though were gonna subtract arent we	Yeah	0.0
Because was that one and a half minus one Just a half	Yeah	0.0
Austin how many pieces is that one whole worth	Six sixths	3.0
So if you add six to four how much do you have		3.0
10 Sixth minus five sixth	Yeah	0.0
So Julia what is 818th plus 918ths	Im not good at adding let me think	0.0
Are my denominators the same	Yeah	0.0
So whats eight plus 9		3.0
Whats your answer	1718ths	3.0
Hey Adam where are we up buddy	On the second question and my dad just told me how to do it	0.0
Okay	I still need your help though	2.0
I still need your help though	Cuz	0.0
Whats the question	Okay so it says which statement is true	0.0
Okay so it says which statement is true	Theres four answers	0.0
Theres four answers	Lucy has one and fourth one and four 12ths	0.0
Im sorry Adam read it again	Okay	0.0
Okay	Lucy has one and fourth 12ths cups of grapes	0.0
Lucy has one and fourth 12ths cups of grapes	Don has a one an 1112ths cups of grapes	0.0
Don has a one an 1112ths cups of grapes	together They have two and 712ths cups of grapes	0.0
Do you agree with that or disagree with that	I disagree with that because thats kind of a subtraction problem	4.0
You know if he wants to know all together How much they have wouldnt I be adding them	Yeah	0.0
Read the question to me again	Lucy has one and four 12ths cups of grapes	0.0
Lucy has one and four 12ths cups of grapes	Dawn has one 1112ths cups of grapes	0.0
Dawn has one 1112ths cups of grapes	together they have two and 712 cups of grapes	0.0
Do you agree or disagree with that	I think I agree	3.0
What What do I have to choose an answer between Adam	Oh so for like each one	0.0
Every bit of it	Rachel	0.0
Rachel	Rachel has one 715ths cups of chocolate chips	0.0
Rachel has one 715ths cups of chocolate chips	Maya has eight fifteenths of a cup of chocolate chips	0.0
Maya has eight fifteenths of a cup of chocolate chips	Rachel has 1015ths of a cup of of a cup more chocolate chips than Maya	0.0
How am I talking about	No becuase I thought you were you talking about the second one	0.0
No becuase I thought you were you talking about the second one	Miss Strathom	0.0
Do not get upset	This is hard	2.0
This is hard	What do you do when Youre done	0.0
Dont worry you and I are going to do this later	Okay	0.0
So friends I need you all to come back to me	Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes	Im stuck on how to like estimate the decimal kinda	2.0
Were not estimating decimals	not the decimal like estimate the fraction	2.0
So what are the two numbers buddy	So theres 18 and 20 and then 9 and 20	0.0
Okay so 18 twentieths is closest to a half or a whole	a whole	3.0
and nine twentieths is that closer to a half or a whole	A half	3.0
So your estimate would be one and a half right	Yeah	0.0
Good	Thank you	0.0
Youre welcome	This is hard	2.0
This is hard	I forgot how to do this	2.0
Okay so	At one oclock	0.0
At one oclock	Cuz I need to work with you	2.0
Or the day inauidble	Wait Im not done yet	0.0
Wait Im not done yet	Do I keep working	0.0
And did you finish	No	0.0
Adam you and I will meet at 1245 today	T	0.0
Yes	Can you look at my score cuz i dont know if i still should work with you	0.0
Oh darlin you dont need to work with me	Okay	0.0
youre good	Mrs Strathom	0.0
Yes	For the last for number five It wants Which statements true	0.0
For the last for number five It wants Which statements true	Do I have to do an estimate	2.0
Do I have to do an estimate	Or can I just do the answer	2.0
Austin If you would like to join me later this afternoon You can	Okay	0.0
Well so Charlie apparently you need to come with me this afternoon too cuz youre gonna retake this	T Its just its just its just I couldnt figure out how to do this	0.0
Thats fine buddy	T	0.0
T	I finished	0.0
Okay so we are now going to jump into our writing	Can we put our fraction circles up	0.0
Put your fraction circles away	T	0.0
Yes	I just finished	0.0
Oh good	Can we go back and fix our body paragraph one first	0.0
Show me with a thumbs up if you need to go back and fix your similarities	T	0.0
T	My mom was checking my paper	0.0
My mom was checking my paper	And then me and her did both of the similarities	0.0
And then me and her did both of the similarities	So then she told me I technically have two paragraphs done	0.0
Okay so um it is now time for you to um take a quick little break	What time do you want us back at	0.0
So 10 minutes	Okay bye	0.0
See you in ten	I got a three	3.0
Julia are you back yet	Are we gonna do read aloud	0.0
We are going to do read aloud so you guys may color if you would like	we can have snacks right	0.0
Julia	miss Strathom	0.0
yes	um since we did cookies we also decorated our tree I dont know if you really see it	0.0
um since we did cookies we also decorated our tree I dont know if you really see it	We decorated my grandmas tree	0.0
We decorated my grandmas tree	My grandpa did it too	0.0
Yes Duncan	Oh are you supposed to still record or no	0.0
thumbs up when youre done	Do we need to do all of the problems	0.0
Gage Are you done	Can you go back to the page please	0.0
Turn your microphone on	Okay	0.0
Tell me what are multiples of nine up to 50	s9 1827	3.0
Go ahead		3.0
Go ahead		3.0
Okay and lets go one more		3.0
I just told you what it would be	40 plus 9	3.0
Can you help me with that one Zoe	but Im confused because that makes 49	4.0
So Zoe using that divisor come up with an addition problem Thats gonna get me to 40	s31 plus nine	3.0
Okay so what is our closest divisor to 40		3.0
Okay so if I did 36 what do I have to add to it to get to 40	plus 4	3.0
What does that equal	Four	3.0
I still have to come up with four more dont I	sMhmm	0.0
Ben whats a division problem I could do to get me the for more I need to get to 40	To get more to get	0.0
Ben	four	3.0
So if I divide eight divided by two what does that equal	Four	3.0
Everybody		3.0
Is that making any sense to you guys	Yep	0.0
What numbers can I add together that are going to give me 40	Did we already use 30 10	3.0
Type it in the chat box	Do we write this in our journal	0.0
Can somebody see the chat box	He hasnt said anything	0.0
He hasnt said anything	He hasnt said anything	0.0
He hasnt said anything	I dont get this	2.0
And then I am going to go back to a share real quick	is 40 divided by nine is four with the remainder four	4.0
So please complete the division problem	Do you want us to solve it in partial quotients or us traditional	2.0
Okay Ben	I think I got I got it correct	0.0
I think I got I got it correct	And how I got it correct is I did 833 times 700 which was which was seven times 100	4.0
And how I got it correct is I did 833 times 700 which was which was seven times 100	And I got 133	4.0
And I got 133	Then after that I found my multipliers I then I multiply then I had then I did seven times 10 which was 70	4.0
Then after that I found my multipliers I then I multiply then I had then I did seven times 10 which was 70	And then I got 63	4.0
And then I got 63	And then I did 63 times 63 was which I mean 63 subtracts from 63 and it was zero	4.0
And then I did 63 times 63 was which I mean 63 subtracts from 63 and it was zero	Then I added this the side numbers	4.0
Okay Mr Zach Im gonna come to you	So I did partial products and I got it correct	3.0
So I did partial products and I got it correct	So I did the same thing Josh did	1.0
So I did the same thing Josh did	I did seven times 100 is 700	4.0
I did seven times 100 is 700	So i minus 700 from 833	4.0
So i minus 700 from 833	And I got 133	4.0
And I got 133	And then I did seven times 10 which is 70	4.0
And then I did seven times 10 which is 70	And then that equals 63	4.0
And then that equals 63	And then I knew that 63 was a multiple of seven	4.0
And then I knew that 63 was a multiple of seven	So I just minus that and did 100 plus 10 plus nine to get 119	4.0
or do you like both ways	Im fine with both of them	0.0
Im fine with both of them	Yeah	0.0
Now if you got it wrong	I got it wrong by one	3.0
Turn your camera on sweetie	Can you see me	0.0
No I cannot	My camera is on	0.0
And tell us where you made your mistake	Okay so I I got 120	3.0
Okay so I I got 120	So what I did was I did it like so I did I found I knew that	0.0
So what I did was I did it like so I did I found I knew that	Seven times one gets that close to eight	4.0
Seven times one gets that close to eight	So I wrote seven right here	4.0
So I wrote seven right here	And I minus it and I got and I got one	4.0
And I minus it and I got and I got one	So then I added the three and I got 13	4.0
So then I added the three and I got 13	So then I said then I figured out if seven times something equals 13	4.0
So then I said then I figured out if seven times something equals 13	But I think Im at one over maybe	4.0
But I think Im at one over maybe	So I did two instead of a one	4.0
So I did two instead of a one	Cuz four	4.0
Cuz four	I was doing it	0.0
I was doing it	I did it two above so I put the two up there	4.0
I did it two above so I put the two up there	And then I did I wrote fourteen two here and got zero	4.0
And then I did I wrote fourteen two here and got zero	So I went up by one	4.0
Because if I have 13 if I take away 14 I have a negative number dont I	Yeah	0.0
So yesterday our math message was let me go back to Im going to close that	Can we erase our boards	0.0
May I use yours	Yes	0.0
Thats all Im doing right now and then	i submitted mine	0.0
You need to make sure you do it	Miss Strathom	0.0
Okay show me your whiteboard again buddy	Okay	0.0
Okay	Um its hard to see but I did six divided by 3 6 divided by two	3.0
type them in the chat box	Sorry	0.0
I dont understand why this is being so awful right now	Its number five	0.0
Kate Ill see if this is my number five	Because mine says five partial quotients with multiples	0.0
Because mine says five partial quotients with multiples	And thats what this page is	0.0
Let me try this one	Oh yeah its that one right there	0.0
So Im going to recreate because I only want to have you in a room	You want us to use partial quotients or just us division	2.0
Okay	miss Strathom	0.0
Yes	you us to write it on our paper or our whiteboards	0.0
Okay	inauidble chromebooks	0.0
three minutes what	are doing it on our Chromebook or our Apple Mac Journals	0.0
Mac journals and be able to explain it	Okay	0.0
Alright here we go	I like turtles	0.0
Gage and Matt Why did you not join your groups	I did	0.0
Well how come youre still with me	Nobody else showed and so I left	0.0
So Gage honey Let me move you to another room so you can at least have a conversation	Okay	0.0
Okay John	inaudible we didnt get to finish	0.0
Tell me about the process you started	Still working on it but Ill do it I guess	0.0
Still working on it but Ill do it I guess	Um so what I think Id do well I havent even started the problem	0.0
Um so what I think Id do well I havent even started the problem	Okay so	0.0
why have you not started the problem Adam	Because Im trying to figure out which number goes into 1647	2.0
um Reese how did you guys do	Um I didnt have anybody in my group	0.0
Did you finish it	No	0.0
Im gonna move you back into your group you were with	Emily	0.0
Remy go ahead	What I did was I used 15	3.0
Why did you use 15 Remy	Because 15 times 28 Is 420	4.0
All the way down	Yes	0.0
Okay	long division took a long time for me	0.0
Okay	Were doing 501 slides and test	0.0
who cannot get in	Michael	0.0
Just go ahead and solve these	He said the math	0.0
Turn your camera on please	Hello	0.0
Just a second buddy	Okay	0.0
cameras on	Ms Strathom Im not done	0.0
What is your answer	for six divided by three I got two	4.0
Okay and how did you know that was correct	Well six divided by three would be two because three we know	4.0
three times	Three times two is six	4.0
divided by five	I got five because five times five is 25	4.0
Okay Kate turn yours on please	Okay	0.0
So Kate what did you get for 60 divided by three	I got 20	3.0
And how did you come up How did you verify that	Because three times 20 is 60	4.0
2500 divided by 50	I got 50	3.0
And how did you do that	Because 50 times 50 is 2500	4.0
How did you get What did you get for 600 divided by three	I got 200	3.0
I got 200	Because um its the same as 60 Its same as 60 divided by three but you just add a zero	4.0
Do I add a zero or attach a zero	Attach	3.0
30 times 20 or three times 20 Is what	60	3.0
600 divided by three was		3.0
Because three times 200 equals	Six	3.0
Three times 200 equals what		3.0
Okay Gage what did you get for 5600 divided by 80		3.0
And I want you to tell me what is 80 times seven		3.0
Okay what is 80 times 70		3.0
And you all explained we explained how to do this using partial quotients and regular us traditional long division	Wait Miss Strathom did did we do that	0.0
You should have it was in Fridays asynchronous lesson	No	0.0
if if you finished your work on Friday Yes you did do it	No Ms Strathom	0.0
No Ms Strathom	You took it out of asynchronous before some people could do it	0.0
So you should have gone and checked because I put it back in by ah 145 because Ethans mom sent me an email saying that I needed to put it back in so I did put it back in	inaudible	0.0
Nope Im gonna go back to that	Do you want us to write this down	0.0
Okay	Ms Strathom  is it page 67	0.0
	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you want us to write these on our whiteboard	0.0
Using partial quotients	Ms Strathom	0.0
Yes	I am confused	2.0
I am confused	Where did you like why did you put the one next to the two at the top	2.0
Its in my ones right	Yeah	0.0
Remember I have to use all the numbers within the dividend	Yeah	0.0
Does that make sense Maddy	Yeah	0.0
Does it make better sense when I give you the arrows Maddy	Yeah	0.0
Yes Maya	Why did you do it times 20	2.0
So 11 times 20 would be 220 which got me closer to my dividend	Okay thank you	0.0
Please put your blue hand up	Can we use our boards	0.0
So the rest of you are telling me you want to stay with me	Yes I need extra help	2.0
I would solve that talk about how we did it and how we checked our answer	Okay we all solve it separate and then we all talk about how we each did it	0.0
Okay Landon what part are you struggling with	Im struggling all the steps in the process	2.0
Can you all see this	Yes	0.0
Maya go ahead	I kinda still dont understand how youve figured out which number to do it to get five like at the top to get the first five like 55	2.0
Okay so youre not understanding why I put the number up here	Im not understanding how you knew how to get that number	2.0
Oh I multiplied my divisor times that number	Okay	0.0
Do not fret because Im not sending you all the way unknown	Ms Strathom	0.0
Yes	so Im inaudible number three and 3718 divided by 30	4.0
so Im inaudible number three and 3718 divided by 30	And I got 117 remainder eight	4.0
You are correct Adam	Yes	0.0
waiting here	Wait Is it for asynch	0.0
Okay	Ms Strathom	0.0
Yes Kate	so what are these like cube things for	0.0
Thats for you to do your work in	Oh do we have to do it on that	0.0
If we were in class that I could look at those	Ill do it on the grid	0.0
Ill do it on the grid	I only did one on my whiteboard which I think you guys already solved that	0.0
Adam Do you have a question	Um yeah	0.0
Um yeah	So my mom and I think I have this down	0.0
Okay	Miss Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes Maddy	Um so can I come with you at one because I thought I had it but Im actually very confused	2.0
Maddy will let you write your name	Yeah it will	0.0
Could you turn your microphone on	Yes	0.0
go ahead	Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	4.0
Um I did six divided by two because it says that theyre six carrots and he has two rabbits	And they each need to get the same amount	4.0
And they each need to get the same amount	So if I divide if like I give each rabbit or like the six carrots goes into the rabbits twice I guess I	4.0
What did your expression look like	So first I did 8 divided by two plus three	4.0
Why did you do eight divided by two buddy	Nevermind	0.0
Yeah can you	Yeah	0.0
Yeah you do	Um Rogan	0.0
Go ahead rogan	Okay so I was a little confused on this one	2.0
Okay so I was a little confused on this one	But I said four divided by two plus three	4.0
Okay Maddy can you turn your microphone on	Hello	0.0
Can you walk them through this	Yes	0.0
Yes	So can I explain what I did	0.0
So can I explain what I did	And then walk them through it	0.0
Please do because I need to make sure youre correct	Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	4.0
Okay so what I did is I did two plus four in parentheses	So you do that first	4.0
So you do that first	And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	4.0
And I knew to do that because he had two rabbits but he get it Hes getting four more	So you need to do that first	4.0
So you need to do that first	And then he has three cages	4.0
And then he has three cages	So I did two plus four in parentheses divided by three	4.0
because you had to divide those rabbits into	Three cages	3.0
Landon turn your microphone back on	Okay	0.0
Tell me what Maddy just said	She said that she did in parentheses four plus two which is six and then shes did six divided by three which is inauidble	4.0
Does that make sense Landon	Yeah	0.0
What Maddy did	Yes	0.0
Where did you come up with 8 buddy	inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	4.0
inaudible Eight plus three divided by two	So now Im actually solving it	4.0
So now Im actually solving it	I dont know where I got eight from	2.0
Turn your microphone on please	Yes	0.0
Tell me what how you solved this	I solved this what I did a pizza and I cut it into thirds	3.0
John can you explain what you did	Well when inauidble I cut the pizza into thirds	3.0
How can you cut it into thirds John	Well inauidble And I said each person could get 13 of the pizza	3.0
Mr Gage Thompson Turn your microphone on	You can cut them both into thirds	3.0
ameesha gets 13 plus 13 equals How much	Two thirds	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Can you turn your microphone on buddy	Yeah	0.0
So Ethan how did you solve this	I did it	0.0
I did it	I split to six graham crackers in half	4.0
I split to six graham crackers in half	And then so each of them got on one and one half of two graham crackers	4.0
Kate do you agree or disagree with that	Well I did it differently	1.0
One in one half	Um no	1.0
Okay so explain what you did please	Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	4.0
Okay so what I did was I cut all six graham crackers into thirds	Because there were three people or three friends	4.0
Because there were three people or three friends	Oh I would have to cut it into fourths	4.0
What does that come up with	At first I did it in third	4.0
At first I did it in third	When I did it in thirds	4.0
When I did it in thirds	I got two wholes	4.0
I got two wholes	They would each get two wholes	4.0
They would each get two wholes	But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	4.0
But now that I think of it I would have to split it into fourths	Because I need to do her two	4.0
Because I need to do her two	So they would each get one and a half	4.0
So they would each get one and a half	So yeah now I agree	1.0
Kate what	Its number five	0.0
Are you gonna work with me	Ill work with you	0.0
So Adam How many people are we splitting this pizza between	Oh god	0.0
Oh god	Um three	3.0
What about Mary	Three	3.0
So we have three total people right	Yeah	0.0
Right	Yup	0.0
Okay so Adam What kind of a picture Could I draw here	Uh you could draw  pizza slices maybe and you split it into thirds	3.0
Adam how much pizza did each person get	A third	3.0
So if it would make it easier I could do 13	plus 13 plus 13	3.0
That gives me one 13 plus 13 plus 13 equals what Adam	three thirds or a whole	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah kind of	0.0
What question Can I clarify	I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	0.0
I mean I was kind of confused on well I wasnt confused on anything	I was just saying kinda cause	0.0
I was just saying kinda cause	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	I forgot to add the person whos like the first person	3.0
How many days Is she gonna be gone Audrey	Five	3.0
What How am I cutting them into fractions	circles	3.0
Im asking how many pieces are going to be an each can	One and a half	3.0
I have my five cans right	three cans	3.0
How many days is she gonna be gone Reese	Five	3.0
so what do I need to divide these cans into	Halfs	3.0
What am I dividing those cans into	Thirds	3.0
Why third	Mrs Strathom I know	0.0
What do I need to divide these cans into	fifths	3.0
fifths	Fifths	1.0
Audrey	because shes gone for five days	4.0
Three what Everybody	Three fifteenths	3.0
Adam why 15ths	cuz you put three cans and theirs five in each	4.0
How many days Is she going to be gone Adam	three fifths	3.0
cameras on	If we didnt Finish Do we finish it for asynchronous	0.0
camera on camera on camera on camera Camera on Camera on	Mom I still have a question	2.0
Whats your question Adam	So I dont um I thought it was 15th because I thought we Were doing addition but is this like division or something	4.0
Well Adam if you had 5 10 15 pieces and you divided it by three what do you get	three fifths	3.0
make sense	Yeah	0.0
And if your camera doesnt go on I did not know youre with me	Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes	They probably still have you muted	0.0
One stick of clay shared by four people one watermelon shared by 12 people	So are we	0.0
Explain how you did it and why you did what you did	One fruit bar shared by three people	0.0
One fruit bar shared by three people	I said one third because theres one fruit bar and theyre dividing it between three people	4.0
Okay Layla do number two	I said four fourths but I think its one fourth because each person would get one	4.0
What made you think four fourths	Because theyre dividing into four and each persons taking one so its four fourths	4.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
Remember who can tell me what our daily affirmation was this morningWhat was it	To wait is daily affirmation the message on the	0.0
Yeah on the morning thing in the corner	To write like	0.0
No no go ahead Elijah	Making mistakes helped me learn	3.0
I dont	Learn	3.0
And then Connor what did you do for number three buddy	I got 112	3.0
You got Im sorry what	112	3.0
Okay and why did you do 112 kiddo	Because each person gets 112 of the watermelon	4.0
Okay Ben what did you do for three containers of paint shared by 10 people	What I did is I took the denominator of 10 and the numerator of 3 because they have three cans of paint and 10 people	4.0
I have three containers of paint shared by 10 people	I did three thirds	3.0
Because where why would I use three as my numerator and my denominator	I dont know	2.0
Tom would you or Ben would you explain that again to me please	I put ten as the denominator because there were ten people and three as the numerator because there were three containers of paint	4.0
What did he do	He said he used ten as the denominator	1.0
Why	Because there were ten people and three cans of paint	4.0
Tell me what you did for the second one	Okay so what I did for the second one was I did two ninths because theres two containers as the numerator and then I said ninths	4.0
Okay so what I did for the second one was I did two ninths because theres two containers as the numerator and then I said ninths	Nine people as the denominator and I got two ninths	4.0
Harper what did you do for the third one	I used eight as my denominator because theres	3.0
Why is it blank	Cause I erased it	0.0
Explain what you did sir	I used eight as my denominator because theres eight people	4.0
I used eight as my denominator because theres eight people	I used six as my numerator because six apples	4.0
Once youve got it stand up	That should be a famous quote	0.0
It should be a famous quote	Take a breath dude	0.0
Oh here you go like really open your eyes	My eyes are always open	0.0
So what would three halves be do you think	The same place as Landon said	1.0
Because three halves is really	One and a half	3.0
Agree	Yes	1.0
Could you step up in friends	Can we put our whiteboards away	0.0
Um I think you can put your whiteboards away	What about math journals	0.0
Youre gonna need your math journals	Okay	0.0
We are only doing A Divide this number line to show thirds	You had to click the pencil	0.0
I did	Do it on the right	0.0
Do it on the right	Like not	0.0
Im gonna give everybody a few more seconds	So only number one	0.0
Bring your sheet	On the left	0.0
What would my zero be	Zero	3.0
Zero what	Zero three	3.0
Now what would that one be	That would be one	3.0
Excellent	Thats one	3.0
Or what would it be in a fraction	Zero thirds	3.0
Excellent job	It would be four	3.0
Notice that I made him start with zero thirds	Are we supposed to leave all those on our papers	0.0
Then two thirds then three thirds or a whole then four thirds which is one and a third and five thirds which is one and two thirds and six thirds which is	Two	3.0
Two	Two wholes	1.0
So now	And then hit yes	0.0
It will be easier	Can we pass one	0.0
And it should be writing thin	Its much easier too if you divide it into thirds	4.0
Its much easier too if you divide it into thirds	And then divided each one into half	4.0
Or not Nate Tom would you come and label those	Is it six	3.0
Penelope did I give you yours	Yeah	0.0
Everybody	Gary	3.0
Be ready to share in 54321 go	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I know a number line because how so	0.0
Go ahead	Put a one	3.0
Put a one	And then another way is	0.0
Why would I put two	A one and a two	3.0
Does the question make sense	Yes	0.0
Elijah tell us what you think	So what you can do is you can put the two number lines right up next to each other	4.0
So what you can do is you can put the two number lines right up next to each other	And you can see that the the Gary one on top the dot is further along which means that if you ran further	4.0
Abby	Yeah I agree with Elijah	1.0
Yeah I agree with Elijah	But what I could add is like when you Yeah like its like you can see	0.0
Can you talk about the fraction pieces the size	Yes	0.0
Yes	So on the top one Gary ran one and two thirds	4.0
So on the top one Gary ran one and two thirds	And you can see that because theres the one and then its two thirds over	4.0
And you can see that because theres the one and then its two thirds over	And then Lenna ran seven sixths because you can see the one and then theres one more six	4.0
And what is it closer to	The one	3.0
Its closer to the whole isnt it	Yeah	0.0
When youve got those done please stand up	Just problem four	0.0
Go	I was I said Dans because I said I know Dans is  because I know Rachels is one whole and one half	4.0
I was I said Dans because I said I know Dans is  because I know Rachels is one whole and one half	That would be right here and here	4.0
That would be right here and here	But Dans is two and a half	4.0
But Dans is two and a half	Because theres a whole right here	4.0
Because theres a whole right here	And then theres a whole right here but it goes off the number line so that I know that theres one more	4.0
And then theres a whole right here but it goes off the number line so that I know that theres one more	So that would be a half	4.0
So that would be a half	Yeah	1.0
Struggling	No I got it	0.0
How do you know	It looks like we both have that Dans is taller	1.0
Explain to me why Dans is taller	Because Dans is Rachels plant is one and one fourth	4.0
Where should I put a dot	Where the five fourths is	3.0
Okay am I talking about Rachel or am I talking about Dan	Rachel	3.0
Is this correct	Yes	0.0
William explain to me where Im going to put Dan	Dan is five fourths	3.0
How many total halves do I have on my line	Four	3.0
you see some numbers going up	Yeah	0.0
So if I rename rename a mixed number Elijah what is that called	a	0.0
Phone a friend Friend	Uh Landon	0.0
Uh Landon	is called a improper fraction	3.0
All right	All right	0.0
Okay	This doesnt work	0.0
This doesnt work	Oh yeah it does	0.0
two thirds what is it closer to	You mean three halves	3.0
go	Oh so like a whole or a mix number	2.0
Is it closer to two holes three holes	Okay	0.0
Okay	I get it now cuz I wrote the answer down and I was like inauidble	3.0
I get it now cuz I wrote the answer down and I was like inauidble	So no halves right	1.0
So no halves right	no and it should be like one and two three and four five and six	1.0
no and it should be like one and two three and four five and six	Oh	0.0
Oh	Okay	0.0
Okay	So Like	0.0
So Jackson Why is the first one between one and two	The reason why its between one and two is because the 10th um inaudible and then three inauidble and a half	4.0
The reason why its between one and two is because the 10th um inaudible and then three inauidble and a half	inaudible	0.0
between two and three	Well uh two times two is two times two is Four	4.0
Well uh two times two is two times two is Four	And that takes away a whole so you have one and one half	4.0
And that takes away a whole so you have one and one half	So since its one and half its more than one so its two	4.0
So since its one and half its more than one so its two	Its in between two and three	4.0
Whats the mix number of five halves	One and one half	3.0
He had it but then he forgot the other one Explain to him why its two and one half	Because Because two can go into 5 twice so that would be 4 and then you would have a half extra	4.0
How many sets of three are in seven	Two	3.0
So it would be two and	one	3.0
Whats the denominator on it	Third	3.0
Lets do one more set	Dude	0.0
Dude	Youre insane	0.0
Youre insane	Youre like Harry Houdini	0.0
There you go	Oh my goodness	0.0
Stand when youre done	Im guessing bro	0.0
This is where if you know your multiplication facts this is so much easier	Im just looking at the number chart	0.0
I can not stress the importance of multiplication facts	Its a lot harder inauidble	0.0
Okay	No hold on	0.0
mixed number first	inauidble five and a half	3.0
So what does it fall between	Five and inauidble	3.0
Hold up mixed number first	I didnt really do the mixed number	0.0
Its very easy	Im just guessing	0.0
How many threes are in 17	inaudible	0.0
Okay so what does it make it between	Five and six	3.0
Michael what is the last one whole number or mixed number first please	Um it would be so the answer	0.0
Im sorry what	The answer	0.0
How many fours are in 26	Six	3.0
Six and how many are leftover	Two	3.0
So what does it fall between	Six and seven	3.0
Okay so did we rename a mixed number	Yes	0.0
Did we use a benchmark	Yes	0.0
Now were going to go into the learning objective and the inaudible	Hello	0.0
Hello	Haha	0.0
So should I just have an answer on my board	No	0.0
there you go	Miss Strathom	0.0
Yes	My marker ran out	0.0
When you got an answer please stand up	Sorry	0.0
Sorry	Oh no no no	0.0
sanitize my hands when youre gonna get hand sanitizer all over it	I dont know what to do	2.0
If you were able to make a if you were actually able to at this moment in time just have the mixed number stand	I think I do	0.0
Could you come and show us your board	Yup	0.0
Explain what you did	Okay so for the number I got four and one fifth And so I did that because I put five boxes and I split them into fifths	4.0
Okay so for the number I got four and one fifth And so I did that because I put five boxes and I split them into fifths	So there was one fifth two fifth	4.0
So there was one fifth two fifth	I mean sorry	0.0
I mean sorry	One hole two whole three whole	4.0
One hole two whole three whole	and then one fifth	4.0
So those of you that were struggling with the picture do you see what she did	Yup	0.0
Did you draw a picture	Yeah	0.0
Did She showed us how she broke it apart	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yup	1.0
Yup	No	1.0
No	No	1.0
why not	No because theres inaudible	0.0
What are the number models not	Labeled	3.0
Now were going to go into	math message	0.0
math message	Or not math message	0.0
Ava what did you say	I said so I said that the one tool is a	3.0
first time either yes or no	Yes	0.0
And why	because one full is equals five fifths and then if you add 55ths to 165ths you get 21	4.0
Okay or I can subtract	Thats what I did	0.0
215ths and if I take a whole out of that what do I get	165ths	3.0
165ths	One 165ths	1.0
Im going to give you a few seconds to think about it	Using what	0.0
To get the two wholes	I  subtracted inauidble	0.0
Excellent	And then I got the eleven fifths and I just added inauidble and it was 21	3.0
Pardon me	I didnt get to share	0.0
Did you have the same thing they have	No	0.0
Okay answer what did you have	We put we didnt	0.0
We put we didnt	He was answering the first problem	0.0
He was answering the first problem	And so I was trying to tell him we were on a different problem	0.0
What did you have Harmony	I got two and eleven fifths	3.0
Because that is absolutely right	I got the same answer as her	1.0
When I asked if you have the same answer you said no	Because she said no you couldnt put it into two	4.0
Because she said no you couldnt put it into two	So I was	0.0
Oh that is not what you had in the beginning	And she said no you couldnt put it into two because I got 2 and eleven fifths	4.0
When it was your turn to share what did you share	I shared that I got 2 and 115ths	3.0
So can I break it into three	Yes	0.0
Can I broke it into four	Yes	0.0
5 times one is	One	3.0
One	Five	1.0
five times two is	Ten	3.0
five times three is	Fifteen	3.0
five times four is	Twenty	3.0
If I take it in four times how much do I have left	One	3.0
Did you do it	Wait so we can do an improper right	3.0
whatever you would like as long as the denominator is three	Do we just write the answer	0.0
I would like you if it came down easy to you write It two different ways	Oh No	0.0
Oh No	Two different ways	0.0
Two different ways	I did 113rds	3.0
I did 113rds	Wait can it be any mixed number or have to be with numerator	2.0
I need to see	inauidble	0.0
I just wanted to see that	I didnt get to a mixed number	0.0
Go ahead	So I got so first I did 11 and 33rds	3.0
How about 11 thirds	Oh sorry 113rds	3.0
And howd you get 113rds	By putting all the wholes into a	3.0
numerator	Numerator	0.0
an improper	Mixed number	3.0
No you took the mixed number and turned all the sholes into the improper fraction	Yeah	0.0
Okay	And then I got and then I put one of the wholes	3.0
starts with an N	Numerator	3.0
numerator	And I got 2 and 53rds	3.0
Landon show us what you got	So I didnt get a mixed number	0.0
So I didnt get a mixed number	was 113rds and what I did for that was I well this is easier for me to get the improper	3.0
was 113rds and what I did for that was I well this is easier for me to get the improper	What I did is I did inauidble 3 whole times the three denominator and then I got nine and I did plus two	4.0
Yes sir	Theres another one	0.0
Whats one more	I know	0.0
I know	One and 83rds	3.0
I think	I think I can teach it	0.0
I would like you to turn to page		0.0
ninety in your	I was so close	0.0
Does that make sense	yeah	0.0
How many wholes	Two	3.0
Now how many do I need to show this	inauidble three	3.0
Color it in	11	3.0
inauidble Is 11 fourths the exact same as 2 and 34ths	Yes	0.0
Okay because if I do four times two what does that equal	inauidble	0.0
Does that make better sense	Uh huh	0.0
What	I finish this page first right	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	I dont get it when it says break inaudible	2.0
So can that really be five halves	No	0.0
Because that is not	I got 114ths ofr my mixed number	3.0
Okay so why did you not just put 11 fourths down there	Because it said break apart one to four fourths	4.0
that wants you to draw a picture	Oh	0.0
Oh	So draw four squares and put 11s in them	3.0
So draw four squares and put 11s in them	inauidble four fourths	3.0
Did I just model that	Yes	0.0
Thats what its asking you	it is that the same thing is making a picture	3.0
How many do I can I do that	I believe you can do wait find another name for fourteen thirds	3.0
I believe you can do wait find another name for fourteen thirds	4 and two thirds	3.0
Show me how you did that using thirds	Okay so what I did is I would draw three squares	3.0
Why 3	14	3.0
14	Wow	0.0
break those into thirds for me	Okay	0.0
Okay now show me 14 thirds in those	Go right below or color them in	2.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
How many is that	Thats a whole	3.0
But how many total	Three	3.0
Okay	Six	3.0
Okay		3.0
do I have 14 yet	No	0.0
What do I have to do to get 14	Draw another circle	3.0
draw another circle		3.0
Okay so now what is that	Thats a whole	3.0
Or	three thirds	3.0
So write three thirds	plus three thirds plus three thirds plus three thirds	3.0
plus three thirds plus three thirds plus three thirds	And then plau three thirds and then a plus two thirds	3.0
Okay so what is another name for that	four and 23rds	3.0
Keep going	Okay	0.0
And it makes me sad	Am I supposed to do this	0.0
Almost	Im confused on what to do	2.0
Yeah how many wholes do I need to make it seven fifths	Um one	3.0
is one and 75ths equal to four and two fifths	No	0.0
Did they take away a whole here and add it back in here	Yeah	0.0
So what would this whole now be	Three	3.0
Okay so how many	inauidble	0.0
How many times did they have to add that in	inauidble	0.0
Okay so do three seven fifths	I put the wrong number in inauidble	0.0
Yes	Are we supposed to do the bottom two	0.0
Yeah you do the whole page	Two equals ten	4.0
Two equals ten	because if they turned it	4.0
Im breaking them into fourths what is wrong with me	That would mean that  taken away	3.0
Okay so now this one how many wholes do I have	Four	3.0
Okay so this would be	One and 7 halves	3.0
does that make better sense	I think this one is right	0.0
Oh and it was good	Yes	0.0
How many do I have left	inauidble	0.0
And to get to nine I had to do How many	Two	3.0
How many Am I going to add to eight to get to nine	One	3.0
Cuz if it doesnt let me know	I get it	0.0
Yes friends	I am confused onthis one	2.0
Harmony are you doing okay or you need some help	Im done with that	0.0
So keep doing the rest	Im confused	2.0
What are you confused on	The next page	2.0
Alyssa do you get the next page	Yeah	0.0
And five halves how many bananas does Mojo have	Oh I thought it meant five half bananas so like five bananas split in half	3.0
So let me see something very quickly to make sure Im explaining this right	Can I help Ethan	0.0
So how many bananas does he have	He has four and five halves	3.0
DO they have the same	Yeah	0.0
So are you done with the first page	Yes	0.0
Okay Michael would you come meet with cannon please just to verify pages	Alyssa helped me but Im still a little confused	2.0
We have four friends	So what Im doing is I have the three miles inauidble and I split into fourths because theres four friends	4.0
Yeah	and then for the division of our model I distributed by inauidble to get three fourths I think	4.0
and then for the division of our model I distributed by inauidble to get three fourths I think	So that would be the fraction right inauidble but you cant divide that	4.0
It wont go in there but will 4 go into 30	Yes	0.0
How many times	Eight	3.0
How about 7	Oh 7 sorry	0.0
So Seven	inauidble two	3.0
This ones gonna run that one	You have 4 friends	3.0
and these two friends this one each get a half then each of them is gonna get one	one and one fourth	3.0
Amy come over here	It doesnt make sense to me	2.0
So how many do I need to split these three miles into	Four	3.0
Four	one and nine fourths	3.0
How many miles are they each going to run	1234	0.0
Okay	Wait wait so whats the numbers	2.0
So if you finished all of page one and were truly working on the second page stand up	I only have  and 6 done	0.0
Okay have a seat	I only did 3	0.0
Landon Why didnt you get to it	Because we were waiting for you because we didnt understand it	2.0
And is it recording	Yes	0.0
What does it have to be	It has to be	0.0
Do you want phone a friend	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	It has to be even	3.0
Now what does my denominator have to be in order to add fractions	The same	3.0
The same so if I understand equivalent fractions might I understand how to change the denominator so that theyre even	It either has to be equivalent or it has to like meet into each other like six and two	3.0
But are they equivalent to each other	No	0.0
No	Oh yeah	3.0
Eric what are you doing bud	A dead marker	0.0
I cant have you just sit there you have to ask	May I get a new marker	0.0
So is three fourths bigger or one half	34ths	3.0
How do you know that	Because 12 is only half of a whole and 34ths is almost a whole	4.0
Excellent job	And 24ths is	3.0
Alyssa I need you to let them do the talking and then when I say can you add to it Okay	Okay	0.0
I do want to know what you said	24ths would be the half	3.0
Hunter explain the next one	Okay um	0.0
38ths or 12	I said one half because 38ths is not even half  38ths	4.0
And Rylan do the last one please	I said 23rds because 23rds is bigger than one half	4.0
Dear Lord Im looking right at you buddy going I know I called on someone else	after we	0.0
So what is one four plus two fourths	34ths	3.0
So what do I have to do add to my half to make it bigger than three fourths	Should we stand up when were done	0.0
Sit down when youre done	Oh ok	0.0
You guys are like shes crazy	My moms crazier	0.0
Harmony tell me the first one a four plus two fourths equals	34ths	3.0
And what did you put to make it bigger than that	Like what size	0.0
A half another plus	Another	0.0
Do we agree	Yeah	1.0
Okay Because	Wait what	0.0
What its doing is its adding it and is it bigger than a half	Its the same as last	3.0
Its the same as last	Yeah	1.0
So its the same	Oh okay	0.0
Is 28ths plus 18th  less than or greater than	Less than	3.0
A third plus a third	Greater than	3.0
Place of fourth piece next to an eighth piece	MsStrathom I have the things written down	0.0
You are right I do	Yellow	0.0
So yellow and whats in an eight	An eighth is dark blue	3.0
Okay so pull out your red fraction circle	A yellow	3.0
John where are your fraction circles	I dont know	0.0
Okay go ahead explain what you did here	So the problem said to have a whole which is here in the red and to have one fourth which is black and then an eighth	4.0
So the problem said to have a whole which is here in the red and to have one fourth which is black and then an eighth	And then it said to color the rest so I did a couple more to fill it in	4.0
Oh you disagreeGo ahead John what do you disagree with	Well I disagree because I dont I didnt see in the problem where it said could fill the rest of it up with eighths	4.0
Well I disagree because I dont I didnt see in the problem where it said could fill the rest of it up with eighths	So what I did is I put my fourth next to my eighth and Ive seen that it looked like a third	4.0
So what I did is I put my fourth next to my eighth and Ive seen that it looked like a third	Because you could fit three of those in there	4.0
Because you could fit three of those in there	So I put	0.0
Three of your eight pieces in there	No three of them combined	3.0
No three of them combined	Like three together	3.0
Like three together	together	1.0
together	It makes a third	1.0
It makes a third	Yeah	1.0
Zach what do you think	I think that it equals a third because I put the yellow and the blue together and then a third on top and it filled in perfectly	4.0
I think that it equals a third because I put the yellow and the blue together and then a third on top and it filled in perfectly	I think it equals 25ths because I put 25ths on top and it fit pretty good	4.0
Does it have to fit pretty good or exact	Exact	3.0
Okay but did it fit exactly	No	0.0
No	I think so	1.0
Yes maam	I got 13rd too	3.0
John	Um so you could so if youre adding you can put them together and see what its like see how much it is together	3.0
What do you think Alyssa	28ths is equal to 14th	3.0
So it takes how many eighths to equal a fourth	Two	3.0
So whats my common denominator	Eight	3.0
You two are going to work together you too	Okay so what I think is that if I take a half and put one fourth that wouldnt correctly really fit there so if I put	4.0
Explain to me what youre thinking	Two halves plus two fourths so um	3.0
ask him questions	So two fourths equals a half	3.0
So two fourths equals a half	So two fourths plus one fourth	3.0
Were gonna start when you and your partners are done go to a 0	Three fourths	3.0
Okay so Hunter what do we start out with	A half	3.0
And then what did you set down	To a half	3.0
Excellent	And then it said plus one fourth so we put the fourth one	4.0
And then it said plus one fourth so we put the fourth one	And then we took the half out of there	4.0
And then we took the half out of there	And then we got three fourths	4.0
Olivia	Im sorry	0.0
Stand up when you and your partner are done	The top is one so its two tenths	3.0
The top is one so its two tenths	Its one fifth	1.0
Its one fifth	Two tenths	1.0
Two tenths	One plus one equals	1.0
What did you not understand	I dont understand the problem because 110 is half of a fifth	4.0
And what did you say	I said add 15	3.0
Why am I adding 15	Because it says to add one fifth up there	4.0
So Luke doesnt understand why its not one half	Because 15 goes into 110 goes into one fifth twice so then	4.0
How many 15 pieces does it take to make a tenth	Two	3.0
So what is my answer everyone	Three tenths	3.0
Why three tenths	Because you have to add another 10th	4.0
Because you have to add another 10th	Two units is equal to a tenth	4.0
Two units is equal to a tenth	I mean a fourth is equal to a tenth and you have to add another 10th	4.0
Where did you get it	Old Navy	0.0
Is this making sense to both of you	Yes	0.0
I love that	We still had it	0.0
Now add another three eighths to it	Doesnt really make sense	2.0
No because you are right there is a much easier way to do this	Are you going to do teach us the easier way	0.0
I need you to two thirds plus one sixth and come up with the answer	Okay	0.0
Oh so then write about a half	Add another one and make a half	4.0
Add another one and make a half	So that would be 710	4.0
So that would be 710	I dont have twelfths	0.0
I dont have twelfths	I dont think I have twelfths	0.0
I dont think I have twelfths	this is	0.0
this is	Three tenths	3.0
Three tenths	And then	0.0
And then	Three tenths of	3.0
Three tenths of	Seven tenths	1.0
Seven tenths	Seven tenths	1.0
Seven tenths	Okay	0.0
Okay	So whats worth one twelfth	2.0
So whats worth one twelfth	All right	0.0
Bump bada bump bump	Bump bump	0.0
Okay Zoe John come here	Okay	0.0
Everyone should be facing forward	First we were confused because we tried to put fourths but it didnt fill it up	3.0
First we were confused because we tried to put fourths but it didnt fill it up	So we had to see what other piece have we had to fill it up	3.0
Which was	One twelfth	3.0
What did you have to get before you could go any further	We had to find the common denominator and its twelve	4.0
We had to find the common denominator and its twelve	So now we have to turn the two sixths and one fourth into	4.0
What is my problem again	Two fourths plus	3.0
One fourth plus two sixths	Yes	0.0
Zach come and show them what we did	Okay	0.0
Okay	So we had one fourth and then two sixths	4.0
So we had one fourth and then two sixths	and we figures out the common denominator is twelve	4.0
and we figures out the common denominator is twelve	And I know that four times three	4.0
So put your common denominator 12 over to the side like I did remember when I did I put 12 over here and drew a line and 12 over here and drew a line only because theyll be able to see the process okay	Okay we figured out that four times three is twelve so it would be times three	4.0
Okay we figured out that four times three is twelve so it would be times three	And then we have to do the same thing to the one so we do that times three right and three times one is three	4.0
And then we have to do the same thing to the one so we do that times three right and three times one is three	So this one is three twelfths and then six times two is 12	4.0
So this one is three twelfths and then six times two is 12	And then I do the same thing on top which is four and then I have to add the three and the four which is seven so its seven	4.0
And then one times three equals	Three	3.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
But you got this	Could be technically	0.0
Does that make sense	I did this but we only have one fourth so can I add just one fourth	3.0
So what is my common denominator	Twelve	3.0
So if you laid that down there how many twelfths is it gonna take	Three	3.0
Is it gonna take three or is it gonna take four	Oh yeah four	3.0
Now how many thirds	Four	3.0
So now I have 312 plus 412 which is what	Seven	3.0
So what piece did I have to use	Eighth	3.0
Fourth isnt gonna do it	Makes no sense	2.0
So whats my common denominator	Ten	3.0
So how many tens do I need to fill up a fifth	Two	3.0
All right good	We got two wrong	0.0
Is it going to be closest to a half one one and a half or two	A half	3.0
Okay is two thirds bigger than a half	1Um yes	0.0
Yeah its bigger than a half	Its going to be closer to one	3.0
I have 18 and 14	A half	3.0
112 and 120	1Um both are clostest to zero	3.0
What do you think	I said closest to one	3.0
Explain how you knew that	Because 58ths is not well Its kinda close to a whole	4.0
Because 58ths is not well Its kinda close to a whole	And then a whole is	4.0
What is five eighths closest to though first of all	1A half	3.0
What did you think	1I said it was closest two	3.0
Okay	Because one in seven eigths is Almost two and then you have a sixth	4.0
And third Michael	One and a half	3.0
Im sorry what did you say it was closest to	One and a half	3.0
One and a half	He said one and a half	1.0
What do you think buddy	One   I thought that was closest to 2	3.0
And explain how	Well I already know that its over  uh and then 18th So Im kind of thinking itd be closest to two	4.0
Okay Evie	I think the next ones 2	3.0
Okay	Because three because the three	4.0
Three half	three is over two	4.0
three is over two	So theres already  and then if you add the 34th  one	4.0
So youre saying two	Yeah	0.0
And Haley explain the last one	Agree	1.0
Agree	Agree	1.0
Agree	I said one and one half because four thirds is already one whole and a little bit less than a half plus one tenth isnt that much	4.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
You are absolutely right it is	Is it snowing	0.0
Is it snowing	Yeah	0.0
Eric go back with Davis and Abbey	Ms Strathom can we just write down	0.0
Yeah so the three of you are going to compare and talk about your questions go	Okay	0.0
Okay	Who wants to go first	0.0
Be ready to share with your class there were only two	this problem what strategy should I use to do it what was the best way to get	0.0
So Eric what was one question someone in your group asked that you had not thought of	What kind of diagrams	3.0
What kind of diagrams excellent and what is something that you said	What operation	3.0
Zach what is something in your group that was talked about that you did not have	Austin said that you could use resources	1.0
And then what is something you said	I said that you could figure out what kind of math itd be  addition	3.0
Luke what is something your partner said that you did not	She said Ethan said to like organize or like organize the problems	1.0
Okay and what was something you said	I said you could use your resources  that can help you	3.0
What was something your group said that you did not	Um something my group said you could use like a diagram or whatever and I said you could use resources	1.0
And Rob what was something your group talked about	We talked about	0.0
If I dont understand that do I have resources that I can go grab	Yeah	0.0
And you guys I dont know if its going to give it to me or not but if not I will read it to you	Can we put our whiteboards away	0.0
Oh let me shrink that downOkay there you go	What I did first is I know you had to draw a picture so I drew four circles out of one plus one half equals one and one half and that again	4.0
What I did first is I know you had to draw a picture so I drew four circles out of one plus one half equals one and one half and that again	And then I knew that one and a half would equal one and then one plus one would equal two	4.0
And then I knew that one and a half would equal one and then one plus one would equal two	And then I did one plus 2 equals 3	4.0
Dan you should be up here t0o my friend	So what I did was I do a whole circle and a half circle close because its one one half	4.0
So what I did was I do a whole circle and a half circle close because its one one half	Then I took one one half  so I do one	4.0
Then I took one one half  so I do one	And then I got three equals cause one whole half plus half is a whole	4.0
Stay here Luke	This is one this is a half	3.0
This is one this is a half	And then I just have another one right here	3.0
And then I just have another one right here	And then	0.0
And then	And then since I have one half	3.0
Okay thank you	Um I add them together and I get one whole	4.0
Um I add them together and I get one whole	So I have two wholes	4.0
So I have two wholes	So um I have three wholes cause of like two halves	4.0
So um I have three wholes cause of like two halves	So its one half plus one and one half plus one and one half is 3 halves	4.0
AmyTell me w	Which one that might need some clar clar	0.0
clarification	is maybe Dans a little bit	1.0
Why	Because its kind of confusing cause  number one I cant see his  really	4.0
Because its kind of confusing cause  number one I cant see his  really	So make that more clear	4.0
So make that more clear	And also might need a little more understanding	4.0
Would that make a difference	Yeah	0.0
how many sand7wiches did I have		3.0
Not dividing yet just draw me the sandwiches	This is my affirmation too	0.0
and what was it	I was good in school today and I was doing good lessons	0.0
Okay what am I dividing those into	four fourths	3.0
Okay	windows	0.0
Okay so now each friend is going to get how much of each sandwhich	14th	3.0
14th What is it equal	one and a 14th	3.0
How many	one and a fourth	3.0
Why not	Because  13rd	4.0
Because  13rd	Its going to be 3 halves	4.0
Its going to be 3 halves	No no	0.0
No no	Im confused because	2.0
Tell me what you did	Okay so	0.0
in your own word tell me what you did	First I drew my picture	3.0
Okay	And then I split them up into equal amount of fractions	3.0
Which was what	one half and one third	3.0
And 13	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And I knew  that three times two is six	4.0
And I knew  that three times two is six	So then Yeah so then that one would already be way more than like a half	4.0
So then Yeah so then that one would already be way more than like a half	So you would have to add two more on to get equivalent fraction	4.0
so first I drew	I told you	0.0
circles half  13 I knew two times six equals three which told me I had how many eggs	One half and one third	3.0
Oh yeah	Yeah	0.0
You just didnt see the next part	You add two and then you add another two because  thatd be a half so then you have to add half and then  because you already have a half	4.0
And then Alyssa are you done honey	Yes	0.0
Theres four more on the back page	Together	0.0
First thing you have to do	Find a denominator	3.0
Is three the common denominator or is six the common denominator	Six	3.0
How do I get it to a six	Two	3.0
And then what do I have to do up here	Times	3.0
Two	Yeah two	3.0
And now what can I do	Two	3.0
is	Three	3.0
Yes love	So were confused on the last one because this one could be correct 26th	4.0
If I have 13	The weird thing is	0.0
thats 13 now I need one sixth	Ohhh	0.0
Make sense	No	0.0
No	Oh so  you are right you half	1.0
Oh so  you are right you half	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So	0.0
So	Oh	0.0
You have to divide them into fourths	Oh	0.0
But whats 54ths	One and one fourth	3.0
Um Luke you done	Yeah	0.0
I would like so Luke you said you were done	Yes	0.0
I would like you to meet with Austin please	No we	0.0
Oh you already met	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
So you did	Wouldnt it be minus	3.0
We will not been going outside for recess at time we will try to double check before lunch in regards to see if the weather has improved	Okay thank you	0.0
So you absolutely positively	I need one more question	0.0
Can I subtract	Uh the one or	3.0
Gage how many problems do you have done before I answer your question	I have three so I just need help with 4	0.0
Are you done	Yeah Im waiting for	0.0
So if I borrow one hole from this how many Am I borrowing from that	One plus two equals three	4.0
Four and whats four plus one	Five	3.0
Erase that for me	All of it	0.0
I need a partner for Rob who is done	Me and Zach are done with the back page	0.0
Dont move	Okay	0.0
Our friends need help over there Eli and Ethan can you go help them	Zachs helping us	0.0
Two forths or	one half	3.0
Does that make better sense	Yeah	0.0
So we did all this being able to put them in the value of the number place value chart and being able to read that	So this is the part we are skipping	0.0
Okay	That was quick	0.0
That was quick	Two seconds	0.0
But I mean weve got more to do	Well yeah but that was	0.0
And the reason its going to be messed up is	because we skipped	0.0
I think you need to write down the value of the underlined	Like in word form or just printed out	0.0
Word form and in value	Do I have to mark that	0.0
Word form and in value	Oh both of them	0.0
but its gotten further	zero point nine	3.0
09 because its	Tenths	3.0
You already wrote this	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Im sorry what	Hundredths	3.0
How many hundreds	3 hundredths	3.0
3 hundredths		3.0
Read this read this right here How did you write it	zero point zero three	3.0
Read the number	The two right	0.0
Ms Ava read the number for me	8 point 9 hundredths	3.0
Haley  What is the value in words	The value in words in 9 hundredths	3.0
And you got it correctly there so just what you wrote	Zero point zero nine	3.0
Okay	We didnt do the other one	0.0
How would you say that	zero point	3.0
How would I say that	34 hundreths	3.0
Yeah which is greater or 3400 or Mr JACK	248 thousandths	3.0
read it out loud for me	zero three four hundred	3.0
Hey Jeff how are you	Its if youre filling out a grid youre going to put three tents	4.0
Its if youre filling out a grid youre going to put three tents	And thats the whole line	4.0
And thats the whole line	And if youre filling out the grid for the 240 8000s you would only put two tenths	4.0
I dont think its going to let me How do I get	I think if you click the arrow thats on top of the pencil	0.0
I think if you click the arrow thats on top of the pencil	out there	0.0
Have we done this before	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yes	1.0
Im not going to get smaller am I	no	0.0
If I go left Im getting	smaller	3.0
Not 250  100 or 200Okay this is just telling you round up or down when the units are less than five round down when your units are higher than five round up	You cant do that	3.0
You said I cant we cant do that	I said we cant do the	0.0
Write down the number 917 and 203 thousandths	Wait what	0.0
I first have to make sure you wrote the number down correctly	Wait show it to you	0.0
So your number should be 917 point		3.0
Circle the digit in the hundreds place	Wait TOH	3.0
hundreths	What what are we supposed to do	2.0
THS	Can I go to the bathroom after Im done	0.0
Everybody should have circled by what	Zero	3.0
Its	Ms Strathom	0.0
Oh Why is it	Because	0.0
Because	Like hello Im right here	0.0
Where should your X have been	The 1	3.0
Solve problems 1 and 2	Wait what page	0.0
Wait what page	143 problems one and  two	0.0
143 problems one and  two	123 problems one and two	0.0
123 problems one and two	Do you want us to do the math lesson or	0.0
What	I  But you should only have done one and two not this one	0.0
I  But you should only have done one and two not this one	But you told us to do this I thought you meant this page and	0.0
What do my  denominators have to be	equal	3.0
So you were told to shade the grid to show what	Uh 2 uh	3.0
How do I say that	28 hundredths	3.0
So explain to me youre thinking up here	So what I did was I shaded these two columns	3.0
Alright because thats to what	Tenths	3.0
Okay	Then I shaded these eight hundredths and	3.0
Austin go ahead	So I put  So the question is is 28 hundredths closer to two tenths or three tenths	3.0
So I put  So the question is is 28 hundredths closer to two tenths or three tenths	Three tenths	3.0
Use the grid to help you decide	I put three tenths because eight is closer to um wait	4.0
it is closer to what	Um three	3.0
Zero or 10		3.0
Okay	And then I knew it was three tenths	3.0
Am I closer to three or am I closer to two	Ten	3.0
Ten	Three	1.0
Or am I closer to my 100 Point here		3.0
		1.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
How many		3.0
		1.0
My tallies were not very good	You didnt put	0.0
You didnt put	You could have split into four	3.0
Walk me through this	So if youre	0.0
Youre doing the first one right	Yes	0.0
Yes	If theres 619	3.0
619 what	Hundredths	3.0
Thank you	And you shade them six 12 times because theres six in the 10ths place	4.0
Okay	so then you Do one square because theres 1 hundredth and then do 9 of these little ones because theres 9 thousandths	4.0
When everyones done Im going to ask you to explain your thinking on 5 A	Okay	0.0
So what number is in my hundredths	One	3.0
So what would it be between	Zero and 2	3.0
Well those zero and two I think it wants you to do the between one and two	Okay	0.0
If I raise it to the nearest 100th whats it going to go up to	Yes	0.0
Yes	Two	3.0
So why wouldnt this have been	Um cause Yeah	0.0
Because its between one and	six	3.0
Okay between which 200 is so what is my number in the hundreds position	One	3.0
If I raise it whats it going to go to	Two	3.0
Okay so if I do that whats my number going to be between	2	3.0
And	3	3.0
What it is right there	again	0.0
As soon as I come over here	How	0.0
Am I gonna color nine of these or nine little ones	nine little ones	3.0
Mhm  just 10 of the little ones	Oh ok	0.0
If it tells me to raise this number to the nearest hundred what is my new number going to be	Two	3.0
What number is directly in between this	Two	3.0
Two		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
		1.0
So 15	3 point 615ths	3.0
3 point 615ths	Yeah and 615 thousand	1.0
Yeah and 615 thousand	Okay	0.0
Okay	All right	0.0
And then youre going to round this to the nearest hundreds	What would you like us to do when were done	0.0
I need to see the answer	Okay	0.0
You dont need to put the zero	Okay	0.0
You two are going to turn your desk	I need help on this	2.0
So what is your new number if you round it to the nearest hundred Whats your number going to be	200 I think	3.0
200 I think	No one because its not	0.0
Remember	Yeah	0.0
What is my new number going to be	I dont get this	2.0
I dont get this	3 and 62 hundreds	3.0
And you are starting	So Ill do odd numbers	0.0
So Ill do odd numbers	Okay so those its be more	0.0
One would be down here	So do you see how its closer because its past   One one two one three one four whats going to be directly in the middle	4.0
So do you see how its closer because its past   One one two one three one four whats going to be directly in the middle	And then if we got 36196 We rounded	4.0
And then if we got 36196 We rounded	Oh Yeah	1.0
Oh Yeah	It just happened again	0.0
It just happened again	What are the flashing lights	0.0
What are the flashing lights	Its the lights turned off and back on	0.0
Its the lights turned off and back on	Its the camera theyre taking pictures outside	0.0
Its the camera theyre taking pictures outside	Oh I thought it was lightening or something	0.0
Oh I thought it was lightening or something	You can do your number one	0.0
You can do your number one	I would like you to work with Izzy please	0.0
I would like you to work with Izzy please	So where would I start it at	2.0
So where would I start it at	3	3.0
3	or	0.0
3 point 6 9		0.0
Okay is that number five or more	Yes	0.0
So whats that one going to be called	Tens	3.0
So whats my new number	200	3.0
read it to me	3 and 6 hundreds	3.0
So if I know my number has to get to three and 62 hundreds	It would be two point	3.0
It would be two point	I know In between the middle and the three	3.0
In order for me to get	Okay	0.0
Which is for what number	One half	3.0
Whats half way	Half	0.0
Half		3.0
Okay how many of you are struggling on the number one	Nope	0.0
One five	It wouldnt round up	3.0
because my thumbs	K wait	0.0
K wait	4 point 25 4	3.0
4 point 25 4	Itd be a little bit past itd be a little bit past 400	3.0
Itd be a little bit past itd be a little bit past 400	so 425	3.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
So you all know what a coordinate grid is not new vocabulary but its the	Its the thing	0.0
Go gets your whiteboards and dry erase markers	I already got mine	0.0
I did not remember who that was but I threw	Oh on Friday	0.0
Oh on Friday	I forgot to take my book out of my desk	0.0
No there was a whole bunch of stuff that I threw in a cubby	Oh	0.0
I dont remember who it was	my desk	0.0
my desk	There was a bunch of stuff	0.0
Mr Owen would you please explain what you did	What I did was that greatest was 100	3.0
Least to greatest	The smallest was the	0.0
Do we agree for the least	Yes	1.0
Next	Next would be the 079	3.0
And greatest	1	3.0
Its least to greatest	Oh brother	0.0
Oh brother	is so hard for people	0.0
Okay	And then 067	3.0
Okay	And then 08	3.0
Explain to me how you did this Julia	I did it by knowing that the number in the tens place is either bigger or smaller	4.0
I did it by knowing that the number in the tens place is either bigger or smaller	And then the smallest number is the tens place for the two so that thats the smallest number	4.0
And then the smallest number is the tens place for the two so that thats the smallest number	And then the 67 was the second smallest number because theres a six	4.0
And then the 67 was the second smallest number because theres a six	And the greatest number which was eight	4.0
Zach would you like to add to that	Couldnt you just take away the decimal and look at it as a normal number and see which is big	4.0
Couldnt you just take away the decimal and look at it as a normal number and see which is big	No because all of them are zero	4.0
You could also do that as well	You could also just	0.0
We are not talking	Because sometimes I cant hear you so I dont know	0.0
Im sorry what	I cant really hear you well	0.0
Oh	Hes asking questions	0.0
Hes asking questions	I dont know	2.0
Whats the least number of blocks	I only got two blocks	3.0
I only got two blocks	He goes from the school	0.0
How many do you think is the fewest	I think it is six and five	3.0
Whats six plus five	11	3.0
Okay	This is a stupid question I should have known this	0.0
So tell us what you did first	What I did I went to how far the grocery store	3.0
So tell me the route that you took him	I did	0.0
So you started at the school	Yes I started	0.0
What did you do	I went across like that	3.0
So you went from the school to number six correct	Yes	0.0
Is that a route to the school	Yes	0.0
So Blake Im going to ask you to please give me a route	You go diagonal	3.0
Can I go diagonal	So I went from the school and then to the	3.0
So I went from the school and then to the	But then you go through a block	3.0
Over the one	Yeah	0.0
Is that how you did it	Yes thats how I did it	0.0
Yes thats how I did it	Youre walking like through a building	1.0
So what do you think Zach	I started at zero and then went up to five and then across	4.0
I started at zero and then went up to five and then across	Thats ten	4.0
Thats ten	Yeah thats what I did	0.0
You started at zero	I got ten too but now Im just getting 11	3.0
I got ten too but now Im just getting 11	So	0.0
Okay	And then I went up to five	3.0
So one two three four five	Yeah	0.0
Six seven eight nine 10 11	I know how Im getting ten	0.0
Whatd you do that Julian that you got 10	I wen over to five and then since when were doing our Xaxis or whatever we have the dot right there	4.0
Five	Yeah but	0.0
Were not estimating	Yesterday when we did the dot we put it in the middle and then put the name here in a square	3.0
Makes sense	I saw hat	0.0
Im sorry	Thank you	0.0
See I told you I felt like I was gone for a month	Wait Ms doesnt everyone carry the	0.0
Find the fewest number of blocks between other locations on the map	Which is the	0.0
Give me your coordinates for both	Wait coordinates What	2.0
Wait coordinates What	Wait	0.0
Wait	Where are we going from to start	2.0
And I need you to write the coordinate numbers	What coordinate the pizzeria is at	0.0
Please do not use your dry erase markers in your map book	so were doing	0.0
Thank you	Thank you	0.0
First of all what is the coordinates to the park entrance	Two and ten	3.0
What is the least amount of blocks to get there	Nine	3.0
So tell me how you got nine buddy	I went from the pizzeria and then went all the way out	0.0
What were your coordinates	10 and eight	3.0
So now tell me what you did from there	I went from the pizzeria all the way over until the park entrance which is right above	3.0
Went over and then up	Yes	0.0
So you went from	I started at the pizzeria	3.0
How many blocks did you think it was babe	Nine	3.0
Is it 10	Yes	0.0
What are the coordinates I am looking for where did we start	Okay	0.0
Okay	So you started from the library area and go to the ice cream	3.0
So what are the coordinates of the library	One and three	3.0
And where did we have to go	To the ice cream shop	3.0
And what are the coordinates of the ice cream shop	14 12	3.0
Tell me what we did buddy	So what I did was I went straight from the right	3.0
So what I did was I went straight from the right	And I kept going until I got to the coordinate 14	3.0
Okay	Thats 13	3.0
Go ahead	And then I went up to 12	3.0
Did we get 22	Yes	0.0
Youre all disagreeing but Im going to have to tell you youre wrong	No we got 23	3.0
Oh you agree	Were all agreeing	1.0
You got what	23	3.0
23	I miscounted	3.0
When we went this way why cant we go that way	Because wed be walking through buildings	4.0
Can I	walking through the wall	3.0
So its vitally important that you make sure and you always go what coordinate first	X	3.0
And then	Y	3.0
Yes sir	Wouldnt it be the same distance every single way	3.0
I did I made a perfect square didnt I	Yeah	0.0
What is the fewest number of blocks you would walk from school to the pool	School pool	0.0
School to the pool	The pool entrance	0.0
Um	The school entrance	0.0
You ready to talk to me	Yes	0.0
Mr Julian what are my coordinates first for the school	Zero zero	3.0
And to the pool	that is two 12	3.0
How many blocks	I said 16	3.0
Ooh	Because you cant cross above the entrance	4.0
Because you cant cross above the entrance	But you werent	1.0
But why couldnt you have just gone	Yeah	0.0
Do you see what I did	Yes	0.0
So how many is it	14	3.0
Yes	I got the answer but I got it in a different way	1.0
I got the answer but I got it in a different way	I didnt look through the last one	4.0
I didnt look through the last one	What I did is I added the coordinates together and I did 12 plus two	4.0
What I did is I added the coordinates together and I did 12 plus two	And thats when I think youre making	0.0
Does it work every time	No	0.0
Okay	Ive kind of been looking at it and trying to figure out	0.0
Trying to figure out if it does	Try six and five	4.0
Try six and five	And that would be 11	4.0
And that would be 11	Yeah	0.0
I keep kicking that Im so sorry	I think it takes	0.0
When its not going to work is when I start here and over	Yeah	0.0
So lets see you	How I want it is that	0.0
One two three	Seven 14	3.0
And when you got it raise your hand	Nine blocks away right	0.0
Tell me another place he could be	Park	3.0
Another place we could be	The pizzeria	3.0
Where could it be Amy	Did he say the ice cream shop	3.0
Theres one more	The post office	3.0
The post office	I did the ice cream	3.0
And were to see	Wait so whats our focus today	0.0
Lets see if this is going to let me play it	That game	0.0
I dont know if we can play this game friends	Oh I see it	0.0
Oh I see it	Its hidden treasure	0.0
Its hidden treasure	I see it	0.0
I see it	Down at the bottom	0.0
Yay	Yay	0.0
So Im going to say four seven	Wait do you just guess	0.0
So	Sorry	0.0
One two three	No you cant do it that way	0.0
No you cant do it that way	No you have to go up maybe	0.0
Four	Maybe down	0.0
Maybe down	Try	0.0
Is it eight away there	Yeah	0.0
Okay so you see how youre going to play this	Yes	0.0
Explain it	You have to get to the coordinate and then it tells you how much distance youre far away from the treasure	3.0
So then what am I doing each time	Youre trying to get closer to the treasure	3.0
Changing what	The coordinates	3.0
Maam	Do we go from zero	3.0
Youve got to guess	So its just a guessing game sort of	0.0
So if I	The first one is a guess and then youve got to figure out	0.0
From now I know what I was doing was better	I was three off at my first guess	3.0
So you think eight seven	I got the treasure	0.0
Of course	Find the treasure	0.0
Okay	No you didnt	0.0
No you didnt	Yes I did	0.0
Yes I did	Calm down bro	0.0
Okay	I got it like seconds ago	0.0
So our learning intention for foureight is I can represent mathematical problems on a coordinate grid by plotting points to form pictures	Yes	0.0
I love that you all went Yes	I	0.0
Yes maam	So I was talking to my mom about coordinates and how I love them so much and she said that they did this	0.0
So I was talking to my mom about coordinates and how I love them so much and she said that they did this	I asked her to bring me home some because I love coordinates so much	0.0
You really can	She made a star	3.0
So	Wait what	0.0
Make it smaller	Make it smaller	0.0
Get out your	Whiteboards	0.0
You know I have to tell you that I enjoyed our snow day yesterday	Same	0.0
I dont know why	I had to shovel all of my friends driveways	0.0
I wasnt here Monday and I was okay to justify that because you had the amazing Mrs Hunter	Woo woo	0.0
That is the weirdest thing	Excuse me Adam	0.0
So a half one and a half	And a zero	3.0
So zero a half one and a half	Well one	3.0
Or one one and a half two okay	Okay	0.0
Please stand up and cover your nose	Bless you	0.0
Okay where did it go	Its buried	0.0
Its buried and I because I didnt take it home with me didnt	Oh okay	0.0
Yes	Well maybe later	0.0
Fingers up I mean	Wait so whats the half one again	0.0
Half is just the five fingers	Okay	0.0
No one knows whats right or wrong yet so explain to me why you said a half	Mrs	0.0
Hi	I want to see why they think its a half	2.0
So why did you say that was a half	Because I thought it was closest	4.0
Was that closer to a half or a whole	Bless you	0.0
And then fivesixths is that closer to a half or a whole	A whole	3.0
Is that what your answer was or was it just a half	A half	3.0
Zach would you please	Suggesting why is a half	0.0
Suggesting why is a half	I had zero	3.0
How can we help his understanding change	Seveneighths is closer to one than it is half and fivesixths is closer to one than it is half then its pretty much one minus one	4.0
Does that make sense	Yep	0.0
Yeah we	Yeah	0.0
Okay so I would like for Julia explain your reasoning behind this to me please	I think it would be because theres already a one and so threeeighths is close to a half and twothirds is also close to a half so a half plus a half would be a whole	4.0
What do you think	Since they both have the same denominator if you subtract threefourths from onefourth that gets you two well	4.0
Twofourths	Yeah and then the twofourths to the one you need to minus that	4.0
Yeah and then the twofourths to the one you need to minus that	And then what I would do is I would take the two and turn it into eighths so I make it more easy and minus the twofourths probably eight which would get sixfourths	4.0
Oh so you would turn it into eightfourths minus threefourths	Yeah	0.0
Why is it ninefourths	Because theres a one	4.0
So whats ninefourths minus three fourths	Sixfourths	3.0
Okay and you said originally what did you say your benchmark was	One and a half	3.0
Nice job my loves	Good job	0.0
Okay	T can I ask a quick question	0.0
T can I ask a quick question	Are we going to share the Bill of Rights or should I put it away	0.0
Oh you can put it away for right now	Okay	0.0
Put your finger	135	0.0
I want on 134 I want you to look at the coordinating points	That says graph and sailboats	0.0
Coordinating points	Oh right here	0.0
You are in for a treat today	Woo hoo	0.0
Because I can tell you that I have had two of those today	Oh wow	0.0
Okay	Can I have some coffee	0.0
So what I do when I do this is eightone fiveone and I use my straight edge	Rulers	0.0
I love that John just turned his chair around	Thats hilarious	0.0
Thats hilarious	Johns a brain	0.0
Johns a brain	Yeah I think so	0.0
Yeah I think so	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	Zero one	3.0
Zero one	T	0.0
T	It says fiveone twice	0.0
If you dont do what its telling you to do Matt its not going to come out	The rulers dont fit	0.0
Oh I see what I did wrong	I did it wrong but I did it	3.0
Onetwo  All right	Woo its actually cool	0.0
Woo its actually cool	Do you want us to do the new sailboat	0.0
No	Okay	0.0
Youre supposed to stand when you are done	Okay	0.0
Okay	Its 16	0.0
Its 16	Its 162	0.0
If you have a microphone on your desk would you please bring it with you	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah I do	0.0
Yeah I do	We dont have microphones	0.0
We dont have microphones	No thats not my mouse	0.0
No thats not my mouse	Microsoft mouse	0.0
Okay stand in front of someone thats in the circle	Should I stand in the circle T	0.0
Then you do fiveseven not	So right there	0.0
Yeah	T I got up while you were talking to her	0.0
T I got up while you were talking to her	Should I go in front of someone or stay here	0.0
Go in front of someone	Okay	0.0
Zach just join a SS	You can join with us Zach	0.0
Go	Lets see	0.0
Lets see	My sailboat looks the exact same as your sailboat	1.0
Yeah then you would connect it to giveone	Yeah my sailboat looks like her sailboat	1.0
Yeah my sailboat looks like her sailboat	It looks like you didnt connect it	1.0
Like that okay	Great job Madeline	1.0
Great job Madeline	Yes I think we have it done	0.0
Okay once you and your partner have shared go to a zero	Including my partner	0.0
Everyone else go back to your seats	Including my partner	0.0
Okay so	Wait how did you go  Quarter okay so heres what	0.0
So eight times two is	16	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
Seven times two is	14	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Two times one is	Four	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Please continue that down	What would be zero	2.0
What would be zero	Zero times two is zero	4.0
Zero times two is zero	Yeah because anything times zero is zero	4.0
I did five times two is 10	No	0.0
I said please continue to do that one	Nobody ever asked me about it	0.0
Fill in the blanks	Times two	0.0
Times two	And then	0.0
Preferably a colored pencil or	Can you use pens	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay when you are done doing that put your hands on your head	I have my hand on my head	0.0
What	Its only times two	3.0
Thats what I said	You can just add	3.0
You can just add	Yeah you can just add	1.0
You are writing the answer over it in colored pencil	Got it	0.0
All right everybody zero times two	Zero	3.0
One times two	Two	3.0
Two times two	Four	3.0
Zero times two	Zero	3.0
Seven times two	14	3.0
Zero times two	Zero	3.0
Eight times two	16	3.0
One times two	Two	3.0
You are going to graph them on the new sailboat	With our pencil or	0.0
So now youre going to do the same thing	And do we list 16 too or just the ones we wrote	0.0
And do we list 16 too or just the ones we wrote	Or we list all of them	0.0
Or we list all of them	You list all of them	0.0
You needed to list all of these	Okay okay	0.0
Okay okay	Yeah	0.0
What is your strategy that youre using here Anna	Check marks	3.0
Why are you using a check mark	To see which ones Ive done	3.0
Bless you	Thank you	0.0
What have we got going there	Its not straight	3.0
Its not straight	Its just I did it straight at first now its that way	3.0
So I would like you to connect because this has to be connected here in order for this to be correct right	Right	0.0
Its got to look like the one you did before so that tells you you missed something if it does not look like it did before	Oh	0.0
Oh	Oh shoot	0.0
Okay those of you that are done what are you going to do with sailboat number two	Youre going to double the first coordinate and then leave the second one the same	3.0
Sorry	Can we check it with a partner	0.0
What are you confused with	The zerothree	2.0
Wheres the two now	Its right here	3.0
Theres your two so it would be right here	Right here	0.0
Yeah zerotwo	Okay	0.0
The first thing you said am I right	Yeah but	0.0
Okay so the first thing we need to do is erase everything	Gotcha	0.0
Okay	If I cant even do this I cant do	0.0
What is the first number	16two	3.0
Okay	Wait are we timesing it by two again	3.0
Now wheres 10two	Alyssa so were times	3.0
Now youre going to connect those two	X but Y needs the same	3.0
X but Y needs the same	Yeah were taking one away	1.0
You already doubled it here so if youve got to make sure that you doubled	Oh its just half of the second number	3.0
Oh its just half of the second number	Its just half of the second number because I looked at the first	3.0
They should be the exact same as these	And then its half of the second number	3.0
So this would be 10one 10seven twotwo 10one	Oh I was doing it as like 16two whats half of two	4.0
Oh I was doing it as like 16two whats half of two	Thats one and then	4.0
What are you struggling with my friend	I just dont get this	2.0
Eight times two is	16	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
Seven times two is	14	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Two times two is	Four	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
Zero times zero	Zero	3.0
One times two	Two	3.0
Two times two	Four	3.0
Zero times two	Zero	3.0
Seven times two	14	3.0
Zero times zero	Zero	3.0
Eight times two	16	3.0
One times two	Two	3.0
Then your next one	I made a sailboat too	0.0
So now you need to draw a line this over to there okay	Im confused because	2.0
I go horizontal first	Oh its 16	3.0
And then I go vertical second	I didnt see that at the bottom here	0.0
So horizontal vertical okay	Okay	0.0
Now connect that one	And then you have to do the second and then you can do that	0.0
So eight times two is	16	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
Five times two is	10	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
So write two and what do we do with this	Write two	3.0
Five times one is or five times two is	10	3.0
Zero times two is	Zero	3.0
Two times two is	Four	3.0
Seven times two is	14	3.0
Eight times two is	16	3.0
Eight times two is	16	3.0
That help	Yeah	0.0
All right how we doing	Im done	0.0
Did you compare them	Yes	0.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
One times two is	Two	3.0
When you are done compare it	Seven	3.0
If I give you the numbers you should be able to do this	Where did I get the seven	2.0
So lets try and dont get frustrated	Oh yeah	0.0
Oh yeah	10seven right there	3.0
Okay so remember when we coordinate this is  May I borrow your pencil	Theres no 1010 anywhere	3.0
My X is after Ive done that so where would fiveseven be do you think	One second	0.0
Now show me where onetwo is	Eighttwo and then fivetwo	3.0
Whats your next one	Zerotwo	3.0
Put an X there	What do you mean Adam	1.0
When youve got it check your numbers with your friends	Im confused	2.0
And	T	0.0
Whats your first number here	16one	3.0
Okay so those need to connect	Wow thats a very tall sail	0.0
The original sailboat looking at sailboat one is what	Bigger	3.0
How much bigger	Double	3.0
Okay so we made a little bit of an error here okay	She said when you and your partner are done raise your hand and shes going to come by	0.0
16two is right there right	Yeah	0.0
Okay you guys are all done right	Yes	0.0
Are you ready	Yeah	0.0
You are going to triple the first number of the ordered pairs	Make sure your coordinates are right	1.0
Make sure your coordinates are right	They might be wrong	1.0
So I would circle that	And then leave the second one	3.0
Thats what your new sailboat four will be	Okay	0.0
So you are doing the triple answering these questions and then down here youre going to triple the first number which would be eight times	Three	3.0
Oh what did we do	I dont know because	2.0
You just didnt	Oh	0.0
Well theres where your problem is because its not long enough	I dont like that sailboat	0.0
I dont like that sailboat	Its weird	0.0
Thats why you need to use the tools	Its tiny	0.0
You guys did yours together right	We discussed it too	0.0
Have you checked all your work together	No just us two	0.0
I would check your work together	Want to work together	0.0
Check your work together	We did	0.0
Check your work and you guys are all checked	Just us two	0.0
Make sure its the same	T	0.0
Okay now you guys are going to double the first number of the ordered pair	Together	0.0
Turn the page and youre doing that one	Triple the second number	3.0
No double	Oh double the first number	4.0
Oh double the first number	Then you halve the second number	4.0
Then you halve the second number	Do you want us to work together	0.0
Okay	So you triple the first one and then you split the second one in half	4.0
Elliot you have got to stop ripping your paper	I didnt mean to do that	0.0
Youre doing that one right there	Oh so	0.0
Why are we worried about numbers Adam when we should be working on math	T	0.0
What does this tell you to do	Double the first number	3.0
And of the original pair what does it tell you to do with the second number	Leave it alone	0.0
Im doubling the first number and then leaving the second one the same	Wait what about seven though	2.0
Wait what about seven though	Thats	0.0
Thats	I know	0.0
I know	I dont know how to do seven	2.0
I dont know how to do seven	I thought of zero	3.0
I thought of zero	I dont know how to halve even	2.0
I dont know how to halve even	You just split it into half and have like four and a half or something	4.0
Why cant you do four and a half	Because where does the half go	2.0
Because where does the half go	Yeah in between	1.0
It would be between the squares	Wait so this would be halves not zero	3.0
Wait so this would be halves not zero	This would be a half not zero	3.0
Triple the first number of the ordered pair	This says double	0.0
So	Were doubling this number	3.0
So what is double the first number	16	3.0
And what is half of one	A half	3.0
So if its 16 and a half	It would go right there	3.0
It would be right there	Thats so weird	0.0
I know	So half is in between the thing	3.0
This is zero one two three one	Oh see  Oh	0.0
One two	Okay I see where you put that	0.0
Three	Oh thats weird	0.0
If my coordinate is three and two and a half thats where it would be	Okay that	0.0
Does that make sense	Yeah	0.0
So in between zero and one theres a half	And then	0.0
In between one and two theres a half	Double zero would be a half right	3.0
Double zero would be a half right	Or would that be a whole	3.0
Or would that be a whole	Wait so first	0.0
If I double zero	Oh thats just still going to be zero	3.0
Zero and I attach a zero	Its going to be zero	3.0
All right	But T	0.0
Yes	So this one right here would be 10 and three one halves	4.0
So this one right here would be 10 and three one halves	Because you double five thats 10 and then three one halves so its half	4.0
Make sense	Yeah I dont like that	0.0
But your brain is so smart it knows how to do it	It just doesnt like it	0.0
Eight times	This is so weird	0.0
This is so weird	16 and a half	3.0
16 and a half	Wait whats	0.0
Wait whats	Wait so  Never mind	0.0
And 24 and	One	3.0
Whats two plus two	Two plus two is four but	3.0
If I need one more to get to five and I need to cut that in half whats half of one	Wait what would be half of zero	2.0
Wait what would be half of zero	Negative one half	3.0
Two and a half	Yeah but technically half of zero would go into the negatives so it would be negative one half	4.0
Yeah but technically half of zero would go into the negatives so it would be negative one half	Do you do two smaller than five so that we stay the same	4.0
No youre just cutting five in half	Six one halves	3.0
If I do five divided by two it goes into that once with one left one and a half	No but	0.0
Or it goes in two times because thats four	But	0.0
But	How would you do two on this side	2.0
Why would you do three	But thats my question	0.0
I know that two plus two is four and that half of four is two	How wimpy is this sail	0.0
And were going to do	Zero one half what	2.0
Okay so one	Then fourzero	3.0
Then fourzero	This is confusing	2.0
A four	14zero	3.0
A half two and then extend this out	16 is a half if Im right	3.0
So now I have to label them onefour	What the heck is this boat	0.0
So if I run that all the way out to five okay	Are you done	0.0
Five four so three four	But Matt but Matt T assigned each person to something different	0.0
Four a four a half	Uhhuh  she assigned some people something else so Id ask her which one she wants you to do	0.0
One two and	A half	3.0
So half of seven whats closest to  Three plus three is	Three plus three is six	4.0
So if I did not	You made the go all the way to one and a half	3.0
Whats closest to nine thats a whole number	I made it go to twoone then twoone	3.0
Okay whats half of 10	Five	3.0
So whats a half less than five	Okay there you go	0.0
Whats between four and five	You need to make the line right here	3.0
Okay so whats four and a half plus four and a half	Nine	3.0
What do I get	11	3.0
Are you done	Yeah	0.0
All of you agreed on the ones that tripled it	Mmhmm	1.0
Circle that and thats what youre doing to answer all those	Tell me more about our homework	2.0
You need to be working	Ill move that space	0.0
Elliot lets get going	Im not sure	0.0
I would like you to do the triple okay	Can I go to the bathroom	0.0
Go show those friends yours and then come back and start on your math boxes or your homework	What friends	0.0
Those friends	There Im done	0.0
Howd we do buddy	Good	0.0
I can tell you you needed to connect here to here	Oh thats okay	0.0
So what does that mean Im multiplying everything by	Three	3.0
So what would this first one be	24	3.0
When youve got those done call me over	Okay	0.0
Okay	So we do math boxes and our homework by ourselves right	0.0
Go look at theirs so you can see the difference in them	We checked with them	0.0
Home link for 48	By yourself right	0.0
When you take the time to email me I take the time to	Not make you do it at recess	0.0
I didnt do lunch count	Or the pledge	0.0
Well do the announcements later	No	0.0
No	And the pledge	0.0
Four five six seven eight nine 10 16	16	0.0
Talk about unorganized this morning	Yes maam	0.0
Okay so my lab today is part of our	Its wrong	0.0
Its wrong	Oh no	0.0
Yeah so this is the role of the constructed response that we were working on and I need you to	Get our white boards	0.0
Yeah get your white boards out	Im so smart	0.0
What does enlarge mean everybody	Big	3.0
Ally is my only one missing correct	Yes	0.0
Thank you	I have a red one	0.0
I have a red one	This came to mine	0.0
Okay so throughout the lesson today your diagrams whatever youre making on those grids should be getting what	Larger	3.0
Bigger	Bigger	0.0
Everyone close your eyes	I dont have a white board	0.0
Close your eyes	Just put your mask over your eyes	0.0
Okay so youre looking at this thinking about	Open your eyes	0.0
What does the word greater than mean everybody	Its greater	0.0
Its greater	Like more	3.0
So you are going to go yes or no or is it true or both what you work with	Its T and F	0.0
Its yes or no	Isnt it	0.0
Minus 60	T	0.0
Yes	No	0.0
No	So you arent writing yes or no if its bigger than 45	0.0
on my stuff	Its okay	0.0
Lets go	No	0.0
Lets go	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Its not that hard	0.0
Today we are going to conduct a fire drill	What	0.0
I am just putting my sunglasses on	Ive been wearing my coat	0.0
What	Are we still going to get our recess since we	0.0
Greater than is the expression greater than 45 times nine	No	0.0
Do I need to know what 45 times nine is at all	No	0.0
If I am minusing 50 from the answer is it going to be greater than or less than	Less than	3.0
If I am adding to it is it going to be greater than or less than	Greater than	3.0
If I am multiplying it is it going to be greater than or less than	Greater than	3.0
Do you understand why I asked if you needed to know exactly what 45 times nine was	Yeah	0.0
If I am subtracting 125 from it is my expression going to be less than or more than	Less than	3.0
If Im subtracting 798 plus 212 from 798 plus 212 what is my answer going to be	Less	3.0
If Im dividing it is it going to be more than or less than	Less than	3.0
So all of these would be	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Yes	Theyre all yes	1.0
Have a seat	Thats annoying	0.0
Adam whats annoying	Matt	0.0
Matt	Sorry	0.0
141 and 142	We have 10 more pages and were done because it stops at 151	0.0
You are going to complete	141 and 42	0.0
Go	All of it or just	0.0
Wheres your Math Journal Skyler	I	0.0
So you stand when youre done	Do you want us to do both pages	0.0
I cannot hear a word you say	it would be bigger because you double it so it would be bigger	4.0
Whats it going to look like	It made it bigger	3.0
You are right but all the way around	No	0.0
No	Its going to get bigger and narrower	3.0
Okay	Im right here	0.0
Youve finished that whole page	Mmhmm	0.0
Check your work	Both pages	0.0
Both pages	Yes	0.0
Go meet with Austin	Okay	0.0
Yeah after	Yes	0.0
Yes	It does	0.0
It does	Thank you for being my partner	0.0
Oh okay	Oh okay	0.0
Jason yeah can I bother you to prep your answer with Katie please	I got zero zero	3.0
I got zero zero	Do we work it	0.0
Youre welcome	Thank you	0.0

Oh Im going to wait for you to be done	All right	0.0
All right	Thank you	0.0
Thank you	I got it	0.0
What does a trapezoid have	Four sides	3.0
Sarahs rule was double the first coordinate at that point so I am going to ask	To	0.0
Matt to stand up please	Yes	0.0
Be specific	Can I just say what I wrote	0.0
Yep tell us what you wrote buddy	I said If Sarah uses her rule I think she will get what she wants it because she wants it to be longer	4.0
I said If Sarah uses her rule I think she will get what she wants it because she wants it to be longer	This is because if she doubles her first coordinate she will be doubling the X coordinate which is the length of the trapezoid	4.0
This is because if she doubles her first coordinate she will be doubling the X coordinate which is the length of the trapezoid	This should be widerlonger	4.0
Jonathan do you agree or disagree	I agree with him	1.0
Why	Because he says it would be doubled at X coordinate which	4.0
So by doubling the X coordinate my trapezoid is getting	Wider	3.0
If I double the Y coordinate my trapezoid is getting	Taller	3.0
She is wanting to make it	Wider	3.0
Please dont do that Kenneth	Okay	0.0
All right so drag the red quadrangle to what you think it will look like then press the next button	That was the next one	0.0
So if I am doubling I start at zero because if I double zero I have what	Zero	3.0
If I double one I have	Two	3.0
If I double five I have	10	3.0
If I double five I have	10	3.0
If I double zero I have	Zero	3.0
Did I do what I needed to do	No	0.0
What did I not do Maddy	You just doubled	3.0
You just doubled	You didnt put the other coordinates in	3.0
You didnt put the other coordinates in	You just did the first one	3.0
Oh so I need both of them in order to make this work	Yeah	0.0
If I have two	Four	3.0
If I double one I go to	Two	3.0
Two	To four	1.0
Two	that one	0.0
Oops two	No	0.0
No	I think it needs to be up top	0.0
I think it needs to be up top	No because	0.0
No because	And then	0.0
And then	Oh you have to move the	0.0
Oh you have to move the	Yeah	0.0
Oh I have to move that to four or to two right	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Than I have 10  so I can move that over	It has to be	0.0
It has to be	It has to be by 10	3.0
Is that better	Yes	0.0
Okay	I wasnt expecting it to that	0.0
What is her first coordinate	Zero zero	3.0
Okay so I have Maddy and I have Logan	Now you have me	0.0
Now Michael what are the next coordinates going to be	Two and four	3.0
Two and four okay	It didnt put the four	0.0
All right Mr Michael this ones yours	Isnt that what we just finished	0.0
Isnt that what we just finished	It is	0.0
And then Haley whats the next one buddy	The next one is 10 four	3.0
Nick whats the next one	10 zero	3.0
And then what is the very last one Austin	Zero zero	3.0
Do we all agree with these	Yes	1.0
Yes	It even drew it for us	0.0
Okay so we got that one	What	0.0
What	Wait	0.0
Why or why not	I said trapezoid  it wont	0.0
I said trapezoid  it wont	The trapezoid wont measure  and then just got wider	0.0
Add to what do you think we should add to it Anna	Why it works because the X coordinate made it wider and wouldnt make it if you wasnt doubling the Y coordinate	4.0
All right so do you have a better understanding of what an explanation should look like	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	0.0
If you say a four I want you to use the information that I gave you when we discussed and I read what they wrote as a	Thank you	0.0
Make sense	Mmhmm	0.0
Because you are what	The best of the best	0.0
The best of the best	5th graders	0.0
Did they have you do math	Yeah math writing	0.0
Yeah math writing	I	0.0
I	Okay	0.0
Okay	I need you write my name	0.0
Were you nervous	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Are you ready	0.0
Do you guys mind if Michael joins you	Sure	0.0
Thank you	So we have a little thingy	0.0
Okay	Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	0.0
Jake is designing a picture for the cover of his reading folder	He draws a picture	0.0
Do you understand coordinate grids at all	of a book on the coordinate grid	0.0
of a book on the coordinate grid	After drawing	0.0
And if you do not its okay because sometimes I dont understand them	a picture of a larger book on the cover	0.0
a picture of a larger book on the cover	How much larger	0.0
Okay so	Thats what I was	0.0
Okay	Right	0.0
So you see how I got my five one	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Describe what you think will	0.0
Okay so Im going to go to	I think we should say	0.0
I think we should say	I think we should say the book will double in size on the X coordinate and double in size on the Y coordinate	3.0
Itll be up yeah	Make sure	0.0
So now we got a nine and we got a five	It will double	3.0
So show me how you would take it from nine to the five	in size because we are	3.0
Mark it right	doubling	3.0
Good job	Now X	3.0
Now show me 11 seven	I totally just forgot my sentence	0.0
I totally just forgot my sentence	And Y coordinates and Im going to put a common linking the bars	3.0
All right so we have Oh  so its got to be right there	Just so this will make	0.0
Put it in there	Zero two zero 10	3.0
It needs to come right there	a two two	3.0
One more	and four eight zero	3.0
Yep right there in that corner	and four eight	3.0

Yeah	Thats correct	1.0
Thats correct	Thats what I put	1.0
Thats what I put	I know eight nines is almost a whole	1.0
I know eight nines is almost a whole	If you add anything to it it will be greater than a whole	4.0
If you add anything to it it will be greater than a whole	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	And then for that one its like what you can make	1.0
And then for that one its like what you can make	Is that all	1.0

Yeah	Lets go to lesson 17	0.0
How did you match up	So work on the before while I finish this page	0.0
So work on the before while I finish this page	Both X and Y	3.0
Both X and Y	So its going to double that	1.0
So its going to double that	Right	1.0
Right	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	That X right there	1.0
That X right there	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	So its going to	0.0
What should it be	Four zero	3.0
Then we have eight two eight 10 six 10 four	The difference	3.0
What would that one be	Like 16	3.0
Like 16	Four eight	1.0
My second one is zero two	Okay nine zero	3.0
My next one is up there	Oh I did mine	0.0
Youve got to make sure you do the X coordinate first	Eight divided by Y	3.0
You have to staple these	The next one two 10	3.0
The next one two 10	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Im almost done	0.0
I would like you to work on some math class because you are not doing homework until tomorrow night	What	0.0
Okay	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	Put zero 10	3.0
I should see SSs finishing and bringing me their rubric and their paper	Im finished	0.0
Im finished	Okay	0.0
Okay	What did you get for the first one	2.0
What did you get for the first one	I said 30 and three	3.0
I said 30 and three	15	1.0
15	Add volume	1.0
Add volume	seven plus 24	1.0
seven plus 24	Oh seven times 24	1.0
Oh seven times 24	That sounds big	1.0
That sounds big	90 plus eight	1.0
90 plus eight	Oh yeah	1.0
Oh yeah	10 yeah	1.0
10 yeah	Okay	0.0
Okay	Yeah and then I have like eight divided by two	1.0
Yeah and then I have like eight divided by two	And then we have	0.0
And then we have	Wait	0.0
Wait	I took mine and said this how much you can fit into	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Yes	1.0
Yes	I do	1.0
I do	Okay one more	0.0
Where else	If youre writing a business paper you probably have to revise that	0.0
Exactly	Like in our writing	0.0
So lets get in here	Are we looking at someones from this class	0.0
Are we looking at someones from this class	Or someones from a different class	0.0
No Im going to use strictly everything thats on the	Oh	0.0
Write on your whiteboard what he needed to do with those grids	Wait so	0.0
When youve got an answer please stand up	Did you grade them	0.0
What did you guys write on your paper	Didnt he have to double the X and Y coordinate	3.0
Haley what did you guys talk about	We talked about you have to extend your coordinates	3.0
So the question I asked is Jake decides he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder	question	0.0
Should my answer have been a rule or should it have been using the words bigger larger	Bigger	3.0
Bigger	Larger	3.0
If I write a rule what does that rule need to contain	How much youre making it bigger	3.0
What kind of words would I use	Coordinates	3.0
What am I going to do with those coordinates	Make them bigger	3.0
If youre not sure of what word Im looking for phone a friend	Eli	0.0
Eli	Jake would have to do whatever triple double whatever to match the	3.0
Okay	the X coordinate or the Y coordinate or both	3.0
Or do I need to double both parts of it	You need to double the X and the Y	3.0
Wheres my page 397	What page 397	0.0
What page 397	It was the answer key	0.0
Why is it not letting me see the kids work	Because theres a thing that says S view	0.0
Let me get back to that first one	Oh it says S work in there	0.0
Oh it says S work in there	In the other one it said Ss work	0.0
Thats enlarging the	No not in that one	0.0
No not in that one	It was the one above that one that said Ss work	0.0
It was the one above that one that said Ss work	That one	0.0
I know you listen to mine ring a million times	Just turned it	0.0
Here we go	Thats training	0.0
But I dont understand	Thats almost the size we did ours	0.0
Did he explain what he did to the coordinates	Yes	0.0
Did he explain how the book was going to change	No	0.0
No	Yes	0.0
Do your rules sound like that one	Yes	0.0
Tell me what yours says	Which one is that	0.0
The rest of the class is listening	I said A rule that Jake can use to make his picture bigger than it is	4.0
I said A rule that Jake can use to make his picture bigger than it is	Then Matt said quadruple it so we did times four	4.0
But did you tell me how it was going to increase the units	No	0.0
So is your answer similar to his or not	No	1.0
What do you think Matt	Not	1.0
Taller or	What about bigger	3.0
What about bigger	Yeah what about bigger	1.0
What did you write Ryan what did you write	I wrote Our prediction was	0.0
What did you write for number two on the front	That it will look taller and wider	3.0
If he changed it by six what should it be	Twelve zero	3.0
Did it get longer	Yes	0.0
Did it get wider	Yes	0.0
Did he validate what he did	Yes	0.0
You two were not partners am I right	No	0.0
So this one says triple	The Y coordinate	3.0
Do we agree that they used the word coordinate	Yes	1.0
What is it missing	Its missing the description saying how its going to be afterward	3.0
Which one of those is the better explanation	This one	3.0
So if I look at Jakes original book is this book taller	Yes	0.0
Is this book wider	Yes	0.0
But according to their rule its what it should be	Yeah	0.0
Oh what happened here	They didnt finish	0.0
So if I look at this I know that this is what coordinate up here	X	3.0
And this is Y	Y	0.0
Did they do that	Yes	0.0
No they did not	They doubled it	3.0
So my comment here is what one	Triple the Y and triple	3.0
Triple the Y and triple	Triple the Y coordinate	3.0
Triple the Y coordinate	Tripled the X and doubled the	3.0
What one always comes first	X	3.0
So in my explanation what should come first	X	3.0
So it would be 4 and 0 0 and 3 0 and 15 2 and 15 4 and 12 0 and 15 4 and	Thats not right	0.0
Because 4 x 3 is what	Twelve	3.0
So they have to go back and now fix it	That messes up the whole thing	3.0
But it really didnt on theirs because they actually told me there but Im not sure they used the grids that they wrote down	Yeah they dont have that	1.0
Because I dont have anything all the way over to 15 do I	No	0.0
So their whole book is off isnt it	Yeah	0.0
Do you see what Im saying	Yeah	0.0
Yes maam	For our rule you said we should have done ending coordinates	0.0
For our rule you said we should have done ending coordinates	How would we find that	2.0
How would we find that	Oh	0.0
Well at the very end	It would be 24 and 30	3.0
What is	Because we did	0.0
When you are done you are to bring me your work	last night	0.0
You dont have a colored pencil	No	0.0
Youre revising everything that needs to be revised	Okay	0.0
Okay	So with your eraser or no	0.0
You are doing it over in a new pencil	Oh	0.0
I should be able to see the old work and the new work	Okay	0.0
Anyone else need a colored pencil	Can we work together	0.0
Anybody else	Can I use a pen	0.0
Okay	Mines not turning blue	0.0
Mines not turning blue	the only pencil that is sharpened is the white pencil	0.0
Why would you sharpen the white pencil	I didnt	0.0
Oh	I said and none of them were working	0.0
Youll be able to see with that one	So if it doesnt have a	0.0
Yes you may	I dont know how I got this	0.0
Well I would start over and I would match these coordinates	X	0.0
Yes maam	So for the X coordinate would this still be the X coordinate because its going side to side	4.0
So for the X coordinate would this still be the X coordinate because its going side to side	So that would be like the point	4.0
So that would be like the point	I wasnt sure because it goes up a little	4.0
I want to know what changes you made and Im going to start with you Hannah	We multiplied the Y and X coordinates by six times each	3.0
We multiplied the Y and X coordinates by six times each	And do you want to see what I revised	0.0
Tell me what you revised	So first I had in the second question I said We think the book would be six times wider and taller than the original drawing	4.0
So first I had in the second question I said We think the book would be six times wider and taller than the original drawing	And then we said We think this because we were multiplying the X coordinates six times which controls the width	4.0
And then we said We think this because we were multiplying the X coordinates six times which controls the width	We are also multiplying the Y coordinates six times which controls the height	4.0
We are also multiplying the Y coordinates six times which controls the height	And then I added the exact measurements which were the same because I did the same thing they did	4.0
And then I added the exact measurements which were the same because I did the same thing they did	It would be 30 squares	4.0
It would be 30 squares	I have to add that tall	4.0
I have to add that tall	And 24 squares wide	4.0
Should that be in your rule	I dont know	2.0
Did they put the answer to how big it would be in the rule	Yes	0.0
Flip flop that for me	Okay	0.0
Continue though	And then on problem five I crossed out some stuff that I didnt need	4.0
And then on problem five I crossed out some stuff that I didnt need	First it was Our prediction from problem two was correct because the new picture we drew is six times bigger	4.0
First it was Our prediction from problem two was correct because the new picture we drew is six times bigger	And then I said In the X coordinate and the Y coordinate but then I crossed that out and said The widths 24 squares long and 30 squares high	4.0
Should she add something to that	Oh no I was	0.0
Oh no I was	Good	0.0
Good	Yeah	0.0
Did they have the original coordinates in that response	Yes	0.0
So should the original coordinates be in that response	Yes	0.0
You two were partners am I correct	No	0.0
No	Danny	0.0
Danny	Me and Maya were partners	0.0
Zoe tell me what you wrote	In my rule it would be originally how you could double both the X and Y coordinates and I added This makes the book bigger in width and length making the book become 8 in width and 10 in length	4.0
Do we agree that thats a great response for number one	Yes	1.0
Go ahead	And then on number two we originally had I think this new picture will double in size because we are doubling both the X and the Y coordinates	4.0
And then on number two we originally had I think this new picture will double in size because we are doubling both the X and the Y coordinates	This will make the book bigger	4.0
This will make the book bigger	And then I said  in width and length	4.0
And then I said  in width and length	I added that	4.0
Okay	And then on problem five we originally had We know our prediction is correct because the X and Y coordinates doubled which made the book bigger and double in size	4.0
And then on problem five we originally had We know our prediction is correct because the X and Y coordinates doubled which made the book bigger and double in size	We also saw it looked the same but bigger	4.0
We also saw it looked the same but bigger	And I added So that causes the book to become larger in width and height	4.0
Anything	The original coordinates	3.0
Go ahead	So I changed to it was I said I think our new picture will be three times bigger than the original picture	3.0
So I changed to it was I said I think our new picture will be three times bigger than the original picture	And I changed bigger to larger	3.0
Did you add any coordinates in there though	No	0.0
Did you put the finished results throughout using the original and the final	No	0.0
Go ahead Ronnie	So we said that the rule was that it was the	0.0
Tell me what you added	I added to the first one	4.0
I added to the first one	I said Originally we had it so we added one to the Z and Y coordinate	4.0
I said Originally we had it so we added one to the Z and Y coordinate	I said This will make each coordinate one grid larger	4.0
I said This will make each coordinate one grid larger	The book will start at zero five and four one	4.0
The book will start at zero five and four one	And after my rule will be one six and five two	4.0
Why did you use the word grid	Because it goes one block bigger	4.0
On grid paper	Yes	0.0
Excellent job	And then I just added I said that I could have made my rule different so that it made the book larger	4.0
And Im doing you in the order you showed up	I wrote Jake can triple both the X and the Y coordinate to make it larger	3.0
I wrote Jake can triple both the X and the Y coordinate to make it larger	At first I said Y and the X but I switched it	3.0
Sizes	Oh	0.0
Oh	No	0.0
And you can sit and listen so that you have a better understanding	So I first had Multiply the Y and X coordinates six times each	4.0
So I first had Multiply the Y and X coordinates six times each	And then I swapped the Y and X	4.0
And then I swapped the Y and X	And then I said And make sure the X coordinate is at 24 and the Y coordinate is at 30	4.0
And then I said And make sure the X coordinate is at 24 and the Y coordinate is at 30	And then the book drawing	4.0
And then the book drawing	And then I originally had We think the book will be six times wider and taller than the original drawing	4.0
And then I originally had We think the book will be six times wider and taller than the original drawing	We think this because we were multiplying the X coordinate six times which controls the width	4.0
We think this because we were multiplying the X coordinate six times which controls the width	We are also multiplying the Y coordinate which controls the height	4.0
We are also multiplying the Y coordinate which controls the height	And I added We lastly think the X coordinate will be on 24 and our Y coordinate will be on 30	4.0
Make sense	Mmhmm	0.0
Go ahead	And then on this one I originally had Our prediction from problem two was correct because the new picture we drew is six times bigger in the X coordinate and the Y coordinate	4.0
And then on this one I originally had Our prediction from problem two was correct because the new picture we drew is six times bigger in the X coordinate and the Y coordinate	And I changed it to Our prediction from problem two	4.0
I still dont have ending coordinates	that we drew was six times larger than the X coordinate and Y coordinate	4.0
that we drew was six times larger than the X coordinate and Y coordinate	And we also had our X coordinate on 24 and our Y coordinate on 30	4.0
Maddy I think you were next	Okay	0.0
Okay	So for number one we originally said You could double both X and Y coordinates	4.0
So for number one we originally said You could double both X and Y coordinates	And what we changed it to was A rule that Jake can use is to double the X and Y coordinate which would make it 8 and double the Y coordinate which would make it 10	4.0
And what we changed it to was A rule that Jake can use is to double the X and Y coordinate which would make it 8 and double the Y coordinate which would make it 10	When you use those	4.0
Haley you need to be listening because you still have not done what Ive asked you to do	When you use this rule it will make it taller and wider	4.0
When you use this rule it will make it taller and wider	And number two we originally said I think the new picture will double in size because we are doubling both the X and Y coordinate which will make them both bigger	4.0
And number two we originally said I think the new picture will double in size because we are doubling both the X and Y coordinate which will make them both bigger	I just said I think the new picture will double in width because I doubled the X coordinate which is width	4.0
I just said I think the new picture will double in width because I doubled the X coordinate which is width	Also I think the book will be taller because I doubled the Y coordinate	4.0
Go ahead	For number five we originally said We know our prediction is correct because the X and Y coordinates double which made the book double in size	4.0
For number five we originally said We know our prediction is correct because the X and Y coordinates double which made the book double in size	We also saw it looks the same but bigger	4.0
We also saw it looks the same but bigger	And then I said We know our prediction is correct because the X coord got wider because we doubled it and the Y coord got taller because we doubled it	4.0
And then I said We know our prediction is correct because the X coord got wider because we doubled it and the Y coord got taller because we doubled it	The X coord is now 8 and the Y coord is now 10	4.0
Go ahead Matt	Okay	0.0
Okay	So originally we said A rule that Jake can use to make his book picture bigger is he can quadruple the X and Y coordinate to make a bigger picture	4.0
So originally we said A rule that Jake can use to make his book picture bigger is he can quadruple the X and Y coordinate to make a bigger picture	But what I rewrote was The rule that Jake and can to make his picture wider and taller is he can quadruple his X and Y coordinates	4.0
What does it come out to be in the end	I was just saying that	0.0
Oh sorry	And then now My width will be 20 and my width would be 16	3.0
Okay	And then originally we said I think the picture will change and get bigger because he is quadrupling the thing because the binder is	3.0
Whats a thing	The picture	3.0
The picture	Hes quadrupling the picture	4.0
Hes quadrupling the picture	since the binder is he wants the bigger picture for the binder	4.0
since the binder is he wants the bigger picture for the binder	And then what I rewrote was I think that Jakes picture will get wider and taller because I will be quadrupling the X and Y coordinate which is just multiplying it by four	4.0
Did you write that down	Yeah	0.0
Thank you	Then originally for problem five we said our prediction was correct because we said that we would quadruple the coordinates and when we quadrupled it it looked like the original one just bigger	4.0
Then originally for problem five we said our prediction was correct because we said that we would quadruple the coordinates and when we quadrupled it it looked like the original one just bigger	And then when we had written one it was My prediction was correct because my coordinates length was 20 and width was 16	4.0
And then when we had written one it was My prediction was correct because my coordinates length was 20 and width was 16	Because originally I had 5 coordinates and I multiplied that by 4 to get 20	4.0
Because originally I had 5 coordinates and I multiplied that by 4 to get 20	And then my width was 4 so I multiplied it by 4 to get 16	4.0
Did he tell me the mathematical process he used	Yes	0.0
Did he give me what he multiplied together and what the sum was	Yes	0.0
ST or EM	Is the homework 4	0.0
Is the homework 4	10	0.0
Good job	Do you want the fraction paper	0.0
Im going to come around and grab those	I didnt need this part	0.0
I didnt need this part	Or you said	0.0
And you did that just by looking at it with your prediction theres the difference	Okay	0.0
Okay	So and little	0.0
So and little	So when I started the paper if I wrote that	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	Somebodys template is on my desk	0.0
Who	Somebodys	0.0
Somebodys	I dont know	0.0
It was on Johns desk	Mine is in my bag	0.0
Mine is in my bag	Well mines broken and you havent gotten me a new one	0.0
I didnt get you a new one	Mmmm	0.0
I know Alyssa did	410 is the last lesson on the Home Link	0.0
Yes it is	Okay	0.0
May I borrow this please	Yes	0.0
Go ahead	So I said	0.0
Tell me what you said originally and then what you rewrote	Okay	0.0
Okay	I said The rule that Jake quadruple the X coordinate and then triple times the Y coordinate	4.0
I said The rule that Jake quadruple the X coordinate and then triple times the Y coordinate	And then I added on This now means that the book will be 16 15 in width and height	4.0
What is 16 15	Well would it be wait	0.0
Well would it be wait	Would it be 8 or 16	2.0
How wide is the book	Well it goes all the way to 16	3.0
how tall is the book	15	3.0
I dont	Its the coordinate	3.0
You said  This means that the book will be 16 15 inches with width and height	No thats in	0.0
What are those	Coordinates	3.0
Making the book 16 inches	Wide	3.0
And 15 inches	Tall	3.0
Quickly and get back and get this done	I didnt add anything on number two	3.0
I didnt add anything on number two	I	0.0
Tell me	I said We believe that if we enlarge his book X and Y coordinates times three and four	4.0
I said We believe that if we enlarge his book X and Y coordinates times three and four	And now Jakes new book will be taller and longer	4.0
Go ahead through the next one	So for compare your prediction I said  because the book is longer and taller	4.0
So for compare your prediction I said  because the book is longer and taller	So the book was enlarged	4.0
So the book was enlarged	And then I couldnt find out what	0.0
Oh you	I never finished it	0.0
You could not what	I didnt really know what to do for my  because I	2.0
You read through the book and then the only thing you would have needed to add there is your final coordinates	Okay	0.0
Go ahead	My number one that I originally wrote was Jakes rule could be double by three with the X and Y coordinates	3.0
What does double by three mean	I meant triple	3.0
Instead of double you just meant triple both coordinates	Uhhuh	0.0
Okay	And then was Jakes rule could be triple the X and Y coordinates	4.0
And then was Jakes rule could be triple the X and Y coordinates	And it would be taller and wider	4.0
Okay go ahead	What I said on number two was The book is going to be both taller and wider	4.0
What I said on number two was The book is going to be both taller and wider	And then what I added I said Because Jake wants a large book	4.0
So your original answer was correct and you could have simply just said Because this will make the book larger	Okay	0.0
Okay	And then for number five Our prediction was correct because I thought it would be	3.0
And then for number five Our prediction was correct because I thought it would be	Yeah	0.0
Go ahead Ronnie	So I had originally said that you can times them by four	3.0
So I had originally said that you can times them by four	But then I made it and said You can times the X and Y coordinates by four	3.0
Okay much better	And for the second one I originally said It would make a bigger book	3.0
And for the second one I originally said It would make a bigger book	But I changed it to It would be a longer and wider book with four times the X and Y coordinates	3.0
Do those sound like the same thing	Yeah	0.0
No no	So for number five I didnt completely finish it but what I said	0.0
Why did you not completely finish it and youre standing	I ran out of time	0.0
You need to	I	0.0
Go ahead	It was correct because it got taller and wider	4.0
Go ahead Haley	So originally I said You could triple the X and Y coordinate	4.0
So originally I said You could triple the X and Y coordinate	And then I changed it to We can triple the X and Y coordinate which would make it 12 wide and 15 tall which is triple the original	4.0
Much better	And then for number two I originally said It will be three times larger	4.0
And then for number two I originally said It will be three times larger	And then I changed it to It would be three times larger than the original coordinates which were four wide and five tall	4.0
Excellent	And then for number five I said My prediction was correct because it was three times larger than the original coordinates and now it is 12 wide and 15 tall	4.0
Go ahead	Okay	0.0
Okay	So originally I said that Jakes rule needs to triple the X and Y coordinate	4.0
So originally I said that Jakes rule needs to triple the X and Y coordinate	And then what I changed it to is Jakes rule could be that he can times X and Y coordinates by 3 so the X coordinate would be 12 and the Y coordinate would be	4.0
And then what I changed it to is Jakes rule could be that he can times X and Y coordinates by 3 so the X coordinate would be 12 and the Y coordinate would be	It was	0.0
Excellent	Or Y coordinate	3.0
Okay	And then for I said  taller and wider	3.0
And then for I said  taller and wider	And then I changed it to I think that Jakes book will be both taller and wider it	3.0
Okay	And this one so yesterday I didnt get to this question	0.0
And this one so yesterday I didnt get to this question	So I just wrote it	0.0
What did you write today after our learning	So I said that My prediction was correct because the X coordinate was and the Y coordinate was 15 and that means that it was taller and wider	4.0
go ahead	Okay so my original coordinates	0.0
Okay so my original coordinates	So we did On the X one	0.0
So Im just going to go ahead and let you know	I dont get it	2.0
Go ahead Mason Im sorry	So my original one was to from the X and Y coordinate	4.0
So my original one was to from the X and Y coordinate	So it would be one unit taller and one unit wider	4.0
So it would be one unit taller and one unit wider	And then my prediction would be that it would be unit taller and one unit longer	4.0
And then my prediction would be that it would be unit taller and one unit longer	And then I figured that may have been a little too small because he wanted it more bigger	4.0
And then I figured that may have been a little too small because he wanted it more bigger	So I think about that now I should double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate	4.0
So I think about that now I should double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate	So it would be three times taller and then it would be two times wider	4.0
So it would be three times taller and then it would be two times wider	And then my prediction was right for the original one	4.0
And then my prediction was right for the original one	And then for the newer version one it would just be just more wider and longer	4.0
So if your first grid anything times zero is what	Zero	3.0
So where should you book have started	It should have started at zero	3.0
Who was your partner	Zach	0.0
Hey Zach does your book start at zero or one	Let me check	0.0
Let me check	It starts at the bottom of the book	0.0
What is its coordinate	One	3.0
And you added	Because its not multiplication	4.0
Because its not multiplication	0  1 is 1	4.0
Its the exact same size	Oh	0.0
So can your rule work at all	No	0.0
Why	Because its just moving it up one	4.0
So your rule has to be what	Multiplication	3.0
Is it	No	0.0
Okay go ahead	So for number one my original	0.0
Haley I dont think you were dismissed from our group yet	So my original answer was Triple Y coordinate and double the X coordinate	4.0
So my original answer was Triple Y coordinate and double the X coordinate	What I changed it to is Jake could use a rule to double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate	4.0
What I changed it to is Jake could use a rule to double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate	So if a coordinate is 2 4 it will be 4 12 because	4.0
Excellent	And then number two my original answer is It will be taller and wider	4.0
And then number two my original answer is It will be taller and wider	And what I changed it to is that it will look like a taller and wider book because the X coordinate is getting doubled as the books width and the Y coordinate is getting tripled as the books height	4.0
Excellent	And then five Our prediction was correct because we said it would be taller and we also said it would be wider	4.0
And then five Our prediction was correct because we said it would be taller and we also said it would be wider	And Yes it got taller and yes it also got wider	4.0
Thank you	So for number one I originally had The rule that Jake should use is to quadruple times the X coordinate	4.0
So for number one I originally had The rule that Jake should use is to quadruple times the X coordinate	And Jake could triple times the Y coordinate to enlarge the book	4.0
And Jake could triple times the Y coordinate to enlarge the book	And I didnt know what you meant by add numbers	4.0
And I didnt know what you meant by add numbers	So I just said I wrote  from the original coordinates that went from the height of five to the width of four	4.0
So I just said I wrote  from the original coordinates that went from the height of five to the width of four	And then for question number two I said We believe that if we enlarge both X and Y coordinates times three and four Jakes new book will be taller and longerwider	4.0
And then for question number two I said We believe that if we enlarge both X and Y coordinates times three and four Jakes new book will be taller and longerwider	So I didnt change that	4.0
Where did you get that	Oh I was talking	0.0
Oh your ending coordinates are four and five right	No I was talking about this book	0.0
No I was talking about this book	I said the original coordinates on this one	0.0
I said the original coordinates on this one	I meant	0.0
And then what would they be if you tripled each of those	They would be 15 and 16	3.0
Good job	Okay and then for number five I said My prediction was correct because in question number two I said that the book would look taller and longer and when I drew the new book on the grid it became taller and longer	4.0
Okay	And then I finished	0.0
Blake youre up buddy	For the first one I didnt change it	3.0
For the first one I didnt change it	It is	0.0
What did you write the first time	Quadruple both of the coordinates	3.0
And what is going to be your end result	Its going to be bigger and	3.0
Go ahead continue because youll go back and add what youre missed	And for the second one I wrote It would look like a book but much much bigger wider and longer	3.0
Whats it going to be	Its going to be wider and longer	3.0
Go ahead	And for question five I wrote It was correct because it is bigger longer and wider	3.0
So my question to you is is this book redrawn using a straight edge	Originally I used a straight edge but	0.0
Okay go ahead	So what I said first was Triple the Y coordinate and double the X coordinate	4.0
So what I said first was Triple the Y coordinate and double the X coordinate	What I said after is What Jake can do for his rule is double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate to make the book taller and wider	4.0
Did you give me end result numbers	No	0.0
Go ahead	What I said for the second one is The book after I double the X coordinate and triple the Y coordinate it should be taller and larger	4.0
Excellent	And then for number five I said Our prediction is correct because we said it would be taller and wider and Y coordinates met together to make the shape of the book	4.0
Okay go ahead	I said Jake can double both the X and the Y coordinates and make the book taller and wider	4.0
So what do you have to add there	The coordinate	3.0
The ending result which would be	Eight and ten	3.0
Very good	And then I said I think the picture of the book will be bigger because we are going to double the X and the Y	4.0
Okay	Then I said My prediction was correct because the picture was taller and wider	3.0
Those are the two things you may do	And its 410 right	3.0
So what was your end coordinate here	Okay	0.0
Okay	So 12	3.0
And	Fifteen	3.0
Taller and	Wider	3.0
They added	Do I have to redraw it	0.0
Do I have to redraw it	Because I dont have any room left to do that	0.0
Just rewrite your rule	Okay	0.0
Ronnie	Did you say wider and taller	0.0
Wider and taller	I said I think	0.0
You might be able to	Its the regular school kind	0.0
Is it my charger	Yeah	0.0
Okay	If I cant find it	0.0
Yours is on my desk	Oh	0.0
Yes	This parts kind of easy	0.0
Everybody	Common denominators	3.0
Thatll be your exit ticket out the door	All right so	0.0
Okay  what did you get for the first one	I got four and ninetenths	3.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
Julia what did you get for the next one	84 and threetenths	3.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
And the last one	I got 437 and sixtenths	3.0
How are you	Good	0.0
Good	Mmhmm	0.0
Excellent	Yeah	0.0
Cool	Im going to	0.0
what did you get for the first one buddy	12 and 84 hundredths	3.0
what did you get for the next one	For the second one I got 927 and 51 hundredths	3.0
Okay and for the final one	I got 75 hundredths	3.0
Okay was that pretty easy for everybody	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Im going to have the two of you compare your answers talk about what you did	The two SSs	0.0
The two SSs	Or the	0.0
And you two come up here for me	We just checked answers	0.0
And did your answers agree	Yes	1.0
So did your answers agree	second one she got it wrong but we figured it out	1.0
What discussion did you have when you realized what she got wrong	She did	0.0
She did	So she knew that she had to borrow from to get to a number that she can subtract	4.0
So she knew that she had to borrow from to get to a number that she can subtract	And she took out one more and I saw that she had ninethirds on her paper before she	4.0
And she took out one more and I saw that she had ninethirds on her paper before she	And I realized what she did because she took one whole and added one to the whole and she did a 10 and not a third because the denominator is three	4.0
And I realized what she did because she took one whole and added one to the whole and she did a 10 and not a third because the denominator is three	So she did 10 plus one equals 11 when it should have been three plus one	4.0
Gentlemen	I would agree with what she just said	1.0
I am too because Zoe what denominator do you have in your answer for number two	A third	3.0
Does anything times two equal three	No	0.0
So how can three be your common denominator	That is the same denominator	3.0
Okay	So Julia took one whole from the three and she took it as a 10 because thats what  but really it wouldve been three	4.0
So Julia took one whole from the three and she took it as a 10 because thats what  but really it wouldve been three	And then plus one would be four	4.0
And then plus one would be four	But she did 10 plus one equals 11	4.0
How are they different	They are different because they dont have	0.0
They are different because they dont have	Wait what do you mean by	2.0
How is problem one different from problem two	Problem one is different from problem	0.0
Problem one is different from problem	Okay	0.0
Okay	How problem one is different from problem two was that on problem one they had common denominators other numbers but in problem two Oh wait	3.0
Phone a friend please	In problem one you could just do easy subtraction	3.0
In problem one you could just do easy subtraction	But in problem two	0.0
Why could I do easy subtraction in problem one	Because its just one minus four	4.0
Because its just one minus four	And then	0.0
Is it one minus four	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
I cant take four from one	I mean four minus one	3.0
4 minus one thank you	And then in the other one you have to take from the whole for the fractions	3.0
Evan repeat what your new learning is about please	So what he said was do four minus one because you dont need to take from the whole number	4.0
So what he said was do four minus one because you dont need to take from the whole number	But then in the second one you had to take from the whole number to do it	4.0
Thats not what I wanted there	Oh	0.0
Oh	Theres the real question	0.0
Oh I forgot to ask what was the estimate you used on the first one Mark	I estimate it was five minus one equals four	4.0
did you use a fraction in your estimate	Oh no	0.0
So those of you that didnt raise your hand  what did you use	Four minus one equals three	4.0
Problem one is the	Its four and fourfifth minus one and onefifth	3.0
Its four and fourfifth minus one and onefifth	Yes	1.0
Yes	Shes right	1.0
Shes right	Maybe its in the next one	0.0
Maybe its in the next one	Maybe it was on the next one	0.0
So  what mistake did you make by keeping that four	I see that its closer to closer to one	3.0
Yes sir	Its the exact same thing look	4.0
Its the exact same thing look	Because theres three whole circles and then theres a circle	4.0
Okay so now we are going to do an estimate of because these are not the next problems on the page am I correct	They are	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
So what is	I already know whats going on	0.0
Is nine times closer to one or a half	One	3.0
So is ninetenths closer to one or a half	one	3.0
So is eigthtenth closer to one or a half	One	3.0
explain to me why I cant just subtract this	Because they have different	4.0
So now what do I have to do Gage	You just need to do three minus	3.0
What step do I need to take next	Four times three	3.0
What am I multiplying this one by	Two	3.0
And what does that equal	I got six	3.0
Austin whats nine minus four	Five	3.0
And what is my new fraction	Five	3.0
Excellent job	Yeah I got that	0.0
Good	Oh	0.0
Haley did you get this one	No	0.0
Three and onethird	Minus	3.0
So	The next one is	0.0
They are mixed numbers right now easier if I turned it into one	No its not its seven	3.0
How do I do it buddy	Plus that by 16	3.0
Plus that by 16	I mean by seven	3.0
Haley explain again please	Use the clues to write the mystery number	0.0
Use the clues to write the mystery number	I have	0.0
What am I multiplying	No	0.0
No	How is that a two	2.0
Just join Oh okay	Round it down	3.0
Round it down	So 0	3.0
And if you did it together and everybodys right continue working together on this	Okay	0.0
Okay	And the last one	2.0
And the last one	We didnt get the same on the last one so And I got five	1.0
You have to turn this into an improper fraction	Did you get that	2.0
Did you get that	Yes	1.0
Im going to wait for everybody to get done	Im almost done	0.0
fraction	Julia joined us because she	0.0
Bum ba dum bum bum	Bum bum	0.0
We did this before the virtual when we were remote	Oh	0.0
Has anybody do you think your boss will say hey I want you to do some addition of decimals but I want you to do it in partial sums	No	0.0
What just happened	Uh oh	0.0
Uh oh	What did just happen	0.0
And then standard notation	Whats standard notation	2.0
Standard notation	Oh	0.0
What do you think Amy	Is it just normally	3.0
The numbers	Yeah	0.0
Okay so what is standard notation do you think	Words	3.0
There you go	So were doing stand notation first right	3.0
The standard form everybody was what	Two and 49 hundredths	3.0
Sit down when you are done	Do we have to do the dash in between	0.0
Do we have to do the dash in between	Like 49	0.0
Sit down when you are done	We have to sit down this one	0.0
We have to sit down this one	So you should be standing	0.0
And I just saw her walk in	Wait her water bottles here	0.0
Thats not how we do math	No	0.0
20 plus 80 is	100	3.0
Four plus five is	Nine	3.0
On your whiteboards	We add them	0.0
Yes sir	She just said that	0.0
She just said that	You love me	0.0
I love you	Okay thank you	0.0
So it was 284	Plus 435	3.0
You should be up here with Haley	Kate and Blake	0.0
Haley go ahead explain what you did	So I first did 45 then I did 8 plus 11 and I was confused if I carry the one or not so I decided not to and put 11 down and then two plus four which equals six	4.0
No turn it up so everyone can see	So I did five plus four is nine	4.0
So I did five plus four is nine	And then I did eight plus three is one no eight plus three is 11 and I carried the one	4.0
And then I did eight plus three is one no eight plus three is 11 and I carried the one	And four plus two is six	4.0
And four plus two is six	Plus one is seven	4.0
So how come you carried the one	Oh this	0.0
Okay so explain why you carried that one Austin	Because it comes to an 11	4.0
Because it comes to an 11	And I put the one up here and 11	4.0
Blake tell me what you did	I did	0.0
Thank you	What I did is four plus five is nine	4.0
What I did is four plus five is nine	Eight plus three is 11	4.0
Eight plus three is 11	I put the one right there	4.0
I put the one right there	I put the other one right here	4.0
I put the other one right here	Four plus two is six plus one is seven	4.0
Did you think Haley was right	Yeah	0.0
Start talking	Okay	0.0
Okay	So eight plus three is 11	4.0
So eight plus three is 11	But	4.0
But	I think you should carry the one because its moving up to the next place value because its not just one its 11	4.0
Add to it Zach	You cant have because theres not another place value after 10 so theres not because once you get to 10 once you get 10 ones it turns into a 10	4.0
You cant have because theres not another place value after 10 so theres not because once you get to 10 once you get 10 ones it turns into a 10	You dont have 100 and zero 10s	4.0
You dont have 100 and zero 10s	It turns into since 10 tens is equivalent to one	4.0
We are not	Yay	0.0
Whats that word	Align	3.0
Is 2 310 closer to two or three	Two	3.0
So it would be two plus	Eight	3.0
So youre does it make it closer to seven or does it make it closer to eight	Eight	3.0
If I have zero tenths am I closer to seven	Oh okay	0.0
Or am I closer to eight	Seven	3.0
See	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
Okay	is this pages	0.0
Yes the one	Yeah	0.0
And then as soon as you	It is	0.0
Okay	Do I just do the first page	0.0
Yes everyone needs to	Oh okay	0.0
Does that make more sense	Yeah	0.0
Okay	Thats 17	3.0
Thats 17	Thats 17	3.0
So what is a whole number James	Its	0.0
Im sorry what	Its a whole number that matches up with the denominator	3.0
Thats a great way to put that	Whole number A fraction is a whole number split into different pieces but the whole number is all the pieces together	3.0
Its going to be easier than you think	Well now I understand it	0.0
I dont think I did	I dont know	0.0
I dont know	No	0.0
I know I didnt	Theyre going to call down for a reason	0.0
Theyre going to call down and yell at me again	Theyre going to Do your attendance	0.0
Keanus my only friend out right	Yes I think so	0.0
Aaron	The word strategy means official thing that you use to help you solve an equation	3.0
Mason you want to add to that	Strategy are different ideas on how to solve something	3.0
Excellent	Could you say techniques on how to solve problems	3.0
So in math we call those techniques what	Strategies	3.0
Al	Algorithms	3.0
All right so	Blackboard	0.0
Eric number one explain what you did and what number you came up with	I came up with 90	4.0
I came up with 90	And how I did that was I looked at the 8 and then I went to the right and it was a 7	4.0
And how I did that was I looked at the 8 and then I went to the right and it was a 7	So I turned it	4.0
So I turned it	It was over 5 so I need to round it up and turn it into a 90	4.0
Michael why do you disagree with that	Because it said Round to the nearest whole not tenth	4.0
Zach	Because we were supposed to round off of the decimal	4.0
Because we were supposed to round off of the decimal	We were supposed to turn the decimal number into a whole number not just change the	4.0
What is the correct response everyone		3.0
What did you do with 99 and 12 hundredths	I looked over to the decimal and  to the right	3.0
So what was your answer	991	3.0
Notice Haleys words were I looked to the what side of the 1	Right	3.0
And Julia what did you do for the third one		3.0
How did you get that	Because it said round to the nearest tenth and I looked to the right of the tenth and it  more so we can	4.0
Agree	Yes	1.0
Go	Just one and two	0.0
I want you to do the best you can	Okay	0.0
Okay so no worries	I think we didnt do this because we have	0.0
Turn back to your	I dont think I did it right	3.0
Go ahead buddy	I basically just divided 5 times 1 for this 15 this	3.0
I basically just divided 5 times 1 for this 15 this	Well you can split a whole number into 5  times	3.0
So please explain what you did	I thought because its times 15 and 15 goes into the whole five times	4.0
I thought because its times 15 and 15 goes into the whole five times	I got three	4.0
And do you agree with that	Yes	1.0
How did you know to divide	Because 15 isnt quite a whole number yet and dividing just seems easier in my head than multiplying it times a number	4.0
Okay	Its because I hold my  and thats basically	0.0
Okay the 3 times 15 does it equal 15	No but 15 times	3.0
I put 3 instead of 15 and turn it in	You just said	0.0
3 and 1 is		3.0
And 3 and 5 is		3.0
Blake who was your partner	Mason	0.0
And what did you get for problem number one	For the first question we got 3	3.0
Explain to me how you got 3	Well I split 5 into fifths and it was 3	4.0
Well I split 5 into fifths and it was 3	If you took	0.0
Did you really take 5 and split		3.0
Good job	I did that with every single one and figured out how much was onefifth of it	3.0
So what I got was For the  I got 4	And how did you get it	3.0
How did you make this work	How I made this work was that What I do is  forward and the I got 20 so then I knew it was the L number was 4	4.0
Blake did his by	Division	3.0
Mason did his with	Multiplication	3.0
And Rob tell me how you did the next one	Okay so what I did for the third one is 7 times 5 equals 35	4.0
Okay so what I did for the third one is 7 times 5 equals 35	so I dont want to multiply the denominator  the numerator  and I got 70	4.0
Did you not answer a Mental Math	Oh yeah I did	0.0
Lily go ahead and tell me how you did the next one	I did 5 times  equals  so I did	3.0
What strategy did you use because strategy is our word	So my  algorithm that I used  its the rule is divide by 5 so I just divided 15 by 5 and got my answer of 3	4.0
Eric tell me about the next one	For 20	0.0
For 20	Okay	0.0
Okay	What I did was	0.0
What I did was	I just did 5 divided by 20 and got 4	4.0
Ethan tell me how you did the next one	I did 7	3.0
I did 7	I mean 35 divided by 5 and got 7	4.0
And Zoe tell me about the last one	I did 10 divided by 5 and	3.0
Why did we do it that way	Because it looked easier	4.0
Did you all learn a new strategy	Yes	0.0
I know there were three questions	It was Julia Eric and Haley	0.0
Your whole number a fraction is no different than a fraction of a whole number	So you could just do	0.0
The people that did not stand up when I said If your answers were the same did at least one of you have the right answer	Yes	0.0
How is that going to work because its now three steps	whatever the 5 so 5 times 3 equals 15	4.0
whatever the 5 so 5 times 3 equals 15	Then you do the 3  line	4.0
Logan Im going to you the next one and if you dont know please be honest	I dont know  this option	2.0
So Julia explain the rule that you knew you could use	So the rule I used is a fraction of because they just replace the word of with a multiplication symbol	4.0
Okay so Julia what was the next question that I asked you	How would you solve this problem	3.0
So Julia would you please tell the class how you did 15 of 35	So first you would you would figure out 5 times what equals 15 and 5 times 3 equals 15	4.0
So first you would you would figure out 5 times what equals 15 and 5 times 3 equals 15	So then you would take the 3 and you would multiply it by the 3 on top and that would be 9	4.0
So then you would take the 3 and you would multiply it by the 3 on top and that would be 9	So then 9 would be the out	4.0
So go ahead	Im saying that you could first multiply 15 divided by 5 or sorry divide 15 by 5 which is 3	4.0
Im saying that you could first multiply 15 divided by 5 or sorry divide 15 by 5 which is 3	And then you multiply that 3 by 3 since its times 3 and then the answers 9	4.0
Did you have another strategy	Well I dont know if it would really work	2.0
So Im going to ask Amy to talk about her thinking so that my friend  they have two different ways to do this	So my thinking at first I dont know if this will work though it would be like 5 divided by 3 but I dont know if you can really do 5 divided by 3	4.0
So my thinking at first I dont know if this will work though it would be like 5 divided by 3 but I dont know if you can really do 5 divided by 3	And then you would times 15 by the answer of what you got of 5 divided by 3 or 3 divided by 5	4.0
Talk while youre doing it though	Okay so Im going to do 3 divided by wait	3.0
Okay so Im going to do 3 divided by wait	5 divided	1.0
5 divided	I think I said that at first	1.0
You said 5 divided by 3	All right	0.0
All right	So 5 divided by 3	3.0
So 5 divided by 3	Wait did I say that	0.0
5 divided by 3	Okay	0.0
Okay	It would be 2	3.0
What is 3 times 2		3.0
Okay so we know we cant do 2 can we	Uhhuh	0.0
So we can only go how many times	Once and it would be remainder 2 so 1 remainder 2	3.0
But it would be 1 and 23	Yeah	0.0
So I would like you write 1 and 23 down	I dont think what Oh	0.0
Then you said you would do what	And then you would multiply 1 and 23 by 15	3.0
Okay so multiply 1 and 23 by 15	Oh	0.0
Oh	No that doesnt work that way	3.0
No that doesnt work that way	Hold on	0.0
Why does it not work that way	Because you cant	0.0
Whats 1 times 5		3.0
I mean 1 times 15 Im sorry		3.0
Alyssa do you have something you would like to add	We thought that would be the same as we did the first one	3.0
Explain how you did the first one	We said that you could do the whole number divided by the denominator times the numerator for the first one	3.0
I love the fact What words did you just use	Numerator and denominator	3.0
And why would you have used numerator and denominator	Because its the fraction	4.0
So does it work out the same way Zachs does	I think so yeah	1.0
Explain your thinking doing the problem	So	0.0
So you made that	15 divided by 5 would be 3	4.0
15 divided by 5 would be 3	And 3 times 3 is 9	4.0
Tell me your new understanding of this	Divided	3.0
So if you choose a method to do this what did you think is the easiest way to do it	I thought the easiest way to do it was	0.0
Yes maam	On the very first one I got a bunch of All of them are wrong	3.0
Okay	They make more sense in my head because I just	0.0
They make more sense in my head because I just	So a fifth of 15 is 3 and then I did 3 times 15 and a fifth times 15 but I dont understand why it wouldnt work because I got 45	4.0
So a fifth of 15 is 3 and then I did 3 times 15 and a fifth times 15 but I dont understand why it wouldnt work because I got 45	I changed it but	0.0
So because can I really have 45 pieces in 15	No	0.0
You did	A fifth of 15 is 3 times 15 is	3.0
Youre in should be bigger than your out	Okay	0.0
Okay	I did 15 times 5 is 75 and then 75 is a factor of 15 because 15 times 5 is 75	4.0
I did 15 times 5 is 75 and then 75 is a factor of 15 because 15 times 5 is 75	So then I changed it back to 15	4.0
So do you understand why it was not the right way to do it	Yeah	0.0
I didnt have the answer right off the bat did I	Uhuh	0.0
One two and three	Together	0.0
You may not lay on the floor to do this because we dont lay down at school	Can you sit	0.0
So what would it be	Times 20 divided by	3.0
So write 26 times 26		3.0
Okay	And also on problem three 8 doesnt go into 20	3.0
How did I get that 9	numerator	3.0
If my in is 12	2 is 12	3.0
Does it make sense	Yeah	0.0
Times 2 and divided by		3.0
So do I have to come up with some kind of common denominator	Yes	0.0
Yes	Minus 2	3.0
What is 13 divided by 3		3.0
	Nothing goes into 13 except 1	3.0
Nothing goes into 13 except 1	13 is stupid	0.0
He actually divided 13 divided by 3	Not even 13 goes into 13	3.0
So 4 and a third and then	So that would be 8 and	3.0
Tell me	Because you have 2 and then	4.0
Zach Bomp ba da bomp bomp	Bomp bomp	0.0
Let me guess your hand are in the air because you turned the page and didnt know how to do number one	Yes	0.0
Yes	Number one and number 17	2.0
Number one and number 17	Number one and number three	2.0
You may get your	Okay	0.0
my	She said to start here	0.0
Okay thats better	Number one and number three are impossible	2.0
Youre all going to need to stand	Everybody	0.0
So my problem here is 13 is it 2	23	3.0
23	Times 23	3.0
Tell me what answer you got	We got 9	3.0
Okay give me your answer	We said 8 at first	3.0
Okay	8 and 23	3.0
8 and 23	8 and 23	1.0
I would like you guys to give me your strategy that you used to do this	We tried to find the closest to 13 because we knew that nothing times 3 equals 13 so we did 4 and 3 equals 12	4.0
Okay	And then we did 4 times 2 is 8	4.0
And then we did 4 times 2 is 8	And then there was 23 left	4.0
And then there was 23 left	So you subtract the 8 from the 12	4.0
So what she did is 3 times what is going to get me closest to 14 or 13		3.0
Haley what did you originally say we had to do	We had to divide 3 times 13	3.0
Did I have to divide 3 times 13 or divide 13		3.0
Well Haley immediately came up with what	4 remainder 1	3.0
Go ahead	So we already know that theres 4 remainder 1 and then since its 13 times 23 its not 13 we have to multiply	4.0
Did I come out with 4 remainder 1	Yeah	0.0
What did I come out with	4 remainder 13	3.0
Then what did you do	Then since its 23 we have to multiply 4 and 13 times 2 which is 8 and 23	4.0
Yes maam	I want to warn you	0.0
Tell us what it is	I did 13 over 1 times 23	3.0
Okay	And then	0.0
Equals 263	I have 26 lines	3.0
26 lines	And then I put as many as I could in threes	3.0
So theres one theres two theres three and four and five and six and seven and eight	And then theres two left	3.0
Whichever way is easiest to do this does it come out to be the same every single time	Yes	0.0
So you got the right answer but I dont know how	Its a fourth times  because	4.0
Its a fourth times  because	4 times 4 is 16	4.0
Youre still missing the fraction	Yeah I had to go back	3.0
Thank you darling	10 feet of ribbon  on a large	3.0
But is that really the right answer	Oh wait	0.0
Im going to let them finish this because I interrupted his thought	In the classroom theres four steps	3.0
The same thing	2 divided by 3 is 23	4.0
Thats what it wants you to do	Im confused already	2.0
Im confused already	division strategy for this one	3.0
How many times does 8 go into 20	On a large	0.0
Twice	How much ribbon does she use	2.0
So I have 2 and 48 and what do I need to times	Carrie	0.0
Was she	She used 45 of it and to tie a bow on a large gift how much ribbon does she use	0.0
I know that 5 times 2 is 10 right	In a classroom theres 14 cubbies	0.0
In a classroom theres 14 cubbies	Along the wall each cubbie holds six	0.0
Along the wall each cubbie holds six	How long is the line of cubbies	0.0
Did you guys get that	We said 12	3.0
I would like you to do the back with your partner	Miss	0.0
Yeah	We finished	0.0
We finished	Are we only supposed to go to three	0.0
Are we only supposed to go to three	23 so I dont know	2.0
23 so I dont know	Well we know that the answer is the same because its the same problem	4.0
What is my in number friends	The in number is 13	3.0
Oh	Oh	0.0
I love it when your little brains go the lights	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Howd you get 26	2.0
Did we use an area model yesterday	Yes	0.0
Remember I showed you the easy way to do this yesterday didnt I	Yeah	0.0
All right	Thats a good way to check your answer	3.0
So two fifths 1 2 3 4 5 they colored in two of those fifths right	Mmhmm	0.0
And what is the answer	Fourfifteenths	3.0
And how many of them are shaded with those colors	Four	3.0
May I get over here and get my warmer coat	Sure	0.0
Thank you	It is kind of cold in here	0.0
Thats you said true on your very first one	I was supposed to say false	3.0
Explain it to me	I thought it meant five tenths is larger than	3.0
So less than means what	Smaller	3.0
So we agree that fivetenths is less than forty nine hundredths	No	1.0
Because I have five whole tenths but I have forty nine hundredths which shows me that I only have four tenths and then the nine hundredths	Yeah	0.0
What do you think Eric	I think thats false	3.0
How come	Its one in eightyeights and one	3.0
Eightyeight hundredths	Thousandths	3.0
Thousandths	Yeah and versus ninetenths thats just automatically bigger than it	1.0
Right	Nine is bigger than eight	3.0
And the last one Mr Mason twelve and thirty five hundredths is less than twelve in four hundredths	I thought that that was true	0.0
Okay	Because twelve in thirty five hundredths is broken down into smaller pieces and twelve in four tenths is bigger than twelve thirty five hundredths	4.0
Now put your dry erase or caps on	Can we erase	0.0
Six in sevenhundred and eighty five thousandths is greater than six in seventy nine hundredths	I said it was false because well no its true becauseum	3.0
Which one is going to be bigger	Um six in seventynine hundredths	3.0
So is this true or false		3.0
Okay	Oh wow	0.0
Explain to me why thats false	Um I didnt really know what the question was	2.0
Um I didnt really know what the question was	I	0.0
Explain to me why this is false	Um this is false because one is um zero nine nine the one will prevail because theres a zero before the ninety nine	4.0
So which is smaller	The the ninetynine thousandths	3.0
Ninetynine thousandths is less than so shouldnt it have been true versus your false	I I thought you said that false was first	3.0
And youre going to do twothirds of twothirds	Can you solve it	0.0
Mr Ethan	Yes	0.0
Tell me were going to do a little sage and scribe here	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
I would like you to tell me how to make my area model first	So first I split it into thirds	3.0
And what way did you do thirds	I did it the um	0.0
This way	Yeah	0.0
I broke it into thirds for this one	And then I color two in	3.0
Like that Mr Ethan	And then I broke it into another third  to be	3.0
And how did I how did you break that one into thirds	I went down	3.0
Like this	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	And then I colored two more in	3.0
Like this	Yeah	0.0
Okay	And then I had four double shades so itd be four down	3.0
These four boxes here are	Are double shaded	3.0
So what is my answer	Fourninths	3.0
I have four boxes double shaded	And nine total	3.0
Now Austin tell me the easy way to do this	Um so were going to do 3 times 3	3.0
And what does that equal	Um 9	3.0
Then what do I do	Then you do 2 times 2 equals 4	4.0
Then you do 2 times 2 equals 4	And then you get 4	4.0
So	Can we may erase	0.0
Is the product greater than or less than the factors	Alone	0.0
Alone	Like the factor alone	0.0
Charlotte	Yes	0.0
Tell me why	Because twothirds is bigger than fourninths	4.0
Twothirds is bigger than fourninths right	Mmhmm	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
What are these called	Tick marks	3.0
Thank you for working with me	Thank you for working with me	0.0
What what do we use them for	So if you were to put them into groups you would represent the  If you if you	3.0
Agree or disagree	Agree	1.0
Alison what did you and your partner talk about	Um me and my partner talked about the tick marks were there because they were helping us place the lines so we know where to plot the lines so we can have our fractions	4.0
Morgan can you build off that please	Um	0.0
Specifically	Me and my partner did um we are doing that the tick marks could be for coordinate grids	3.0
Aaron	What me and my partner said is to divide the squares	3.0
To divide the squares into what Josh	Thirds	3.0
Thirds	Um maybe even squares	1.0
Well Zach what do you want to add	I think I said that the its kind of like a coordinate grids where like if onethird twothird threethirds	3.0
We are not locating anything so its like a coordinate grid in breaking it down to the size of the	Fraction	3.0
You know why this called an area model right	Because it helps you find	0.0
Because it helps you find the area excellent	Wow	0.0
Wow	It doesnt want to move	0.0
It doesnt want to move	It doesnt want to go	0.0
How does this area relate to multiplication Will	Um	0.0
How does this area model relate to multiplication	Um so I thought we	0.0
Im sorry what	Um I said so then the  you dont have to do 3 times 3	3.0
Why would I why am I multiplying 3 times 3	Because of the d	0.0
Because its called the what	D	0.0
D	Denominator	3.0
Label yours	Oh um	0.0
I want just to see how everybody labels it	Wait like labeling	0.0
Come up here and explain what you did my darling	Oh this is not working	0.0
Please be nice to me today	Are you going to kick the smartboard	0.0
Okay	Since we were shading since for the problem where we had to shade two thirds here this would be	4.0
Since we were shading since for the problem where we had to shade two thirds here this would be	So for the problem we had to shade twothirds so it would be twothirds here because you would shade these twothirds	4.0
So for the problem we had to shade twothirds so it would be twothirds here because you would shade these twothirds	And then for the problem we had to do twothirds here so you had to shade these twothirds and then there would be one third	4.0
And then for the problem we had to do twothirds here so you had to shade these twothirds and then there would be one third	But we dont do one third for the problem	4.0
But we dont do one third for the problem	But that would be one third	4.0
Or do they only represent it showing two of the thirds shaded	They only represent showing two	3.0
One third two thirds which leaves me how many thirds	Four	3.0
Four what	Ninths	3.0
But if I break that into ninths if I label it one ninth two ninths I dont have enough ninths do I	No	0.0
Thank you my love	Mmhmm	0.0
No its not Will	Is it 1 by 1	3.0
Charlotte	Um	0.0
Area	Is it 3	3.0
Is it 3	Or no	0.0
Whats the formula for area	Length times width	3.0
Multiply my length times my width	9	3.0
9	1	1.0
If the if its one by one	Oh 2	3.0
Oh 2	What	0.0
Okay whats our misconception Zach	Shes adding the 2 or shes adding 1 and 1 not multiplying 1 and 1	1.0
Shes adding the 2 or shes adding 1 and 1 not multiplying 1 and 1	Oh	0.0
Whats 1 times 1	1	3.0
Haley	Yes	0.0
What are the dimensions of the shaded um	What the heck	0.0
Im trying to move it	What is that	0.0
What is that	Whoa	0.0
Whoa	What	0.0
What	You just made it go smaller	0.0
What are the dimensions of the shaded squares	2 by two thirds by two thirds	3.0
What is the area of the shaded rectangle John	Um	0.0
Area of the shaded rectangle	Four ninths	3.0
And Michael what would the multiplication sentence be	2 times 2	3.0
2 times 2	Twothirds times twothirds	3.0
And what does that equal Michael	Four ninths	3.0
So Im going to see if it filled these in for me so I can show you how they	Wait if you scroll down maybe on the other one no	0.0
So then the area would be length times width which is 1 times 1 equals everybody		3.0
So Haley jumped up and said Oh well the dimensions of the shaded are its two thirds here and two thirds here do you understand why you couldnt write one third one third one third one third	Yeah	0.0
Because then	It would be onethird by onethird	3.0
And onethird by onethird is only	One third	3.0
Well first thing we need to figure out is how many are shaded 4 and how many total pieces do we have together now	Nine	3.0
You guys in the back stay where you are	You want us to move our desks	0.0
Aaron Nate John youre going to come place yourselves in this middle area right here	Im standing up	0.0
What are these tick marks worth	Dont know	0.0
So the top number or the bottom number	Bottom	3.0
You did both pages	Oh both	0.0
What do you think theyre worth	Threesixteenths	3.0
Mason explain to me	Uh I think it was uh in fourths	3.0
Why is it in fourths Michael uh I mean Mason	Because the um the smaller	4.0
So if I label this its going to be one fourth	One fourth	0.0
Noah does that make sense	Uhhuh	0.0
What are you confused about	That the	0.0
If I have one fourth two fourths three fourths here Noah what am I going to have here	Uh one fourth	3.0
What did you write	Multiply by denominator	3.0
What did you write	Um I dont understand but	2.0
What did you write Charlotte	Um I wrote 1 by 1	3.0
What	I wrote 1 by 1	3.0
So first of all how do I find area Austin	Um	0.0
Nope what is the model for area	Length times width	3.0
Okay whatd you get	One fourth	3.0
Go ahead Michael	Sixteen	3.0
So sixteen is the whole	So first time	0.0
Will do you see where he got it	I	0.0
So now I want you to write a multiplication sentence for this	Two sixths	3.0
Two sixths	Uh I got three fourths and two sixths	1.0
Uh I got three fourths and two sixths	I got three fourths and two sixths	1.0
I got three fourths and two sixths	I got two sixths and three fourths	1.0
I got two sixths and three fourths	Its the same	1.0

Okay then what did you do down here	Uh I did one fourth	3.0
Why do you disagree Charlotte	Because its not	0.0
See where you made your mistake	Yeah	0.0
What are the dimensions of the shaded rectangles	Um	0.0
Who did not agree who did not have this part	I accidentally	0.0
What is the area of the shaded rectangle Will	Um the area of the shaded rectangle  would be	0.0

What one do you do last	Y	3.0
What have we been working on for the last three days	Fractions	3.0
Fractions	Algorithm	1.0
And what way to do that	Fractions	3.0
And whats an area model Austin	I dont know	2.0
What area models have we used to solve a half of a fourth	Paper	3.0
And what have we done with that paper	We folded it	3.0
We folded it into what	Fractions	3.0
What other way did we do it James	By timesing the denominators	3.0

First of all I need to ask Mason what is your daily affirmation today Mason	Huh	0.0
What was your daily affirmation today	It was work hard and smile more	0.0
Did you work hard to try and solve this problem	No	0.0
What	I mean yes	0.0
If youre working hard youre not doing bad selftalk are you	No	0.0
Im going to do it one more round and I want you to use your resources change your attitude as I know that if youve got positive attitude what are you doing underneath that mask	Smiling	0.0
Can you explain what happened	Well Im not sure	2.0
Well Im not sure	He kind of got it but he did say I have a six in front	1.0
If I round to the nearest whole number what is six going to be	Six	3.0
Round to the nearest tenth whats my number going to be	61	3.0
And if I round to the nearest hundredth	61 or 14 hundredths	3.0
Does that make sense	Your microphone is	0.0
My microphone is wonky because Ive got this thing on too	Youve got two microphones	0.0
Okay do that make sense	Yes	0.0
Okay were going to try it one more time	Can we erase	0.0
All right	Im sorry	0.0
What happened with you and your partner	So we got different answers but for the first part we got the first one right	1.0
So we got different answers but for the first part we got the first one right	The second one we didnt agree on	1.0
The second one we didnt agree on	I did five tenths and then he did six tenths	1.0
Can you explain that to Connor	Because the one before the eight Five	4.0
Because the one before the eight Five	You go back to look if the one is above five	4.0
What one	If its higher or more raise the score	3.0
What one	The eight	3.0
Because its to the	Nearest tenth	3.0
So what would this be Dan	It would be six tenths	3.0
Okay explain to me what happened here	So on the first one we agreed and got one	1.0
So on the first one we agreed and got one	On the second one I got 06 he got 6	1.0
On the second one I got 06 he got 6	On the last one I got 059 and he got 09	1.0
What did you actually do	I rounded	3.0
So you rounded the eight to a nine because of the six but what did you forget	To leave the five	3.0
Is that what you did Mason	He got 09 or 009 he just didnt put the five	1.0
But Ive got to keep the numbers in front of it because if not I change the value of the number dont I	Mmhmm	0.0
Okay yes Maam	I have a question	2.0
I have a question	What would you rather us do it	2.0
What would you rather us do it	Would you rather us do 06 or just 6	2.0
I would like you to do zero point	Okay	0.0
Turn to math journal page		0.0
Do not do not do not do not do anything yet	We already did seven	0.0
We already did seven	Its 179	0.0
Its 179	Oh Im so good	0.0
Oh Im so good	Yeah we already did 177	0.0
I think Im on the wrong math lesson	Its 179	0.0
Just a second	Oh yeah its 179	0.0
Oh yeah its 179	Yeah Im always right	0.0
Why did you do 177	Its 58 were on 59 I think	0.0
Im on 59 in my book	Is this 177	0.0
What is your 177	Its 58	0.0
Its 58	58	0.0
Okay so my math thing is cray cray	Or our books are cray cray	0.0
59	That is odd	0.0
That is odd	Thats so weird	0.0
Thats okay Ill give you a piece of paper	Whats up	0.0
Whats up	My names	0.0
So they added something and didnt give us new Ts editions is what they did	We dont need these	0.0
Not yet	Thank you	0.0
Move	Okay are you ready	0.0
And Im going to ask Austin to start	Hello	0.0
First of all what problem are we solving	So were solving that that that that that	3.0
Is that plus or times	Are you judging me	0.0
Are you judging me	Yes I said	0.0
Yes I said	Okay so first weve got to split it into four	3.0
Okay so first weve got to split it into four	Split these into fours	3.0
So what way are you going to split it into fourths what way would you like to split it into fourths	This way	3.0
Okay so split it into fourths that way	With the who	0.0
With the who	Split it into fourths	3.0
Split it into fourths	Yeah but which way	2.0
Choose someone to go next	Thats what I said	0.0
Thats what I said	That is not what you said	0.0
Did they miss a step	You need to color in three	3.0
You need to color in three	You have to shade two fourths	3.0
Okay	Two	3.0
Two	And then we have to shade in two of those	3.0
And then we have to shade in two of those	And the answer is six ninths no six twelfths	3.0
And the answer is six ninths no six twelfths	Yeah six twelfths	1.0
Yeah six twelfths	But we have to	0.0
Now answer the question	Does that make sense where I did that	0.0
Using the boxes	Do you just put these in the corner	0.0
Do you just put these in the corner	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah but its	1.0
How many total boxes do we have there Austin	And then after that we can label them	0.0
And then after that we can label them		3.0
And how many of them are colored in both ways	Six	3.0
Im not sure what youre doing	What do we do when were done	0.0
Stand up	Stand up	0.0
Stand up	Is that right	0.0
Yep Im just looking to see if anybody did it differently	A little bit of PTSD	0.0
A little bit of PTSD	Yes thats perfect	0.0
Because she asked that question Im going to ask you to share	Do you know what PTSD stands for	0.0
Do you know what PTSD stands for	No its not	0.0
Why did you put three fourths down here and two thirds up here	What	0.0
What	You got more than me	0.0
No you did not do it backwards	I did it backward	0.0
I would like Mr Connor to come up here and model what he and Miss Alyssa talked about and did	Okay so what we did was we did the tick marks and then	4.0
Okay so what we did was we did the tick marks and then	And then after that we shaded in those	4.0
And then after that we shaded in those	We forgot to label	1.0
We forgot to label	And then after that we were	1.0
And then after that we were	And then we saw that six twelfths was how much	1.0
Miss Julia do you agree or disagree with what they did	I disagree with what they did	1.0
How come	Because they worked the problem backwards	4.0
Because they worked the problem backwards	They did the y coordinate first	4.0
So your first fraction is always what coordinate	Y	3.0
Your second one is the x	Oh wait no your first ones the x because the x	3.0
Because I wrote his name down the day we were wiping desks and he wasnt even one of my friends wiping desks	No he wrote it down because he wanted to tease it	0.0
Okay here we go	Can I be there	0.0
Yeah go ahead be up there together	So what me and Zach did was first we drew the fourth	3.0
So what me and Zach did was first we drew the fourth	You can kind of see in there	1.0
You can kind of see in there	In four and then we colored in three of them because its three fourths	4.0
In four and then we colored in three of them because its three fourths	And then we colored in the third this way and then we colored in two thirds	4.0
And then we colored in the third this way and then we colored in two thirds	And then the amount of them that were double shaded were three fourths	4.0
Was my problem two thirds times three fourths or was my problem three fourths times two thirds	We just changed that because of what we were saying	3.0
Yeah so youve got to make sure youre doing x and y	So we should have had the third going that way	3.0
It was three fourths should have been on the x coordinate and the two thirds should have been on the y coordinate	Isnt that what we did	3.0
Isnt that what we did	No	1.0
No	No x is on the bottom one	1.0
Because you have the thirds on the bottom and the fourths on the side	Oh	0.0
Is it ever going to change the outcome of the answer	No	0.0
Where are you going to end up	In the wrong place	3.0
Make sense	Yes	0.0
And friends on 180 it is going to ask you to	Ouch	0.0
Ouch	What is happening to my leg	0.0
What is happening to my leg	180	0.0
I want you to make sure whats the easiest one that youre going to write about	Multiply the denominator to the numerator	3.0
I want you to pick another one and demonstrate it on your other paper	Do you want us to just do all of them	0.0
And I want you to pick one of those to do on the paper	Wait how many of these	0.0
Wait how many of these	The second one	0.0
You know what a sage and scribe is right	Yes	0.0
Any questions	So on math boxes for example if I was odds and he was evens then I would only have one three and five written on mine and he would only have two and four	3.0
Yes	Can I have a pencil	0.0
Of course you may have a pencil	Do you need a sharpener	0.0
Do you need a sharpener	I have a sharpener	0.0
I have a sharpener	I have	0.0
Oh what size led do you need	Normal	0.0
Normal	I dont know normal	0.0
I dont know normal	07	0.0
Is it seven or five	I dont know were about to find out	0.0
It should be written right here	Oh I didnt see this	0.0
Alyssa thank you for sharing	In your own words first	0.0
In your own words first	Okay	0.0
Explain how you do those	You got games on your phone	0.0
You got games on your phone	You got games on your phone	0.0
You got games on your phone	So what do you do	0.0
So what do you do	One method we discussed in class	0.0
One method we discussed in class	One method we discussed in class was	0.0
Explain that to me	With folding paper	3.0
Tell me what weve learned in the last couple of days	Okay so then after youve solved these we have to pick two of them and do it on this paper	3.0
So what did I say to the class when I allowed them to use that demonstration	So we pick two of these we do one here and then we do one here	3.0
So what did Abi say was the easiest strategy	We have to solve all of these ones up here	3.0
Perfect and then what was my response on what I wanted you to do for number one	Thats a lot of things	0.0
Thats a lot of things	Lets change it	0.0
Can you tell me what you wrote for number one	I said For example  three sixth you multiply the denominator two times six equal 12 then you  numerators one times three equals three and then	4.0
What did you write	First what we do is multiply the denominator with the two fractions and then do the same with the numerator or you could do it with an area thing	4.0
Can I have your attention for just a minute	What	0.0
Haley	Yeah	0.0
Did you complete number one	What do you mean	0.0
Did you guys write something down for number one on journal page 178	We did	0.0
We did	Oh we are right now	0.0
Oh we are right now	Wait what	0.0
Wait what	Its 79	0.0
Can I ask what you are writing	Yes we are writing for the method for multiplying fractions discovered in class and were writing about paper folding	3.0
About the what	About the folding method	3.0
Go ahead Izzy	Because everybody knows how to do that and you want us to be able to understand how to do the other methods	4.0
Did I give specific instructions not to use that method on your paper or you could write it but there had to be an explanation of another	Yes	0.0
Were those my instructions	Yes	0.0
I needed that so good job thank you	So we would fold our papers into sixths	3.0
So we would fold our papers into sixths	The first fraction	1.0
The first fraction	The other way	1.0
The other way	First fraction denominator	1.0
First fraction denominator	I want to do it	0.0
How you doing friend	Good	0.0
Good	Its the answer	0.0
If when you get ready to do  and you only have to model one here and one here how are you going to solve the other one	Lets do two twelfths on this one	3.0
But if Ive only asked you to model two doing area model how could you do the rest	Multiplying them	3.0
You get to pick one and then you do that and youre going to sage and scribe these two yes	Wait you pick one of those three	0.0
Youre going to solve all three of them	Oh	0.0
But then youre only going to model one of them over here	Oh	0.0
Okay	Im going to circle the ones at the bottom	0.0
Im going to circle the ones at the bottom	Okay now we have to explain this	0.0
Im going to ask you the same thing	So they kind of challenge you	3.0
Why do you think thats going to challenge you	Because its big numbers	4.0
Okay so you have to break it into bigger pieces	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No thats too hard	0.0
You did not explain how this shows your thinking	Oh I chose that one that we could write	0.0
Oh I chose that one that we could write	There you go	0.0
There you go	Okay now what shall we do next	2.0
Okay now what shall we do next	What do you think we should do next	2.0
What do you think we should do next	After we solve it	1.0
After we solve it	And what do we shade it into	2.0
And what do we shade it into	Whats the six that we have to shade to	2.0
Whats the six that we have to shade to	Oh	0.0
Oh	And then what do we have to do next	2.0
He just asked you a question	Its from one half to three sixth	3.0
Its from one half to three sixth	Does that make sense	1.0
Does that make sense	Yeah yeah	0.0
Yeah yeah	Does that make sense	1.0
Okay	My hand is getting all	0.0
Oh would you do StMaP for me	Yeah	0.0
Play StMaP	We need help	2.0
We need help	This one is subtraction and  common denominator is that the right thing to do	3.0
Yeah	We werent sure if	0.0
We werent sure if	So we picked this one to shade all this in but how would we do that	2.0
You will have to use a different model	Well then we will pick a different one	0.0
Remember how Do you have a whiteboard that I can show you	I do and I have it ready right here	0.0
Tell me what the problem is	It is three fourths minus one	0.0
Three fourths minus one third	Yeah	0.0
What tool would I have to use	Fraction circle	3.0
And Im going to try and solve that with a box	Okay	0.0
That was three fourths times	What about if we do number 10	0.0
What about if we do number 10	Because then we can find the area	4.0
Because then we can find the area	Thats what weve been doing	1.0
Thats what weve been doing	Really	1.0
Really	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	The area	1.0
The area	Its six fifteenths	1.0
Its six fifteenths	She said to do it	0.0
Yes in just a minute	Weve got to do number 10	0.0
You can put on Mozart if you would like	Your labeling is fine just fix your tick marks	0.0
What does it mean to interpret	To show	3.0
What do you think	Like kind of break it down and find it out	3.0
All right were not going to summarize anything today	Oh  too	0.0
Were going to skip the first part of this okay	Thats great	0.0
	Draw a picture  piece of paper to help you	0.0
I just need the  here	I already know the answer	0.0
I already know the answer	pick me	0.0
Yes maam	Can we draw a picture of a folded piece of paper	0.0
Well thats what you would be doing	okay	0.0
Go	Do you want us to use tick marks	0.0
When you have completed both of them I will ask you to stand please	how is	0.0
I want both problems solved	I dont really	0.0
I would like your tick marks to show your understanding of coordinates too	The fourth	3.0

You are welcome	So its  a pattern that  so	3.0
Is there something that I can help you with	yeah	0.0
Youre working on math boxes alone and then you will work with your new partner	Busted	0.0
Hey what are you confused about guys	So	0.0
So read me the problem	I just have this	0.0
I just have this	I think were making it	0.0
I think were making it	explain how you use the picture to solve the problem	0.0
How did you use that picture	So  I got 10 to the power of	3.0
Okay	And  I got 10 to the power of nine	3.0
And  I got 10 to the power of nine	number two	3.0
So how did you come up with	The first one	0.0
Because	So I put that	0.0
If group A took 12 twelfths of the casserole	okay	0.0
Thats not what the pictures telling me here is it	and then we add the	3.0
Okay how much does it  that group A took	Oh yeah and then  add it which I brought	3.0
How much is left over	three times two	3.0
I cant do 12 twelfths because group A did not take 12 twelfths	it would be eighttwelfths	3.0
Yes	Yeah I know it does but the  plus three	4.0
Yeah I know it does but the  plus three	So two plus three is five and	4.0
Yes	Okay so do you know the order that you do the	0.0
Im trying to give you something that you can just look at	But thats what I say so that	0.0
But thats what I say so that	Oh PEMDAS	3.0
PEMDAS its Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally so parentheses	Exponents	3.0
Exponents	Multiplication division and then addition and subtraction	3.0
Sorry I knew what it was but I was afraid that you wouldnt so PEMDAS	Yeah yeah	0.0
Of course as soon as you said it I found it	I can  it	0.0
Yeah	So on this one	0.0
So on this one	Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally	3.0
Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally	That  or that	0.0
So how did we do that	Because on our sheets of paper its like a fraction times a fraction	4.0
So if Im doing a fraction of a whole am I going to come out with a whole number	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No	1.0
No	Or yeah yeah	1.0
If Im doing a whole number of a fraction am I going to come out with a fraction or a whole number	Fraction	3.0
Fraction	Fraction	1.0
Yes sir	I know its like  number but I dont know what the password is	0.0
Okay	Do you want this back	0.0
So Im going to ask was this interpreting a model	Yeah yeah	0.0
What did he start with	Three fourths	3.0
And what did he eat	Half	3.0
Go ahead	I dont really know but I think maybe say a sword instead of a magic wand maybe real world stuff I think	3.0
Would you share a pizza	Mmhmm	0.0
Mmhmm	Yeah	1.0
Would you carpet a room	No	0.0
Would you buy cookies to share	Yes	0.0
Yes	Yeah	1.0
Would you figure out how much paint youd need to cover a room	No	0.0
No	Yes	1.0
Greater than leS than equal to	Greater than	3.0
What happens when you multiply a number by one	What	0.0
What happens when you multiply a number by one	Oh	0.0
Is it going to change	No	0.0
Three fourths times three is it greater than leS than or equal too three fourths	I said greater than	3.0
How come	Because oh	0.0
Go ahead and phone a friend please	I said equal to because three is a whole number so youre just making three fourths into more three fourths	4.0
I said equal to because three is a whole number so youre just making three fourths into more three fourths	I dont know how to explain this	2.0
What do you think	I think you do three fourths times three and so you do three times three because the three is the numerator and so it would be nine fourths	4.0
so help explain where Michaels going who can add to that	Well you got the first part right but then you	1.0
What part did he get right	The three times three	1.0
The three times three	Yes but after that you had to do three times four because whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom	4.0
Yes but after that you had to do three times four because whatever you do to the top you have to do to the bottom	And three times four is twelve	4.0
And three times four is twelve	So it would be nine over twelve	4.0
Do we agree with that or disagree	Agree	1.0
Okay Gage can you explain the next one	I said equal to because anything times one is just what it was	4.0
Do we agree with that	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Yeah	1.0
Anything we multiply by one	Is the same number	3.0
All right and now Im going to do Abby is not here James the last one is three fourths times one half great than leS than or equal too	I said leS than because three times one is three and	4.0
So you said Im sorry did you say greater than leS than or equal too	LeS than	3.0
Okay so three fourths times one half is leS than three fourths do we agree with that	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yeah	1.0
All righty my loves here we go on to the next thing	Already	0.0
Write at least three down on your whiteboard and then stand up	I dont know	2.0

Oh	Okay	0.0
Okay you have three minutes that gives each person in the group time to speak so three minutes and go	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I said that	0.0
Okay when your group is done please return to your seat thank your partner and go	Thank you	0.0
Go	We talked about when you redo your floors or carpets and you have to figure out what the area of the ground there is so that it fits	3.0
What did you guys say	What we talked about was say youre doing your homework and you maybe need to use multiplication division and yeah	3.0
Dan	What we talked about was when you buy two or more things at the store when you buy multiple things you can just times it by two or how many youre getting	3.0
So	Thats what I said	0.0
MiS Isaac you are up	No thats Ben	0.0
My brain is	When youre doing homework and youll have to do multiplication	3.0
Well thats pretty easy I know I have one miSing and I should be able to do equal groups of two	But we	0.0
Volume and comparing amount of measurements so if a child is three feet tall and her father is two times taller her fathers what	Six foot	3.0
Exactly	Six feet is	0.0
Okay	No its not because	0.0
So now	Shes pretty short	0.0
Shes pretty short	Shes that tall	0.0
Shes that tall	Shes this tall	0.0
Shes this tall	The size of my foot is	0.0
Okay so we talked about all of the ways we would solve	Thats like eight feet then	0.0
Oh I know what I need to do I would like you and your partner are we ready	Yes maam	0.0
Yes maam	Yes	0.0
It has to equal one of those	Or can we use seven eight and To make 56 because seven times eight	4.0
Everyone should be participating	Okay	0.0
Okay	Okay so what I think we can write I thought we could do	0.0
Okay go ahead	So if you were at a supermarket	3.0
Talk it out before you write it	Say if you were in a supermarket and you bought  Bananas cost up to like  and each banana  Seven times eight equals 56	4.0
Say if you were in a supermarket and you bought  Bananas cost up to like  and each banana  Seven times eight equals 56	Eight by seven	1.0
Eight by seven	How do you spell	0.0
Thats okay	So he scored seven points	3.0
So he scored seven points	Equals 56	3.0
Thank you	Oh thats so easy to read read it	0.0
Oh thats so easy to read read it	What how	0.0
What how	Look watch	0.0
Look watch	Im getting my bs and ds mixed up again	0.0
When your group is done please have a seat on the ground wherever youre at just have a seat	Sit on the ground not on a chair	0.0
Connor Connor Connor Connor	Do we stay with our partners or go back	0.0
Go to a zero	We said in the food drive someone drops off seven boxes of cans and theres eight cans in each box	3.0
We said in the food drive someone drops off seven boxes of cans and theres eight cans in each box	How many cans in total	3.0
Number story	Yes	1.0
Connor tell me why	Why thats a number story is because theres seven cans no theres seven boxes and then theres eight cans in each one	4.0
Why thats a number story is because theres seven cans no theres seven boxes and then theres eight cans in each one	So if you count it all it does equal 56	4.0
Okay Ben and James please read yours	Okay	0.0
The way it is written gentlemen	What we said was John went to the store and bought seven bananas and each banana cost 8 then he went to the checkout and got a grand total of 56	4.0
Okay is that a number story yes or no	No	1.0
Do you need to ask for help in your group	Yeah	0.0
Go ahead	We said John went golfing and he scored seven points on eight holes	3.0
We said John went golfing and he scored seven points on eight holes	How many points did he get	3.0
Like that means he didnt even have to get a point on one	Yeah he didnt	3.0
Okay Im going to come right back here	I said Jimmy Jonathon has seven feet of fence one way and eight on the other how much area of fencing does he have in total	3.0
Do we agree that he used the correct vocabulary	No	1.0
John why are you saying no	Because he didnt use area	4.0
Because he didnt use area	I said how much area of fencing does he have in total	1.0
I said how much area of fencing does he have in total	Hey Matt can you read the question	1.0
Read the question again Matt	Jimmy Jonathon feet of fencing one way and eight feet the other way how much area of fencing does he have in total	3.0
Go ahead	You shouldve said instead of one way and another way you shouldve said width and length	1.0
Agreed	Yes	1.0
Go ahead youre up	Okay we said our room is eight feet long eight by one and the carpet we want is two feet long and four times two equals eight so we need to get four pieces to cover it	3.0
Okay do they have a number story yes or no	No	1.0
Why not Austin	Because they gave the answer	4.0
They gave the answer	And they didnt use a question	1.0
Matt did you want to add to it	She said we she didnt give a specific person in her number story but I think thats okay	3.0
Go ahead Dan and Emily	Okay	0.0
Please tell me you didnt change something because you heard other people	No	0.0
Okay because I want exactly what you wrote	So I said we said	0.0
We said	and Emma are going around the town to sell cookies	4.0
and Emma are going around the town to sell cookies	They have 100 cookies and they need to have 56 left over	4.0
They have 100 cookies and they need to have 56 left over	And then we said to get 56 cookies they need to sell 44 cookies	4.0
First of all Im going to ask is that a multiplication story problem	No	1.0
No what type of problem is it everyone	Subtraction	1.0
Okay	We added	3.0
We added	No because you did 56	4.0
No because you did 56	Oh wait no	1.0
And was there a question in there	No	1.0
Go ahead next up	So we wrote one day I was fitting new carpet in my bedroom the length was seven feet and the width was eight feet	3.0
So we wrote one day I was fitting new carpet in my bedroom the length was seven feet and the width was eight feet	I know I had to multiply the length by the width to find out how much carpet we need today	3.0
I know I had to multiply the length by the width to find out how much carpet we need today	How much carpet do we need	3.0
How much carpet do we need	Oh that was great	1.0
It had the proper what is the vword	Vocabulary	3.0
And it had the proper mathematical	Equation	3.0
Okay over here	Vocabulary	0.0
Vocabulary	So we are getting a carpet and we need eight feet for our length and seven feet for our width and then we have to multiply eight by seven so how much feet of carpet do we need	3.0
How much feet of carpet do we need		3.0
We agree	Yeah	1.0
Is it how much feet of carpet do I need or how many feet of carpet do I need	How many feet	3.0
How much does something cost how many of it do I need	Oh	0.0
Oh	Yeah	0.0
Go ahead	Okay	0.0
Okay	has seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have	3.0
Seven boxes of eight tiles how many tiles does he have all together everybody		3.0
Here we go	Lets go	0.0
When your group is done stand up	its six because three times three is nine	4.0
its six because three times three is nine	Or is it 12	1.0
Or is it 12	Hold on	0.0
Hold on	Because nine divided by three is three and then three times two is six	4.0
I want you to be able after you solve it to answer all of these questions	Thats a lot of questions	0.0
Thats a lot of questions		3.0
Gentlemen you have to able to answer all those questions so stay seated until youve got them done	Can we move up	0.0
Can we move up	We cant see them	0.0
You may move right here	Bro theres too much questions though	0.0
Bro theres too much questions though	Two thirds	3.0
You know how to solve these	Nine divided by	0.0
Okay	So what mathematical	0.0
Well you have the number model so what operation did you use	Oh	0.0
Are we working on division or multiplication in order to be able to meet our succeS criterions	because two times two is six	4.0
Your learning objective is to multiply	Because six will technically be our equivalent because three times two is six	4.0
Thats what its asking is greater than leS than or equal too	Okay so	0.0
Okay so	Yes itll be equal to each other yes	3.0
Yes itll be equal to each other yes	Yeah	1.0
Yeah	Itll be equal	1.0
Itll be equal	It wouldnt be equal because six	4.0
It wouldnt be equal because six	Two thirds is smaller	1.0
Okay buddy go ahead	First you put nine times  and then we divided it by three and then we got three	4.0
First you put nine times  and then we divided it by three and then we got three	And then you get three times two equals six	4.0
Okay but did you answer the questions of is it greater than leS than did you do any of those	Yes	0.0
Yes	Greater than	3.0
And then yes it is greater than two thirds	Yeah	0.0
Go ahead Ben	Okay so	0.0
Okay so	We knew it would be bigger than nine because two times three which is six and three times three is nine	4.0
We knew it would be bigger than nine because two times three which is six and three times three is nine	So then he spent 6 on comics so it will be equal to the two thirds because it is a total to six ninths and it would be leS than nine because youre multiplying by two thirds	4.0
Why did you do that	Because	0.0
Because	I dont know	2.0
I dont know	I see what youre saying	0.0
Because you are absolutely right but Im asking you to explain this part of your conceptual understanding of it	Because I knew that it was supposed to be equal to nine two thirds if nine is	4.0
You are doing a great job	And then I knew that two times three was six and	4.0
Kate can you add to that	I wrote it a little bit different I did	1.0
And Ben you are exactly correct I needed to check on a couple of things	So I wrote here I did one third times nine because its 9 to get three and then six is two thirds of nine then I did the two thirds times nine and the three times two is six	4.0
What made you do that	Because I just find it easier first to figure it out without the two thirds so I just made it one third and then multiply it by two	4.0
What did you get out of what they just said	I dont know	2.0
Why	Because	0.0
Does Adams way of doing this work	Yes	1.0
Yes	Yeah	1.0

And that its two thirds and four fifths	Four times  Thats the ones we count	3.0
How do you know that	Three fourths colored in on all of these and there is 10 squares and there is three colored in and so three times 10 equals	3.0
Everybody needs to explain it not just one person in the group	30	3.0

All right so we just got to use one	Here it is	1.0
So whats six divided by three	Two	3.0
And whats two times two	Okay that makes more sense	0.0
James the strategy I have for you is two I wish I was as good as all of you that come up with different strategies Im not that good	and this one	0.0

We have to write about	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	No lets use that one	0.0
No lets use that one	One and seven	3.0

Yesterday we talked about movements multiplying decimals by powers of 10 and when we are multiplying we move the decimal to right	Right	0.0
And when we are dividing we move the decimal to the	Left	3.0
And when we move it to the left	The number gets smaller	3.0
All right so we dont need that one	So are we going to be doing powers of 10 for the past week	0.0
So youre going to write one greater than one and three tenths and youre going to write one less than  one and three tenths	It doesnt matter what it is	0.0
It doesnt matter what it is	Just any	0.0
Ms Julia Im going to ask you to explain the strategy you used to solve this math problem message	So the strategy I used is I made a grid where the number that Im doing is in the middle and then the less and greater than	4.0
So the strategy I used is I made a grid where the number that Im doing is in the middle and then the less and greater than	So the strategy I used is I put the greater than on one side and then the less than on the other and for the greater than I moved the point to the right and for the less than I moved the point to the left	4.0
Did she use what we learned yesterday	Yes	1.0
Was it difficult to think about that	No	0.0
If I need something greater than move the decimal one point to the	Right	0.0
And if I need it less than I move the decimal one point to the	Left	3.0
So much easier moving to the right or the left isnt it	Yes	0.0
Least to greatest	Do we put the answer or just the problem	0.0
Are your lights on on that	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	Oh no theyre not	0.0
That red light is blinking next to the window	It blinks when it records	0.0
It blinks when it records	Yeah the red light means its recording	0.0
to come  up here and Im going to ask you to share what you did and explain why you did it	Okay	0.0
Okay	So I did least here and greatest up there and I did four divided by 10 to the power of three first and then three divided by 10 to the power of four and then four divided by 10 to the power of three and then three divided by sorry times 10 to the power of four	4.0
Explain why you did that	Well I did the  times up here because I know that when you times something  it gets greater then when you divide it gets smaller	4.0
Well I did the  times up here because I know that when you times something  it gets greater then when you divide it gets smaller	And I know when you divide something by	4.0
And I know when you divide something by	I think I got those two wrong	3.0
I think I got those two wrong	When you divide something by a higher number 10 to the power of four then it means it will get smaller	4.0
When you divide something by a higher number 10 to the power of four then it means it will get smaller	And when you divide something by 10 to the power of three it will be bigger than this because it well youre dividing it by a  greater number	4.0
And when you divide something by 10 to the power of three it will be bigger than this because it well youre dividing it by a  greater number	And then for this one four times 10 to the power of three I know that there will be three zeroes on it so it will be 4000	4.0
And then for this one four times 10 to the power of three I know that there will be three zeroes on it so it will be 4000	And then for this one there will be four zeroes on it so it will be 30000	4.0
Go ahead	So I solved them first and then put them in order because I wasnt  sure about them	4.0
So I solved them first and then put them in order because I wasnt  sure about them	I knew that the multiplication ones would be bigger because dividing makes it a smaller number and multiplying makes it bigger	4.0
I knew that the multiplication ones would be bigger because dividing makes it a smaller number and multiplying makes it bigger	So I first solved the multiplication and I got 4000 for the four times 10 to the power of three and I got 30000 for three times 10 to the power of four	4.0
So I first solved the multiplication and I got 4000 for the four times 10 to the power of three and I got 30000 for three times 10 to the power of four	And  then 30000 is greater than 4000 so I did 30000 first and then 4000	4.0
And  then 30000 is greater than 4000 so I did 30000 first and then 4000	Then I did the division problems and I knew what I do for dividing is say it was like four divided by 10 to the power of three	4.0
Then I did the division problems and I knew what I do for dividing is say it was like four divided by 10 to the power of three	I would write down the zero right there since if youre dividing with decimals or whatever it takes away one of those zeroes	4.0
I would write down the zero right there since if youre dividing with decimals or whatever it takes away one of those zeroes	So then I  and I put a decimal there and then I put the other zeroes that I hadnt used yet there and then I put	4.0
All  right so should you put the decimal point when Im talking about three divided by 10 to the power of four where does my decimal point start	At the beginning	3.0
What do you mean at the beginning	Well the decimal point starts at the very the first number	3.0
So it would have been point three	No	0.0
What would it have been	What do you mean	2.0
Where does the decimal go when you get ready to solve these	The decimal is the first thing you write down	3.0
Okay so if Im doing is it three divided by 10  to the power of what	Four	3.0
Thats what youre telling me	No	0.0
What should it be	It should just be two because	3.0
What do I need to do	Add the zero	3.0
You and I still have the same things dont we	Mmhmm	0.0
And by showing her that do you understand  why you did it wrong	Mmhmm	0.0
It should have been three divided by 10 to the power of	Four	3.0
I want you to tell me what expression of those is going to be the largest	I think the largest one is going to be 15  times 10 to the power of two	3.0
Why do you say that	Because its multiplication and multiplication makes the number bigger	4.0
Do you all understand that	Yes	0.0
Did I have to solve that to look at it to figure it out	No	0.0
What way am I moving my decimal	To the right	3.0
What  is my number		3.0
Thats 10 20 30 and Im going to do	I understand this game now	0.0
Im moving it to	To the right	3.0
To the right for 120	Three times	3.0
Three times	Moving three times	3.0
I know Im going 30	Its 10 to the power of	3.0
Do you see how to play this	Yes	0.0
But I want to make sure were doing what were supposed to be doing and understanding it	Jonathan	0.0
Austin who do you want to play with	Matt	0.0
Until you actually score a touchdown you do not have a score	What is this	0.0
Did you do that	Yes	0.0
Totally 100	Kind of	0.0
Would you agree with that	Yes	0.0
Please get out your whiteboards dry erase markers	May I have a dry erase marker	0.0
May I  see your answers real quick	I didnt get that	0.0
Tell me how you did that	So I do that it was over	0.0
Okay	I knew that fivethirds is  because five is	4.0
How many threes sets of three can I make out of five	One	3.0
And how many do you have left over	Two	3.0
What shouldnt change	The denominator	3.0
So what is your answer	One and  twothirds	3.0
Mr John	Uhhuh	0.0
Can you talk us through teaching her	So first what I did is I looked at the fives  then I seen that there was one whole	4.0
So first what I did is I looked at the fives  then I seen that there was one whole	So I did five times one and five times one equals five	4.0
So I did five times one and five times one equals five	Then I did five plus four which equals nine	4.0
Then I did five plus four which equals nine	So I got ninefifths	4.0
Denominator times the whole plus the numerator	Okay	0.0
And you are absolutely 100 right	I knew that four times five is 20 and then I knew that there was one remaining so it would be four and onefifth	4.0
Same way	So you can do it backwards	3.0
Strathom Strathom Strathom	Strathom Strathom Strathom	0.0
Strathom Strathom Strathom	Come on Miss Strathom	0.0
Come on Miss Strathom	Miss Strathom	0.0
Miss Strathom	Youd think on the last days of school	0.0
Youd think on the last days of school	Okay	0.0
Could it be what you did	Yeah	0.0
What did you write	I just did nine	3.0
I just did nine	I was just explaining it to them	1.0
I was just explaining it to them	And then one times three is	1.0
Okay go ahead	Yeah	0.0
Yeah	I got 33eighths	3.0
About 33eighths	I did the same thing but instead I just take away one	1.0
I did the same thing but instead I just take away one	I got 23tenths	3.0
I got 23tenths	Yep	1.0
Yep	We all have	0.0
We all have	The glasses are fogging up	0.0
The glasses are fogging up	I know	0.0
And we got rid of Ts because shes too tall with her shoes on	Wait five foot two	3.0
Wait five foot two	She said four foot two	1.0
Guys I dont believe its in its not in your math journal	No its not	0.0
Then Im going to have you	Do we have to say how much shorter he is or just shorter	2.0
Nope	Do we divide by 12	3.0
Do we divide by 12	How many inches  is it	2.0
Is the orangutan  taller or shorter than a fifth grader	So the shortest is four foot two	3.0
Four foot two	Four foot two	0.0
Austin whey do you think the orangutan is larger	Because there are still some people that are taller than   There is one that is still four foot five	4.0
Whats 12 times four		3.0
Plus five	53	3.0
53	54	3.0
So our shorter person is 54 inches	What	0.0
What	No 53 inches	3.0
Or 53 inches	Hes smaller	3.0
58 inches tall	Wait so is it you or the shortest person	2.0
May I see what you wrote please	Mmhmm	0.0
Tell me why you think that	Since you said the smallest length of kid in our class was four foot five I thought  53 inches and you said the orangutan was 58 inches which is bigger	4.0
Dan explain your thinking please	Because didnt you say he was  48 inches	4.0
I said he was 58 inches	You said 48 the first time you said it	3.0
You said 48 the first time you said it	Yeah but then you corrected	1.0
But then I corrected myself	And you had	0.0
So were you basing this off those of you that said hes shorter were you basing it off the 48 or the 58		3.0
Zach	Convert feet into inches	3.0
Convert feet into inches	Or inches into feet	3.0
Haley	You need to look at the data sheet	3.0
You need to look at the data sheet	Because most of them are four eight and this orangutan is four ten	4.0
Because most of them are four eight and this orangutan is four ten	And most of the fifth graders are four eight or four  nine and not four ten and higher	4.0
So what was our vocabulary word	Data point	3.0
What do you think	By looking at the data of the set	3.0
Anna	I would most the majority part like how many people had that one	3.0
How do I get to the majority do you think	Do we get which one has the most exes or	3.0
So it tells me when I posed the question to you the first time it was very easy to figure out right	Yeah	0.0
What  could we do to even out the heights of the towers	So to even out the heights	3.0
Jaden explain to me what you and your partner talked about	We talked about how were going to even the tower out by take one block from the taller one and giving it to the smaller one so theyre the same size	3.0
Mathematically what did I just do	Something with data points	3.0
Julia	Did you do wait you want it in a number sentence	0.0
Tell me mathematically what I did	No	0.0
Whats five minus three	Two	3.0
Agree or disagree	I disagree	1.0
Okay tell me mathematically what I did	You would take five and then do five minus one to make it four	4.0
You would take five and then do five minus one to make it four	Then three plus one to make that four	4.0
Austin tell me what I need to do	To get equal towers	3.0
But  why do I have to subtract anything	Because youre taking a layer from the one with five turning it	4.0
I moved it but now I want to know how to do it without taking it away	Do you add things	3.0
I did attach it	Then three  plus two to make five	4.0
Then three  plus two to make five	And then theyre both five	4.0
Okay	So when you get two people that are the same height as whatever the three is and then you	3.0
Okay	You add five plus three	3.0
Oh why do I add five plus three	Because I dont know that what it looks like you do	2.0
Whats five plus three	Eight	3.0
And whats eight divided by two	Four	3.0
Is that how I would get a data point	Yes	0.0
53 54 56 57 59 60 61 62	What does that mean	2.0
You and your partner	You skipped one	0.0
You skipped one	The one there	0.0
Go	So for this data hes 58	3.0
So for this data hes 58	Add 53 to 54  I think what were doing is so we have 58 so if we  we could see the wholes of 57 and 59 and see whats in between	4.0
Add 53 to 54  I think what were doing is so we have 58 so if we  we could see the wholes of 57 and 59 and see whats in between	We add them	4.0
We add them	No maybe we add something to get 58	4.0
No maybe we add something to get 58	Out of those	4.0
Out of those	We could do 53 plus 55 which would make it 108 minus 50 to make it 58	4.0
We could do 53 plus 55 which would make it 108 minus 50 to make it 58	But we dont have just 50	1.0
But we dont have just 50	So what hang on what if we just did  50	1.0
So what hang on what if we just did  50	To get 58  what you could do is 53 plus 55 to get us to 108	4.0
To get 58  what you could do is 53 plus 55 to get us to 108	And 108 minus 50 equals 58	4.0
And 108 minus 50 equals 58	We dont have 50	1.0
We dont have 50	just take the 50 away	1.0
just take the 50 away	Not so  exactly	1.0
Not so  exactly	The orangutan is 58	1.0
The orangutan is 58	So if the orangutan is this okay so the orangutan is 58 inches	1.0
So if the orangutan is this okay so the orangutan is 58 inches	No	1.0
No	If we do this	0.0
John tell me what you and your partner did	We did  four plus two divided it by 2	4.0
Where did you get four and two	We got it from 57 and 59	3.0
You did the four 59s  and what	And the two 50s	3.0
And the two 59s	The four 57s and the two 54s	3.0
Why did you did I only do six Ss	No	0.0
Tell me you said Im very confused	I am very confused	2.0
I am very confused	I dont know	0.0
What is Zach explain to me what Zach is doing	So I think hes adding all of them together arent you	2.0
All of what together Zach	All of the measurements and then Im going to divide that by one two three four five six seven eight nine	3.0
So when you say youre adding them all together are you just doing 53 54 55 56 57 59 60 61 62	No Im adding each because you already told me what each  sticky note is worth by adding	4.0
So what is this number that you would add right here		3.0
This ones a little harder	I have that somewhere but I dont	0.0
So its 56 times what	Seven	3.0
Seven	Which would be 656	4.0
	Yep	0.0
So can I just pick two data points	Nope	0.0
Zach is just about done so Im going to ask him what his answer is	Im not done yet	0.0
Im not done yet	Im doing the dividing right now	0.0
Okay	He says 1245 divided by nine	3.0
1200 and what	45 divided by nine	3.0
Now what do I have to do with that 138 friends	Divide it by two	3.0
Why would I divide it by two	Divide it by twenty	3.0
How many inches are in a foot		3.0
	So then you would divide that by 12 to get how many to get your inches	4.0
So then you would divide that by 12 to get how many to get your inches	And then you would add on the threeninths inches	4.0
So if its 138 is the average the data point our orangutan is what		3.0
	Smaller	3.0
Or no I mean nine people that I measured yesterday Zach	Yeah because theres only nine measurements	4.0
How many people did I measure		3.0
Because I took all of their measurements	Oh because its not nine groups its 21	4.0
Oh because its not nine groups its 21	Oh	0.0
Its 21 total people	I was dividing it by  nine too	3.0
So now if I do 1245 and how many did I say we had		3.0
How many times does 21 go into 124	21 times21 times five	3.0
21 times21 times five	Five  times	1.0
Why five	Because its 101 and thats as close as you can get	4.0
Because its 101 and thats as close as you can get	No itll be six	1.0
And then it got into 235 how many times		3.0
	No nine	3.0
No nine	Seven	3.0
Oh wait no I did it right	Its 105	3.0
Its 105	No it would be 10	1.0
Its not our average height is it	Wouldnt it be 105	3.0
Wouldnt it be 105	This is confuzzling	2.0
This is confuzzling	Not 101	1.0
Not 101	Wouldnt it be 11 then	1.0
Wouldnt it be 11 then	Five times 21	1.0
How many times does 21 go into 195	Three times	3.0
Three times	Four no four	3.0
Uhhuh	Its seven	3.0
Its seven	Itd be 84 right	1.0
Itd be 84 right	Its eight	1.0
Its eight	Oh 195	1.0
Nine would be 198 or 99	Its eight	3.0
So it only goes into it eight times		3.0
Okay	Its 168	3.0
Our orangutan was how tall		3.0
Is he smaller or bigger	Smaller  by seven inches	3.0
So	Point twoseven	3.0
Point twoseven	Hes two point	1.0
Is finding a data point lickitysplit easy	No	0.0
Yes each percent is their own group	Im still very confused	2.0
And then I have to  divide them by every single person that was in the data group	That makes sense now	0.0
Nine five and three	Add them together	3.0
What did I get Ethan when I added them together	Nine plus five 14	4.0
Nine plus five 14		4.0
17 divided by what	Three	3.0
Whats 17 divided by three	Eight and one seventeenth	3.0
17 divided by three	Its five	3.0
Five what	Five and threeseventeenths	3.0
Five and threeseventeenths	Five and twoseventeenths	1.0
Five and twoseventeenths	Five and oneseventeenth	1.0
Five and oneseventeenth	No because that three times five is 15 and you would add	4.0
Five remainder two	Oh so we use remainders not fractions	3.0
Makes sense	Yeah	0.0
You are going to  look at page 208	The one that has the line graph	0.0
I want the	Which ones do you want us to answer the questions to	0.0
Which ones do you want us to answer the questions to	Which ones are you wanting the questions to	0.0
What is the	So  you only do one animal	0.0
So this one everybody what is it	Emperors penguin heights	3.0
In what	Inches	3.0
What is this one	Chimpanzee heights in inches	3.0
Chimpanzee heights in inches	Red kangaroo heights in inches	1.0
What is the height of the smallest red kangaroo represented on the plot line everybody	48 and a half inches	3.0
How do you know	Because  the lowest X and its between 48 and 49	4.0
How many are there	Three	3.0
Stand when youve got an answer	Just exes	0.0
Go	So what did was I did 60 plus 60	3.0
Thank you Andrew	Plus another 60 which gives me 180	4.0
Plus another 60 which gives me 180	Then I added the half  then I did 120 plus 61  sorry can you turn  and then I added half	4.0
Okay please return  to your seats after you are done explaining	And then 180 plus  why did you just  because youre adding all	4.0
And what you didnt understand	I was thinking but now that Im saying it	0.0
What were you thinking	I just didnt know if you were supposed to multiply it but now I do so its	3.0
What did I multiple		3.0
Times what	Times seven	3.0
Times seven	Times the exes	3.0
So if you multiply 60 times three what would you have gotten		4.0
	But you still have three  left and two  so its 181 but you still have lots of	4.0
Are your misconceptions about how to do that different now	Yeah	0.0
Thank you	I think  were looking at  should we sit down	0.0
Would they be taller or shorter than a fifth grader	They would be taller  itd be shorter  I  think theyd be shorter  I think its be shorter because the average fifth grader is 58 inches and that is 52 and 47	4.0
Youre defending	So what do you guys think	2.0
Okay when you and your partner have an answer go ahead and take a knee	Are we only doing	0.0
Emily your group needs to go first	Ill talk	0.0
Go ahead	I said I think they would be shorter because the average fifth grader is 58 inches and the chimpanzee is 52 and the red kangaroo is 47	4.0
Connor explain your thinking	So I thought they were	0.0
Go ahead John	We believe that itll be taller because 52 plus 63 inches is going to be taller than 52 inches and then you add 58 more because	4.0
Jaden	We think it would be taller	3.0
Oh Im sorry you and John were working together werent you	No me and Jonathan	0.0
Why do you think its taller	Because you have to add 52 plus 63 plus 40	4.0
Because you have to add 52 plus 63 plus 40	Then itll be taller	4.0
What have you guys think	We think for the emperor penguin we thought it would be bigger  I mean smaller because there was the most on 52 but we were kind of confused	4.0
What do you guys think	We think that the red kangaroo is shorter and then the chimpanzees taller	3.0
Okay	We thought they were all smaller because on the chimpanzee height theres less  people although theres 63 theres less people	4.0
We thought they were all smaller because on the chimpanzee height theres less  people although theres 63 theres less people	And then for the red kangaroo we thought it was less because that one was 58 and theres only one more person then theres 58	4.0
And then for the red kangaroo we thought it was less because that one was 58 and theres only one more person then theres 58	And then for the emperor penguins we said it was smaller because it has the same amount  at 52	4.0
Okay	Us	0.0
Us	Okay	0.0
Okay	We thought that all of them would be shorter except the chimpanzee because it goes to 63 and ours  only goes to 52	4.0
We thought that all of them would be shorter except the chimpanzee because it goes to 63 and ours  only goes to 52	And the emperor penguins only go to 52	4.0
And the emperor penguins only go to 52	And the red kangaroo only goes to 58	4.0
What do you guys think	We thought it would be taller because	3.0
What do you guys think	We said that the emperors penguin would be shorter the chimpanzee would be taller and the kangaroo would be shorter	3.0
So now guess what	What	0.0
Okay	Who has to write it all down	0.0
Go	this is 82 and a half  80 times by   all the measurements plus 43 which will be 86	4.0
this is 82 and a half  80 times by   all the measurements plus 43 which will be 86	82 plus 86 equals 168	4.0
82 plus 86 equals 168		1.0
	168 is  and then we go on to  46 and a half  92 93	4.0
168 is  and then we go on to  46 and a half  92 93	Then 46 that would be 93 and a half	4.0
Then 46 that would be 93 and a half	and then 47 and a half	4.0
Good job	96 I just made it 96	3.0
96 I just made it 96	104 26  no youre right	1.0
104 26  no youre right	You are right	1.0
You are right	and that would be 80 98	1.0
Im sorry honey	I did 38 and a half plus 52 and a half	3.0
Good thinking thank you for explaining your thinking	Oh no this is going to be hard  three plus two equal five	4.0
Oh no this is going to be hard  three plus two equal five	and a half	1.0
and a half	Add  there thats seven and nine	1.0
Add  there thats seven and nine	I got 697	1.0
You need to add those together	585 plus 49 ad 170 is No wait	3.0
Is  Dan adding these numbers or are you doing all the work here	I got 1008	3.0
Okay go	93 plus 81  1008 and divide it by Im not very good at divisions divide it by what	2.0
Oh youre doing 49  that is easier to add those	And then I add	3.0
Okay	So I am multiplying but the process	3.0
Okay	Oh my god	0.0
Oh my god	Wait wait wait wait wait what	0.0
Wait wait wait wait wait what	So then 974 divide by  I got 974	3.0
So then 974 divide by  I got 974	Because youre not multiplying youre adding all of them  And then  Im dividing right now	4.0
Because youre not multiplying youre adding all of them  And then  Im dividing right now	No dont	1.0
No dont	We cant  put 21 into 100	1.0
We cant  put 21 into 100	The teachers going to yell at you	0.0
The teachers going to yell at you	I know but I dont	0.0
I know but I dont	Okay so now I need to 971 divided by 21	1.0
Okay so now I need to 971 divided by 21	Is that what we would be doing	1.0
Is that what we would be doing	One two three four five six seven eight nine	0.0
One two three four five six seven eight nine	Whyd you put it right there	2.0
And Im going to make them kind of smaller so everybody gets a chance to share	Where did Emelia go	0.0
So hopefully shell make it back	Are there only supposed to be three people in a group	0.0
About two to three	inauidble	0.0
inauidble	Okay um I think that nine 095 is bigger than 03 because three would only inaudible and zero point 95 is bigger than three	4.0
Okay um I think that nine 095 is bigger than 03 because three would only inaudible and zero point 95 is bigger than three	What I said it will work because zero point 95 is bigger than 03	4.0
Hunter Do you agree with Lionel	Yeah	1.0
How can you justify that	Cuz a 095 is a hundred and 030 is in the tenths	4.0
It was decimals	inauidble zero	3.0
Cooper what do you think	No	0.0
No	Like when like her first thing is correct but then her strategy is not	4.0
Like when like her first thing is correct but then her strategy is not	Because it says like just three instead of she doesnt have any zeros there	4.0
Because it says like just three instead of she doesnt have any zeros there	So that doesnt make it really correct	4.0
what did you say at first	Well kind of saying was that 30 that 03 is 30 and zero point 95 is bigger	4.0
Cooper do you have another example	not really	0.0
Does it work to do it like that	Oh wait	0.0
Would it be okay just to say four is less than 76	Yes	0.0
Once you think about that is it really four	No	0.0
River what do you think	I think it one is incorrect because the 03 is equivalent to 30000ths	4.0
I think it one is incorrect because the 03 is equivalent to 30000ths	And if you do zero point 35 is less than equal to or greater than 04	4.0
And if you do zero point 35 is less than equal to or greater than 04	But four is equivalent to 40000ths	4.0
But four is equivalent to 40000ths	Making 35000ths less than 40000ths proving her wrong	4.0
And Carter do you have an example to justify why it wont work that way	I mean technically have like the same answers as River	1.0
So you agree with River	inauidble the problem I recognized and was gonna have the same answer as River	1.0
And well do some more talking in just a few	Back inauidble the meeting andI just saw on chat on on mute and then turn this camera off	0.0
Back inauidble the meeting andI just saw on chat on on mute and then turn this camera off	finally came off of his camera he left the meeting	0.0
Thank you	He didnt share yet	0.0
MSkylerssa what do you notice about that problem	I noticed that it is the exact same numbers that it was in the last problem	3.0
What do you notice about that MSkylerssa	That	0.0
Tell us what do you notice about the word problem	The measurements are different	3.0
Emelia	I think that Skyler Skyler used more dental floss because Paulina	4.0
I think that Skyler Skyler used more dental floss because Paulina	So four tenths is equal to 40 hundredths	4.0
So four tenths is equal to 40 hundredths	And 40 is greater than is less than 56	4.0
And 40 is greater than is less than 56	So thats how I figure if I use 56	4.0
So thats how I figure if I use 56	So Skyler used more	4.0
Okay Liam or River go ahead River	I would like to add on to that	1.0
I would like to add on to that	I saw that 56 zero point 56 is 56000ths	4.0
I saw that 56 zero point 56 is 56000ths	So when you look at it that way you see that that is more than half	4.0
So when you look at it that way you see that that is more than half	And that zero point 40 is less than half	4.0
And why would it be easier	It looks different because it has looks different because at the top two swimmers were at a point 68 thats different	4.0
It looks different because it has looks different because at the top two swimmers were at a point 68 thats different	As usually it would only be zero point 68	4.0
As usually it would only be zero point 68	And	0.0
Are you trying to say that This actually has more than one	Yeah	0.0
What do you notice after the decimal point with this	They have more numbers	3.0
68 what	hundredths	3.0
33	Hundredths	3.0
Does that make it easier to compare	Yes	0.0
And so which one is grater	The one that is greater is the 5868	3.0
Were gonna have a math discussion using math terms	inaudible because 900ths and 009 And 09 to 09 is nine is 100 Is 90 And 009 is just like 9	4.0
Whoa that was good thinking	I would agree with that	1.0
Yeah	So Justin got 009 way off	3.0
Where should that 009 be	It should be on the ninth millimeter	3.0
So you look at the nine tenths and the nine tenths is really how many hundreds	90 hundredths	3.0
Compared to nine hundreds is how many pennies	9 hundredths is like nine pennies	3.0
We all said what	No	1.0
Emelia what do we know about those	That 900ths is nine and nine tenths is 90	3.0
what would be a good way to say that	Austin is incorrect because The 009 is way off	4.0
Austin is incorrect because The 009 is way off	09	4.0
Could you say way less	Yeah	0.0
How many hundredths	90	3.0
Do you guys agree with that	Yeah	1.0
And Nice job guys	33 I like numbers that have the same number for both	0.0
33 I like numbers that have the same number for both	Hi Ms Tolliver	0.0
did you guys finish number four	Yeah	0.0
Do you agree	We decided We agree	1.0
you agree	First of all we disagreed	1.0
First of all we disagreed	But then I but then I looked at it more and then I realized that it theyre pretty much the same fractions	3.0
But if I put it out of 100 how many hundreds would it be	90	3.0
Its nine	I disagree	1.0
I disagree	I disagree now	1.0
Oh why do you disagreeNow Leah	Because I see now that it says if we put them both in the 100ths then its nine out of 100	4.0
Because I see now that it says if we put them both in the 100ths then its nine out of 100	So that means its its right like at the beginning kind of	4.0
Oh so id you say 900 is less than 90 hundreds	Yeah	0.0
Hollis how are you feeling about this	Im feeling like a three	0.0
why theyre not equal	Yeah	0.0
Nice work guys	Miss Tolliver	0.0
Uh huh	First we all said no	0.0
First we all said no	But then we changed it to Yes	0.0
But then we changed it to Yes	Because I saw it as like the nine out of 100	4.0
Because I saw it as like the nine out of 100	All those big marks would be 10	4.0
All those big marks would be 10	So then nine would be almost the last one before one to one because then I thought of one as 10	4.0
So then nine would be almost the last one before one to one because then I thought of one as 10	And then I thought of 90 well and then the 90 if Mark would be right there also	4.0
And then I thought of 90 well and then the 90 if Mark would be right there also	Ah	0.0
When we talk about words Liliana what does multi mean	Its theres two steps to the problem	3.0
Who can share with How about Emanual what are you going to be doing with your small group today	Were going to be trying to figure out that number like problem	3.0
Were almost there	Okay Im gonna underline that	0.0
Okay Im gonna underline that	During 378 customers on the west side and 137 Yes	0.0
During 378 customers on the west side and 137 Yes	Can you restart because we didnt join in time	0.0
Can you restart because we didnt join in time	Okay	0.0
Okay	Each day a company delivers newspapers to the town of Waylen	0.0
Each day a company delivers newspapers to the town of Waylen	It adds 158 customers on the north side of the town 378 customers on the west side and 237 customers on the south side	0.0
It adds 158 customers on the north side of the town 378 customers on the west side and 237 customers on the south side	The company received 900 newspapers to deliver	0.0
The company received 900 newspapers to deliver	How many will be left over	0.0
Hunter what do you think	How many newspapers I think will be left once its over is about 100	3.0
How many newspapers I think will be left once its over is about 100	200	3.0
So what operation does that give you a clue you may be doing to figure out this problem	Subtraction	3.0
Lucille what did you get for your number model on one seat	I put the n for the newspaper	3.0
I put the n for the newspaper	And I was doing minus 900	3.0
Do you think that would give you your answer	No	0.0
Hunter what are you thinking	Im thinking that you should do 300 minus and then you put all of the customers and all the sides	4.0
Im thinking that you should do 300 minus and then you put all of the customers and all the sides	And those little things are like this and then equals on	4.0
Curtis what do you think about that	So I would think I wait what do I think about his answer	0.0
So he said 300 minus and you put all the numbers in parentheses and add those together equals n	Its 900	3.0
Lucille what is N stands for	Newspapers	3.0
Curtis	I rounded up	3.0
I rounded up	I counted all the customers	3.0
I counted all the customers	Its 776	3.0
Can you explain what you did to get that answer	I added up all the customers through So I added 600 all the 100 150 all the tens and 23 for all the ones	4.0
Margaret	Estimate how much it will about be	3.0
Hey Hunter what did you get for your estimate	I got about 120	3.0
What strategy did you use for estimating	So I did the same estimate as my number model but I rounded down to the nearest 10	4.0
So I did the same estimate as my number model but I rounded down to the nearest 10	And then I subtracted 780 from 900 to get 120	4.0
What Hunter	You can we could run that to the nearest 100	3.0
Are you guys doing okay	Arthurs not telling us what he got for his answer	0.0
Arthur did you get an answer	So I got my answer	0.0
So I got my answer	My answer	0.0
Ill be right back	So Arthur can you please tell us what you got for your answer	2.0
What was your first dancer	three	3.0
Curtis	377 papers left	3.0
Okay does everybody agree	I mean 337	3.0
Does anybody agree or disagree	I disagree	1.0
I disagree	I got 127 papers	3.0
I got 127 papers	And I got my answer by partial sums	4.0
And I got my answer by partial sums	And when I added all the numbers up I got 773	4.0
And when I added all the numbers up I got 773	And then I subtracted the numbers	4.0
And then I subtracted the numbers	And 900 minus 773 cannot equal anything thats in the three hundreds	4.0
Margaret what do you think about that	I agree	1.0
Did you also get 127 for that	Yeah	0.0
Lucille what do you think you might say	I think I may say what method I did and how I got my answer	3.0
How close is your answer to the estimate	Its only seven away	3.0
Awesome job	Because two	0.0
Because two	Lets move on to number two	0.0
What did you guys come up with for your answer and estimate	What I put for my answer well we came up with our answer is 129	4.0
What I put for my answer well we came up with our answer is 129	Okay so what I did was I added up 237 and 158 to get 378	4.0
Okay so what I did was I added up 237 and 158 to get 378	And then I did um then I added the other two up and then I got 493	4.0
And then I did um then I added the other two up and then I got 493	And then I and then when I added those 493 and 378	4.0
And then I and then when I added those 493 and 378	I got 871 and then I did 871 minus 900 to get 129	4.0
I got 871 and then I did 871 minus 900 to get 129	And my estimate was 130	4.0
Do you want to hear why	Yes	0.0
And see what you come up with	Okay	0.0
Okay	Three seventyeight one two	3.0
Why did you say Ah Desmond	I just figured it out	0.0
I just figured it out	I a little bit figured it out	0.0
What did you figure out	I figured out I actually did do it wrong but just a little bit	3.0
What did you guys come up with your answer	Got 391	3.0
Wait is that when you added and then subtract it from 900	No thats the one that I did	0.0
No thats the one that I did	I did 158 and 237	3.0
And that might make it a little more efficient for you	Im not I dont really Im Im not very good at that method but	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
And then what did you guys get for your estimate on number one	I got 130	3.0
And did you round to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100	I think nearest 10	3.0
Okay and then you subtracted	Yeah	0.0
Desmond can you read number two	I will yeah	0.0
I will yeah	New Hyde Park Village	0.0

So right now see if you can do it	Add them all up	3.0
Okay	Youre going to have to add them up	3.0
Youre going to have to add them up	But first but after when theyre all added up you have to subtract that number from the how many newspapers they	3.0
It says what		3.0
Emanual what did you do for your equation	I just did	0.0
I just did	I did all the all the numbers of them together	3.0
I did all the all the numbers of them together	And I just said equals y	3.0
And I just said equals y	With the unknown	3.0
What do you think about that	What Im going to try to do first is Im going to take all the biggest numbers then add them together	3.0
What Im going to try to do first is Im going to take all the biggest numbers then add them together	And then but Im going to round to the nearest 100 first	3.0
Youre rounding	Yeah	0.0
Does that make sense	Uhhuh	0.0
Uhhuh	I was wondering where everybody else was	0.0
Okay	Okay	0.0
Okay	Thank you	0.0
So go ahead and get started labeling your pizzas	Okay so I drew the things	0.0
Okay so I drew the things	So I got the  down	0.0
So I got the  down	Its a little noisy on my side	0.0
Okay so what do you guys think you might start out with	Well I think	0.0
Emmett you can go	Okay	0.0
Okay	I think that you could divide the pizzas	3.0
I think that you could divide the pizzas	Well Im going to start with the three pictures and five kids and five people	1.0
Well Im going to start with the three pictures and five kids and five people	So I think that would be each person gets um	1.0
Liam do you have a question	I started dividing them out and each of them gets one Well theres still four pieces of pizza left	3.0
Okay so for the first one how many pizzas were there	There were	0.0
You did what	I accidentally divided the river by five	3.0
So what would be a good strategy to divide those pizzas	For the first problem	0.0
I dont know what happened	Can you hear me now	0.0
Yes	Okay	0.0
Okay	So the for the four students at the Forest Preserve	4.0
So the for the four students at the Forest Preserve	And I started by dividing the fractions into fourths	4.0
And I started by dividing the fractions into fourths	And each student got three fourths of the pizza	4.0
Okay	I agree	1.0
Okay	Okay so in the corner	0.0
Hows it going	Good	0.0
Can you guys turn your cameras on	Sure	0.0
Okay and where have you gotten so far	Um were on to question one right now	0.0
Okay and where you have the three pizzas and how many people are sharing those three pizzas	If we have three pizzas there is four student sharing in Forest Preserve five students sharing four pizzas at the corn field	3.0
Hunter whats your idea	Um maybe like the first two we can divide it into one like well in half and then the last one divided into one fourth	4.0
Do you guys agree with that	Yeah	1.0
How much would those four students get if you did that	They would get	0.0
Okay Im going to share my camera and see if if I have my three pizzas here and Hunter said divide the first two in half and divide the last one in fourths because we have four people sharing so they would get one half	A half and a fourth	3.0
What do you know	Yeah	0.0
When you think about fourths how many fourths equal a half	Two	3.0
Two	Oh	0.0
Oh so what do you think Hunter	It might be two fourths	3.0
So instead of saying a half and a fourth you could say	Three fourths	3.0
Are both ways correct	Yeah	1.0
How many pieces	They share	0.0
They share	Five students share four pizzas	3.0
If theres five students what could you do with each pizza	You could divide it into	0.0
Hey guys which one are you on	Cornfield	0.0
And how many students are sharing how many pizzas	And were on the one that has four pizzas and five students	3.0
Go ahead Lacey	I say we should split all of them in fifths	3.0
I say we should split all of them in fifths	Like a rectangle	3.0
What would you do	I had the same idea	1.0
And what would you do to figure out how much each student gets then once you put each one into fifths	Theyd each get four fifths	3.0
Gordon what are we looking at next	To the meadow	0.0
And then how many how many students are sharing pizza in the meadow	I didnt have like the exact amount but I do know they have eight pizzas or they have seven pizzas	3.0
Lacey did you get an answer	Maybe seven eighths	3.0
Gordon what is seven eighths almost	Its almost a whole	3.0
Its almost a whole	Its almost one	1.0
Yeah because the whole would be how many pieces	Eight	3.0
Lacy what did you get	Three fifths for each	3.0
Gordon what are you thinking	Im thinking maybe seven eighths	3.0
And why do you think seven eighths	Because its almost a whole	4.0
Frankie	Four fifths	4.0
Four fifths	Because seven eighths movie like smaller slivers and four fifths would be bigger ones	4.0
What are you thinking	I think that seven eighths maybe bigger because theyre a littler pieces but it still makes a big whole	4.0
Which ones bigger	Probably four fifths	3.0
Which one appears to be bigger to you Zack	They look like theyre equal	3.0
Gordon	Seven eighths	3.0
Im going to pop in another room quickly	He was the last question	0.0
How are you guys doing	Good	0.0
Good	But um we dont really understand the second question	2.0
What did you guys figure out	Um we thought it was forest preserve	4.0
Um we thought it was forest preserve	Because because it has four pizzas and three	4.0
Because because it has four pizzas and three	It has four students and three pizzas	4.0
It has four students and three pizzas	And if we divided divided two pizzas into halves then each students out of the four students would get a half	4.0
And if we divided divided two pizzas into halves then each students out of the four students would get a half	And then we divided the third circle pizza into fourths because then each of the four students would get one fourth	4.0
And then we divided the third circle pizza into fourths because then each of the four students would get one fourth	And then each student would have three fourths	4.0
Ill be back	And then we can go	0.0
And then we can go	Okay so	0.0
Hey guys hows it going	Good	0.0
Good	We just didnt really understand the second question thatnwe didnt know what we were	2.0
Which one did you figure out was the biggest and why	The four students that went to the forest preserve	3.0
And so they were sharing how many pizzas		3.0
Okay	Yeah	0.0
Think about which fraction is closest to a whole and why	Seven eighths	3.0
Why do you Oh Liam go ahead	I think closer because because the little squares are smaller so if it was smaller theyd technically be closer	4.0
Which one has the most shaded in boys and girls	The meadow	3.0
Kenneth what are you thinkingOut of those four fractions which one would be the next biggest	Probably four fifths	3.0
Why do you think four fifths	Because four fifths are have would be closer than three fourths	4.0
Which one do you think is bigger Three fourths or three fifths	Three fourths	3.0
Liam what did you say before about seven eighths	I said seven eighths is closer because theres more tiny little pieces and this huge one	4.0
So I will join another group quickly and see how theyre doing	Three pizzas	3.0
Three pizzas	Okay	0.0
Okay	I am going to backspace	0.0
I am going to backspace	Yes	0.0
Hey Mariana how are you guys doing	Check	0.0
Check	We finished question one and question two	0.0
What did you get for question one	We got that greatest pizza was the eight students that had the seven pizzas	3.0
How did you get that	We got that because were looking at our diagram	4.0
We got that because were looking at our diagram	All the other ones were smaller than the seven and the eight	4.0
And seven eighths is closest to what	Seven eighths is closer to 10	3.0
Yes Parker	I realized something	0.0
Whats that	Four and five and four also yeah four out of five that thats also the same and three out of four	4.0
Four and five and four also yeah four out of five that thats also the same and three out of four	So thats also the same	4.0
Which one do you think is bigger	I say five sixths	3.0
Im going to actually call us by Max what did you get for number one and why do you think its the biggest	So Ive picked that for number one wild meadow is the biggest because seven eighths if you do that its just a small sliver left of our pizza	4.0
Lacy	I think that seven eighths is bigger because theyre for example four fifths it has much more left over than the seven eighths	4.0
Mariana	So what I did for number two was hold on	0.0
So what I did for number two was hold on	I did	0.0
I did	Things being glitchy	0.0
Things being glitchy	Okay there we go	0.0
Okay there we go	Is my diagram is I have four students with three pizzas five students with four pizzas eight students with seven pizzas and five students with three pizzas	4.0
Kenna	We did seven eighths is greater than four fifths four fifths is greater than three fourths and then three fourths is greater than three fifths	4.0
Frankie do you want to share your explanation	For which one	0.0
How do we know seven eighths is bigger than four fifths	I thought that four I thought that four fifths would is bigger would be bigger because they would have bigger slices then seven eighths	4.0
What did we actually figure out	That was seven eighths because it had a bigger whole	4.0
So when you turn in your your whole thing you would have the whole you would have everything to turn it	Why	0.0
Can you come up and put your journal under here and share what you did	I had a circle and I did eight eighths	4.0
I had a circle and I did eight eighths	I thought it would be faster so I did one eighth times eight would equal eight eighths or one	4.0
Harold what did he do	He did the same thing as me which is use the multiplication times tables	1.0
Oh wow	I did tenths	3.0
Explain your equation here on the bottom	I did one tenth times 10 because if you did one tenth that would be 10 and I got 10 tenths or one	4.0
Marylin come on up	For mine I did fourths and I did one fourth plus one fourth plus one fourth plus one fourth equals four fourths or one	4.0
She has her addition equation and Marylin what would be the multiplication equation	one fourth times four equals four fourths or one	4.0
Its really good	I did eighths and I went four eighths plus four eighths equals eight eighths	4.0

I would like River and I would like Grant	Who else is with us	0.0
Who else is with us	Me	0.0
Me	Im going to have you guys go to the back of the room over there	0.0
Some of you said yes at first	I said yes	0.0
What did you do at first and then how did you revise your thinking	What I did at first was I divided it like this and gave the half to the oldest daughter and then I divided this into thirds and gave one third to one daughter and another third to another daughter	4.0
What I did at first was I divided it like this and gave the half to the oldest daughter and then I divided this into thirds and gave one third to one daughter and another third to another daughter	Then I said Queen Arlene gets a third of the land	4.0
Then I said Queen Arlene gets a third of the land	Then I realized that the queen right here decided to keep the land so I knew that Queen Arlene didnt really want the land in this question	4.0
Then I realized that the queen right here decided to keep the land so I knew that Queen Arlene didnt really want the land in this question	Then I realized that the oldest daughter still got half but then if the queen wouldnt want a third of this land I erased the third and divided the half in half to get each of the youngest daughters gets one fourth	4.0
One half plus one fourth plus one fourth does it equal one	Yeah	0.0
Can you read your explanation Ray	No Queen Arlene cant do it because if you divide the rectangle into two halves and then divide one half into another two halves that would equal two fourths or one half and then give the youngest two daughters one fourth and give the oldest daughter the other half then Queen Arlene to give all the daughters a piece of land and also the youngest two daughters would get one fourth not one third of the land	4.0
Grant can you come up and share	I thought it was no in the beginning	4.0
I thought it was no in the beginning	I divided two sisters first and then I drew a half over here to show that it would not work because theres not enough to put a half there	4.0
I divided two sisters first and then I drew a half over here to show that it would not work because theres not enough to put a half there	Thats basically what it says in my words here	0.0
How did you get your answer then	I got my answer for no or for the second one	0.0
For the first one	I got my answer by pretty much looking at it and seeing that one half is not equal to one third	3.0
Rory would you come up and share what you got for number two	For number two I also on the diagram since I know shes keeping one half of her land that means the whole is going to be one half	4.0
For number two I also on the diagram since I know shes keeping one half of her land that means the whole is going to be one half	This I said was one half and out of that one half she would get two eighths the youngest sister would get two eighths two eighths and then the youngest sister would get four eighths	4.0
This I said was one half and out of that one half she would get two eighths the youngest sister would get two eighths two eighths and then the youngest sister would get four eighths	If you had the one two sixteenths two sixteenths and four sixteenths	4.0
What does that mean	No I was just doing that so that you would see that this is a half	3.0
Well if you basically put the two eighths plus two eighths together how much is that	Four sixteenths	3.0
Its actually four eighths and four eighths is really what	Four eighths is really	0.0
Four eighths is really	I dont know	2.0
Its a half	Its a half	0.0
If you put a half plus a half you get	One	3.0
Heres his equation at the bottom but instead of two sixteenths plus two sixteenths plus four sixteenths what are you going to change that to	One half or the eight sixteenths	3.0
Marie can you come up and share what you had	Okay	0.0
Okay	I started by the queen has one half and so I started by before I did the one fourth and that one eighth I did the oldest one would get two thirds and the younger sisters would each get one sixth	4.0
I started by the queen has one half and so I started by before I did the one fourth and that one eighth I did the oldest one would get two thirds and the younger sisters would each get one sixth	I did one sixth plus one sixth was one third and one third plus one third equals one but I figured out that this is only half of the land so then I changed it to one fourth and one eighth and one eighth	4.0
I did one sixth plus one sixth was one third and one third plus one third equals one but I figured out that this is only half of the land so then I changed it to one fourth and one eighth and one eighth	I know one fourth plus one eighth plus one eighth would equal one half and one half plus one half is a whole	4.0
Does everybody agree with Marie on this problem	Yes	0.0
Ray do you want to share something else	I did the same thing as Marie except I drew it a different way	1.0
I did the same thing as Marie except I drew it a different way	The queen still gets her half and the oldest daughter gets one fourth of the land and the two younger daughters get one eighth of the land	4.0
The queen still gets her half and the oldest daughter gets one fourth of the land and the two younger daughters get one eighth of the land	Then I did one half plus one fourth plus two eighths equals one	4.0
Grant did you get something different	I got something different	1.0
Oh come up and share	I did a lot of explaining on this	0.0
I did a lot of explaining on this	I ended up with each sister the older sister gets a fourth out of sixteenths because the mom wants to get half of her	4.0
What is four out of 16	Four out of 16 is	0.0
Whats equivalent to four sixteenths	One fourth	3.0
If you divide by four on the top and bottom you get one fourth	Oh	0.0
Does that make sense	Yes	0.0
They got an 80Is an 80 higher than this unit two grid	Yes	0.0
Is that higher than any of these prior overall units	No	0.0
Right Im seeing a little bit more struggles on this one which I expect because now we have the variable on both sides of the equation which always makes it a little bit harder to deal with	Im confused	2.0
